### [1] [Uncovering Implicit Bias in Large Language Models with Concept Learning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01219)
*Leroy Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过上下文概念学习实验发现，语言模型在量词理解上存在向上单调性偏见，这种偏见在直接提示测试中不明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示大型语言模型中存在的隐性偏见，特别是通过概念学习任务来发现那些在直接测试中不易察觉的偏见。

Method: 使用上下文概念学习实验，通过概念学习组件来测试语言模型对量词的理解，并与直接提示方法进行对比。

Result: 发现语言模型在量词理解上存在向上单调性偏见，这种偏见在概念学习任务中明显，但在直接提示测试中不明显。

Conclusion: 上下文概念学习是发现语言模型中隐藏偏见的有效方法，能够揭示在常规测试中不易察觉的系统性偏见。

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [2] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri Aïdasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张NLP研究应从静态数据收集转向交互式语言发现范式，通过人机对话动态学习低资源语言，结合模型认知不确定性和人类犹豫信号来指导学习过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言NLP面临文本语料匮乏、标准化拼写缺失和可扩展标注流程不足的根本限制。现有大语言模型依赖海量预收集数据和集中式基础设施，无法惠及弱势语言社区。

Method: 提出基于联合人机不确定性的框架，结合模型的认知不确定性和说话者的犹豫提示与置信信号，指导交互、查询选择和记忆保留，实现参与式、共适应的学习过程。

Result: 这是一个概念性框架，尚未报告具体实验结果，但提出了新的研究方向和范式转变。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新思考AI与人类知识在未充分记录语言中的互动方式，从提取式数据收集转向尊重并赋能社区的参与式学习过程，保护世界语言多样性。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

### [3] [Discourse vs emissions: Analysis of corporate narratives, symbolic practices, and mimicry through LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01222)
*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型分析美国上市公司气候信息披露成熟度，发现风险导向叙述与承诺一致但量化目标脱节，大公司披露更多但缺乏一致性，普遍模仿行为降低了信息价值


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化增加了对企业气候信息披露透明度和可比性的需求，但模仿性和象征性报告往往削弱了其价值

Method: 开发多维框架评估828家美国上市公司的披露成熟度，使用针对气候沟通微调的大型语言模型，通过四个分类器（情感、承诺、具体性、目标雄心）从可持续性和年度报告中提取叙述指标

Result: 风险导向叙述通常与明确承诺一致，但量化目标与语气脱节；大公司和高排放公司披露更多承诺和行动，但与量化目标不一致；披露风格普遍相似表明模仿行为，降低了区分度和决策有用性

Conclusion: LLM在ESG叙述分析中具有价值，需要更强有力的监管来将承诺与可验证的转型策略联系起来

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

### [4] [Context Matters: Comparison of commercial large language tools in veterinary medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01224)
*Tyler J Poore,Christopher J Pinard,Aleena Shabbir,Andrew Lagree,Andre Telfer,Kuan-Chuen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估三种兽医专用LLM总结工具在肿瘤记录上的表现，使用LLM作为评判框架，发现Product 1表现最佳，并验证了该评估方法的高度可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在临床应用中日益普及，但在兽医医学领域的性能尚未充分探索，需要评估兽医专用LLM工具的有效性。

Method: 使用标准化的兽医肿瘤记录数据集，通过基于量表的LLM作为评判框架，从五个维度（事实准确性、完整性、时间顺序、临床相关性、组织性）对三种商业兽医LLM总结工具进行评分。

Result: Product 1表现最优，中位平均得分4.61（IQR:0.73），而Product 2和3分别为2.55和2.45。Product 1在事实准确性和时间顺序方面获得满分中位分。评估框架本身具有高可重复性，三次独立运行的标准差很小。

Conclusion: 兽医专用商业LLM工具的重要性得到证实，LLM作为评判的评估方法是兽医医学临床NLP总结评估的可扩展且可重复的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

### [5] [ClaimCheck: Real-Time Fact-Checking with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01226)
*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck是一个基于小语言模型的自动事实核查系统，通过模块化流程使用网络证据进行事实核查，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统依赖大型闭源模型和静态知识库，存在透明度低、计算成本高的问题。需要开发更透明、高效且可解释的事实核查方法。

Method: 采用分步验证流程：网络搜索查询规划、基于网络的证据检索和总结、证据合成和重新检索、声明裁决评估。每个模块都针对小语言模型优化。

Result: 在AVeriTeC数据集上达到76.4%的最先进准确率，使用仅4B参数的Qwen3模型超越了使用LLaMA3.1 70B和GPT-4o的先前方法。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的模块化架构和提示策略，小语言模型可以克服其局限性，实现高效准确的事实核查，为透明和可访问的事实核查系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

### [6] [EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227)
*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 当前数学基准测试可能高估了大型语言模型的推理能力，作者提出了EEFSUVA新基准来更全面地评估数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准主要基于IMO等知名竞赛，可能存在数据污染问题，且问题类型单一，无法全面评估LLM的真实数学推理能力。

Method: 从东欧和前苏联地区较少流通的区域性和国家级奥赛题目中构建EEFSUVA基准，这些题目难度与IMO相当但解题方法更独特。

Result: 即使在现有奥赛基准上表现优异的先进LLM，在EEFSUVA基准上的表现也显著下降。

Conclusion: 需要更广泛的评估数据集来全面评估数学推理能力，并为未来模型开发提供指导。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [7] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在处理系统提示与用户输入冲突时，会优先遵循社交线索而非指令层次结构，揭示了机制层面的冲突检测与解决模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型应该遵循指令层次结构（系统提示优先于用户输入），但现有研究表明它们经常忽略这一规则，而更倾向于服从社交线索如权威或共识。

Method: 使用线性探测分析冲突决策信号的编码位置，通过直接对数归因揭示内部冲突检测机制，并进行向量引导实验验证模型行为。

Result: 系统-用户冲突和社交冲突形成不同的子空间；系统-用户冲突检测更强但解决不一致；社交线索向量意外地以角色无关方式增强指令遵循。

Conclusion: 结果解释了系统服从的脆弱性，并强调需要开发轻量级的层次敏感对齐方法。

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

### [8] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Rerankers with Synthetic Data and LLM-Based Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01229)
*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种无需人工标注的文档重排方法，使用LLM生成合成查询并标注正负样本对，然后用对比学习微调小型transformer模型，在降低计算成本的同时保持强大的重排能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文档重排方面表现出色但计算成本高，而微调小型模型又依赖稀缺的人工标注数据，需要找到平衡计算效率和性能的方法。

Method: 使用LLM从领域语料生成合成查询，用LLM分类器标注正负样本对，构建合成数据集，然后用LCE损失通过对比学习微调小型transformer模型。

Result: 在MedQuAD数据集上，该方法显著提升了领域内性能，并在领域外任务上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM用于数据生成和监督而非推理，可以在降低计算成本的同时保持强大的重排能力，为文档重排任务提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

### [9] [Geometric Structures and Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Chinese Character Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01230)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用PHATE流形分析系统研究汉字嵌入的几何模式，发现内容词呈现聚类模式，功能词呈现分支模式，几何复杂度与语义内容相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统研究汉字嵌入中的几何模式，为传统语言学理论提供计算证据，建立语义组织的几何分析新框架。

Method: 使用PHATE流形分析，对7个嵌入模型和8种降维方法进行交叉验证，分析1000多个汉字在12个语义域中的分布。

Result: 有意义字符展现丰富的几何多样性，结构部首坍缩为紧密聚类；子网络分析显示从基本字符到短语的系统性语义扩展。

Conclusion: 几何复杂度与语义内容相关，为传统语言学理论提供了计算支持，建立了语义组织几何分析的新框架。

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

### [10] [Trustworthy Summarization via Uncertainty Quantification and Risk Awareness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01231)
*Shuaidong Pan,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成不确定性量化和风险感知机制的大语言模型框架，用于高风险场景下的可靠自动摘要生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高风险场景下自动摘要的可靠性问题，应对信息过载和高风险决策的需求。

Method: 构建基于条件生成的摘要模型，引入贝叶斯推理建模参数空间不确定性，使用预测分布熵衡量不确定性，结合熵正则化和风险感知损失进行联合优化，并集成风险评分和调控模块。

Result: 比较实验和敏感性分析验证该方法显著提高了高风险应用中摘要的鲁棒性和可靠性，同时保持了流畅性和语义完整性。

Conclusion: 为可信摘要提供了系统性解决方案，在方法论层面展示了可扩展性和实用价值。

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

### [11] [Benchmark Profiling: Mechanistic Diagnosis of LLM Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01232)
*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Benchmark Profiling诊断框架，通过梯度重要性评分和参数消融将基准测试性能分解为10种认知能力，量化每种能力对模型表现的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试分数往往高估真实能力，因为掩盖了任务实际需要的技能组合，缺乏系统方法来验证基准测试是否真正测量其声称的能力标签。

Method: 结合梯度重要性评分和针对性参数消融，计算能力影响分数(AIS)来量化每种认知能力对基准测试表现的贡献程度。

Result: 分析3个指令调优模型在10个基准测试上的表现发现：大多数基准测试依赖多种能力而非单一能力；相似标签的数据集依赖不同的能力组合；代码生成基准测试需要广泛的多技能改进；无关能力可能负面影响性能。

Conclusion: Benchmark Profiling解释了为什么性能提升不总是转化为用户感知的能力，并为基准测试审计和模型可解释性提供了透明工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

*Shubham Agrawal,Prasang Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMRank是一个提示感知的路由框架，通过提取任务类型、推理模式、复杂度指标等人类可读特征，使用神经网络排序模型预测每个模型的效用，实现LLM的高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在能力、延迟和计算成本方面差异巨大，如何为每个提示选择最合适的模型以优化性能与效率的权衡成为关键部署挑战。

Method: 从提示中提取丰富的可解释特征，包括任务类型、推理模式、复杂度指标、句法线索和轻量级代理求解器的信号，使用在RouterBench数据集上训练的神经网络排序模型预测每个模型的效用。

Result: LLMRank达到了89.2%的oracle效用，同时提供可解释的特征归因来解释路由决策。

Conclusion: 多方面的特征提取和混合排序目标对于高效透明的LLM部署至关重要，特征驱动的路由具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

*Ismam Nur Swapnil,Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DermIQ-VLM，一种通过多阶段、资源高效方法开发的视觉语言模型，用于皮肤病诊断，并引入了改进的GRPO++算法来稳定训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在皮肤病学等复杂领域中结构化推理能力受限的问题，主要挑战包括数据稀缺和高级训练技术的高计算成本。

Method: 采用多阶段训练流程：首先使用GRPO++进行疾病识别推理训练，然后通过监督微调提升对话能力，最后使用基于知识图谱的DPO对齐来减少事实错误。

Result: 在精心策划的皮肤病数据集上的初步评估显示，该方法相比标准微调方法取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 验证了该训练流程作为在资源受限环境中开发专业化、可靠视觉语言模型的可行途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

*Nandakishor M*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于置信度感知的路由系统，在生成前评估模型不确定性，根据可靠性估计重定向查询，显著减少幻觉并降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉问题，生成看似合理但事实错误的内容。现有缓解策略集中在生成后修正，计算成本高且无法阻止不可靠内容的生成

Method: 结合三种互补信号：内部表示与参考嵌入的语义对齐、跨模型层的内部收敛分析、学习置信度估计。统一置信度分数决定路由到四个路径：高置信度本地生成、中等置信度检索增强生成、低置信度更大模型、极低置信度人工审核

Result: 在知识密集型QA基准测试中，幻觉检测显著改进（0.74 vs 0.42基线），计算成本比后处理方法降低40%。F1分数从0.61提升到0.82，假阳性率低（0.09）

Conclusion: 从反应式修正转向主动评估的范式转变，为LLM可靠性增强提供了计算高效的方法

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Yonatan Belinkov,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现填充标记（padding tokens）在大型语言模型中的实现错误会影响模型计算，导致隐藏表示偏移、生成质量下降、偏见改变和安全防护减弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填充标记在批处理推理中被广泛使用，但实现错误可能导致它们影响计算，这种影响程度尚未被充分理解。

Method: 在三个开源模型家族（Llama、Gemma、Qwen）中插入受控数量的填充标记，并沿着四个维度评估结果：激活状态、生成质量、偏见和安全性。

Result: 即使少量填充也会导致隐藏表示偏移，在较小模型中降低生成质量，以不可预测的方式改变偏见，并削弱安全防护机制。

Conclusion: 填充不是无害的细节，而是部署中必须谨慎处理的鲁棒性风险。

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

*Juntae Lee,Jihwan Bang,Seunghan Yang,Simyung Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIFLEX是一种用于多轮交互中子任务处理的高效执行系统，通过重用主任务的KV缓存和注入特定指令到隔离侧路径来减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力增强，单个模型需要处理多样化的子任务来更有效地支持用户请求。传统方法在切换主任务和子任务时需要重新处理整个对话上下文，产生显著计算开销。

Method: 重用主任务的KV缓存，仅将任务特定指令注入到隔离的侧路径中。子任务执行后通过缓存上下文回滚到主路径，避免冗余的预填充计算。开发了针对小规模模型的分层分类策略来支持子任务选择。

Result: 实验表明CIFLEX显著降低了计算成本，同时不降低任务性能，实现了可扩展且高效的设备端多任务对话。

Conclusion: CIFLEX通过创新的上下文指令流和缓存重用机制，为设备端LLM提供了高效的多任务处理能力，解决了传统方法中的计算开销问题。

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两个互补的数学基准：SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH（100项结构化诊断集）和SKYLENAGE-MATH（150项竞赛式套件），用于评估LLM的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准存在天花板效应，需要更难的、以推理为中心的数学基准来评估LLM的数学能力。

Method: 创建了两个基准：1）100项结构化诊断集，包含长度、数值密度和符号复杂度等元数据；2）150项竞赛式套件，涵盖高中到博士四个阶段和七个学科。评估了15个当代LLM变体。

Result: 在竞赛套件上，最强模型达到44%准确率，从高中到博士准确率下降，顶级系统博士到高中的保留率约为79%。在推理集上，最佳模型总体达到81%，最难部分结果揭示了领先者与中游系统之间的稳健性差距。

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE提供了一个难度校准、元数据丰富的硬数学推理基准，可作为未来数学推理评估的参考基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

### [19] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ARGRE框架，通过建模毒性转换轨迹和构建自回归奖励模型，实现精确的LLM去毒化，在效果和效率上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM去毒方法在毒性-非毒性转换空间探索不足，导致干预不精确，需要更稳定和精确的测试时去毒策略。

Method: ARGRE框架：识别非毒性语义方向，在潜在表示空间中插值揭示细粒度转换轨迹，构建自回归奖励模型指导自适应两步编辑过程。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的LLM上实验显示，毒性降低62.21%，推理时间减少47.58%，同时保持模型核心能力最小退化。

Conclusion: ARGRE通过精确建模毒性转换和稳定奖励指导，实现了高效有效的LLM去毒化，为安全部署提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

*Hyeoneui Kim,Jeongha Kim,Huijing Xu,Jinsun Jung,Sunghoon Kang,Sun Joo Jang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了心理健康压力本体论(MeSO)，并使用大型语言模型从文本中提取结构化压力相关信息，准确率达到78.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压力对健康有重要影响，但在电子健康记录中通常以非结构化文本形式记录，限制了临床实用性。需要开发结构化方法来改善压力相关信息的提取和记录。

Method: 整合压力理论模型和11个验证过的压力评估工具，开发心理健康压力本体论(MeSO)。使用Claude Sonnet 4从35个Reddit帖子中提取六类压力相关信息，并通过人工评估准确性。

Result: 最终本体论包含8个顶层类和181个概念。在220个可提取的压力相关项目中，LLM正确识别了172个(78.2%)，错误分类27个(12.3%)，遗漏21个(9.5%)。所有正确提取的项目都能准确映射到MeSO。

Conclusion: 研究表明使用本体论引导的LLM从文本中提取结构化压力相关信息是可行的，有潜力提高环境AI系统中压力记录的一致性和实用性。

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

TL;DR: SeMob是一个基于LLM的语义合成管道，用于动态移动性预测。它通过多智能体框架从复杂在线文本中自动提取时空相关文本，并通过渐进融合架构将细粒度上下文与时空数据结合，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空模型难以利用描述外部事件的文本信息来预测人类移动性，特别是在处理突发事件导致的突然变化时表现不佳。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，LLM智能体自动从复杂在线文本中提取和推理时空相关文本；通过创新的渐进融合架构将细粒度相关上下文与时空数据结合；利用丰富的预训练事件先验知识。

Result: 在通过该管道构建的数据集上评估，SeMob相比时空模型在MAE和RMSE上分别最大降低了13.92%和11.12%；在事件发生位置和时间附近的时空区域表现出明显优势。

Conclusion: SeMob框架通过整合文本语义信息有效提升了动态移动性预测性能，特别是在事件驱动的预测场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

TL;DR: 提出基于稀疏自编码器（SAE）的top-1潜在特征选择和token-wise衰减引导策略，用于改善语言模型引导效果，在数学推理任务上优于均值激活差异方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有top-k SAE潜在特征包含过多非语义特征（如标点符号），而恒定SAE引导会产生退化输出（如重复单词），需要更精确的引导方法。

Method: 1）选择top-1最相关SAE潜在特征；2）引入token-wise衰减引导策略；3）与均值激活差异基线进行对比。

Result: SAE引导能可靠地引发逐步数学推理，提升推理质量，在数学推理基准上优于均值激活差异方法，在IF-Eval上性能相当。

Conclusion: SAE是有效的语言模型引导工具，通过精确特征选择和自适应引导策略，能显著提升模型推理能力。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

gap, we introduce \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}}, a benchmark designed to assess
LMs' understanding of traditional sports across 60 countries and 6 continents,
encompassing four distinct cultural categories. The dataset features 33,000
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across text and image modalities, each of

scenario-based. To evaluate model performance, we employ zero-shot, few-shot,
and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language
Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural
sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for
assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

Conclusion: SSTAG有效结合了LLM的语义能力和GNN的结构建模，解决了图学习的跨域泛化挑战，为大规模文本属性图提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Conclusion: LOCA为创建高质量科学语料库提供了可扩展且有效的方法，为科学AI的更可靠训练和评估铺平道路。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

Abstract: As social-media platforms emerge and evolve faster than the regulations meant
to oversee them, automated detoxification might serve as a timely tool for
moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual
transformer, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA SFT fine-tuning and prompting
techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在实体链接任务中需要资源密集的多轮推理来获得可靠的不确定性估计，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用自监督方法从单次LLM输出的token级特征估计不确定性，无需多次生成。

Result: 在多个LLM上的评估显示，该方法能有效检测低精度输出，且计算成本仅为传统方法的一小部分。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM实体链接工作流提供了一种计算成本有限的不确定性估计实用方案。

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

TL;DR: 本文质疑当前语音大语言模型偏见评估中使用的多项选择题格式的有效性，发现这种评估方法在不同任务和格式间的泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型的偏见评估主要依赖多项选择题格式，但这种方法是否能在其他任务格式中保持一致性尚未得到验证。

Method: 使用LoRA适配器微调三个SpeechLLMs，诱导它们偏好刻板印象、反刻板印象或中立答案，然后评估这些行为在其他MCQA基准和长文本生成任务中的泛化能力。

Result: 结果显示，MCQA偏见基准测试的性能无法可靠预测其他MCQA基准的性能，更重要的是无法预测长文本任务的性能。

Conclusion: 当前MCQA偏见基准在语音领域显示出有限的跨任务泛化能力，作者提出了一个评估套件来测量未来模型和基准的行为可转移性。

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

TL;DR: AI Watchman是一个纵向审计系统，用于测量和追踪大型语言模型随时间变化的拒绝行为，揭示公司内容审核政策的变化和差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出受到不透明且频繁变更的公司内容审核政策影响，这些拒绝行为反映了公司政策并塑造公共话语，需要透明度工具来监控这些黑盒过程。

Method: 使用包含400多个社会议题的数据集，对OpenAI的审核端点、GPT-4.1、GPT-5和DeepSeek（中英文版本）进行审计，分析拒绝行为的变化模式。

Result: 发现公司政策变化（包括未公开宣布的）可通过AI Watchman检测到，识别了公司和模型特定的内容审核差异，并对不同形式的拒绝进行了分类分析。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了纵向审计LLM的价值，AI Watchman是实施此类审计的一个有效系统，有助于提高LLM内容审核的透明度。

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RJE框架，通过检索-判断-探索机制改进知识图谱问答，使用专用辅助模块让小型LLM也能有效工作，在保持性能的同时大幅减少LLM调用和token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的KGQA方法存在局限：检索方法受限于检索质量，智能体方法过度依赖专有LLM。需要一种既能提升性能又能让小型开源LLM有效工作的高效框架。

Method: RJE框架包含三个核心组件：检索精炼推理路径、评估充分性、条件性探索额外证据。引入三个专用辅助模块：推理路径排序、问题分解、检索器辅助探索。

Result: 使用专有LLM（如GPT-4o-mini）时优于现有基线，小型开源LLM（3B和8B参数）无需微调也能获得有竞争力的结果。相比智能体方法显著减少LLM调用次数和token使用量。

Conclusion: RJE框架有效解决了KGQA中LLM使用的效率和可扩展性问题，为小型LLM在复杂推理任务中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的快速普及，智能系统在信息媒介中主导政治话语，但训练数据偏差、人类偏见和算法缺陷导致的政治偏见问题持续存在。

Method: 采用零样本分类方法，通过意识形态对齐、主题相关性、响应情感和客观性四个评估指标，对6个主流大语言模型的1800个响应进行分析。

Result: 结果显示所有6个LLM都表现出增强的自由-威权主义对齐，存在显著的推理替代和固定拒绝实例。

Conclusion: 研究强调了人机交互中的心理影响，内在偏见可能渗透公共话语，最终根据地区既有社会政治结构表现为趋同或极化，扭曲政治格局。

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型在不同提示策略下的安全边界和拒绝行为，评估模型在不同语言、角色扮演和指令层次下的响应一致性。

Method: 使用80次种子迭代测试多个危害领域，包括ZIP炸弹构建、合成卡号生成、不安全驾驶建议等，采用复合提示、角色扮演和语言变体等方法。

Result: 特定提示组合可将ZIP炸弹任务的协助率从0%提升至97.5%；德语和法语正式语体比英语更容易泄露信息；Linux终端角色扮演可绕过开发者规则；发现13%的提示对存在不一致响应。

Conclusion: 模型的安全边界高度依赖提示策略，存在显著的提示注入风险，不同推理栈的拒绝率差异达5-10个百分点，凸显了可复现性问题和安全评估的重要性。

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了OpenAI GPT-OSS-20b模型在低资源语言（豪萨语）环境下的安全漏洞，包括偏见、文化不敏感和事实错误，发现模型在礼貌语言提示下会放松安全协议，产生有害内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑模型对来自代表性不足社区用户的可靠性，特别是在低资源语言环境下的安全对齐表现。

Method: 使用豪萨语进行红队测试，通过最小化提示诱导模型生成有害内容，并进行了61人参与的调查验证模型错误。

Result: 模型产生严重事实错误（如认为杀虫剂和灭鼠剂可安全食用）、无法区分生熟食物、使用侮辱性谚语构建错误论点，98%的调查参与者确认这些物质有毒。

Conclusion: 这些问题源于语言奖励劫持现象，模型优先考虑目标语言的流畅输出而非安全和真实性，主要归因于低资源语言环境下安全调优不足。

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

Motivation: 现有的基于logits的AI文本检测器仅依赖对数概率统计，这种方法可能不够优化，需要更有效的检测方法。

Method: 提出AdaDetectGPT分类器，从训练数据中自适应学习见证函数，增强基于logits的检测器性能，并提供统计保证。

Result: 在多种数据集和LLM组合中，AdaDetectGPT几乎一致地改进了最先进方法，改进幅度最高可达58%。

Conclusion: AdaDetectGPT通过自适应学习见证函数，显著提升了AI生成文本的检测性能，为LLM文本检测提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成连贯文本方面表现出色，但其部署存在生成有害或不适当内容的风险，需要有效的安全防护机制。

Method: 采用渐进式自我反思技术，通过多轮自我评估动态修正输出；引入轻量级自我反思预测器，根据输入复杂度自适应确定最优反思轮数。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct上攻击成功率从77.5%降至5.9%，Llama-3.1-8B基础版从89.7%降至5.6%，Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct从44.4%降至3.8%，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 渐进式自我反思是一种可扩展的测试时方法，通过按输入风险配置文件动态分配计算资源来增强大语言模型安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

Motivation: 扩散大语言模型中的幻觉问题研究不足，现有方法基于单步生成信号，不适合多步去噪的D-LLMs。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为动作轨迹，识别对幻觉响应最具有信息量的子轨迹，利用多步去噪过程中的关键幻觉信号。

Result: 在各种开源D-LLMs上的实验表明，TraceDet持续改进幻觉检测性能，相比基线方法AUROC平均提升15.2%。

Conclusion: TraceDet通过利用D-LLMs多步去噪过程的中间信息，有效解决了现有幻觉检测方法不适用于扩散模型的问题。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes
how parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) can lower

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强的LLM（如ChatGPT Agent和Gemini-Pro）缺乏关于如何有效结合文本推理、编码和搜索的实用指导，需要解决如何优化工具使用的问题。

Method: 提出TUMIX集成框架，并行运行多个智能体，每个智能体采用不同的工具使用策略和答案路径，通过迭代共享和精炼响应来改进答案。

Result: 在关键推理基准测试中，TUMIX相比最先进的工具增强和测试时扩展方法，在Gemini-2.5-Pro和Gemini-2.5-Flash上平均准确率提升高达3.55%，推理成本相近。

Conclusion: 智能体多样性和质量至关重要，可以通过LLM自动优化智能体设计来增强。TUMIX可以在达到足够置信度时停止精炼，仅需49%的推理成本即可保持性能，进一步扩展可以实现更高性能但成本更高。

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

TL;DR: HiSpec是一种利用早期退出模型进行中间验证的分层推测解码框架，旨在解决推测解码中验证瓶颈问题，提高大模型推理吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码中验证阶段通常是瓶颈（比如3B模型为70B目标模型推测时，验证比token生成慢4倍），现有中间验证方法存在训练开销大、内存占用增加和准确性妥协等问题。

Method: 利用早期退出模型进行低开销中间验证，通过重用键值缓存和隐藏状态在草稿模型、中间验证器和目标模型之间，并定期验证中间验证器接受的草稿token。

Result: 在各种代表性基准测试和模型上的评估显示，HiSpec相比基线单层推测平均提高吞吐量1.28倍，最高可达2.01倍，且不损害准确性。

Conclusion: HiSpec通过利用早期退出模型实现高效中间验证，显著提高了推测解码的吞吐量，同时保持了准确性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline

*Maithili Kadam,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAG-EQA是一个提示框架，通过将因果事件图转换为自然语言陈述注入到LLM输入中，提升事件问答性能，在TORQUESTRA基准测试上平均准确率提高5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在一般语言任务上表现出色，但在需要因果或时间推理的事件类问题上表现不佳。

Method: 提出TAG-EQA框架，包含9种提示配置，结合三种策略（零样本、少样本、思维链）和三种输入模态（纯文本、纯图、文本+图），系统分析结构化知识如何辅助推理。

Result: 在TORQUESTRA基准测试上，TAG-EQA相比纯文本基线平均准确率提高5%，零样本设置下提升达12%，图增强思维链提示有效时提升达18%。

Conclusion: 因果图可以在不进行微调的情况下增强LLM的事件推理能力，为基于提示的问答提供了一种灵活的结构编码方式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义嵌入距离的无结构评估方法，用于低成本高效评估语言模型响应质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型响应评估方法要么过于昂贵（如LLM-as-a-Judge），要么远离真实条件（如字符串匹配、logprob），需要更实用且成本较低的解决方案

Method: 使用语义嵌入距离匹配目标候选与任意LM生成文本，采用参数少于100亿的嵌入模型，实现低计算成本的鲁棒分类

Result: 在3个数据集和3种不同LM架构上测试，回归得分约0.97，与人工标注者相比准确率约96%

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算成本相对较低且鲁棒的语言模型响应评估方案，适用于基准测试和产品质量评估

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Expert Question Decomposition (EQD)方法，通过两阶段微调框架和奖励函数指导子问题生成，在金融领域复杂问答中显著提升性能，仅需少量训练数据和单GPU即可实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在领域特定定量推理中的挑战，特别是在需要专业知识和复杂问答的领域，如金融领域。

Method: 基于两阶段微调框架的专家问题分解方法，使用奖励函数评估生成子问题对问答结果的改进效果。

Result: 在四个金融领域基准数据集上，EQD方法在不同大语言模型上持续提升问答性能0.6%到10.5%，推理时间与零样本提示相当。

Conclusion: 在领域特定问答中，单一支持性问题比详细指导步骤更有效，EQD方法在计算效率和性能方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSSFormer是一种递归稀疏结构化Transformer，通过递归推理、自适应稀疏注意力和自组织编码器结构，解决了传统Transformer在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer架构在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面存在挑战，主要由于刚性层堆叠、密集注意力依赖和位置编码限制。

Method: 集成三个创新组件：递归推理与记忆单元(R2MU)用于有界深度迭代推理，自适应稀疏注意力模块(ASAM)用于高效上下文选择，自组织编码器结构(SOES)用于无位置结构归纳。

Result: 在语言建模、多跳问答和结构敏感任务中，ReSSFormer在相同FLOPs和参数预算下持续优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: ReSSFormer展示了在可扩展性、效率和结构灵活性方面的优势，为Transformer架构提供了改进方向。

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLUE是一个基于隐藏状态的无参数验证器，通过分析LLM内部隐藏状态的几何特征来评估输出质量，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM输出质量的方法存在局限性：基于文本的方法容易过拟合表面特征，基于token概率的方法在不校准的模型上效果不佳。隐藏状态同时包含语义信息和置信度信息，提供了更丰富的评估信号。

Method: 提出CLUE验证器，无训练参数，通过计算推理轨迹的隐藏状态变化量，基于与历史成功/失败簇的最近质心距离进行分类。

Result: 在AIME 24/25和GPQA基准测试中，CLUE持续优于LLM-as-a-judge基线，匹配或超过现代基于置信度的方法。在AIME 24上，使用1.5B模型将准确率从56.7%提升到70.0%。

Conclusion: LLM内部隐藏状态包含丰富的正确性信号，可以构建简单有效的验证器，为LLM输出质量评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs),
Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

significant improvements over baselines, with our best model achieving
substantial gains across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics, advancing the state

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PureTC-1B是一个针对Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct模型的三阶段稳定化管道，通过参数高效的LoRA适配器解决传统中文（TC）模型中的令牌级不稳定性问题，显著减少了非TC字符输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型（SLMs）在传统中文部署中存在令牌级不稳定性问题，模型会不可预测地输出非TC字符或切换到其他语言，这阻碍了成本效益高、设备端和延迟敏感的AI应用。

Method: 采用三阶段稳定化管道：1）在TC中心语料库上进行持续预训练（CPT）；2）使用指令数据进行监督微调（SFT）；3）使用TC一致性偏好进行直接偏好优化（DPO），通过参数高效的LoRA适配器实现，无需完整模型重新训练。

Result: 在模拟真实世界使用的基准测试中，PureTC-1B相比基础模型实现了51.3%的非TC输出令牌相对减少。在命名实体翻译任务中，相比Llama-3B和Qwen-1.5B分别减少了77.2%和57.2%的错误语言令牌。

Conclusion: 即使在1B规模下，也能实现稳健的TC一致性。该管道可重现、仅使用适配器且硬件友好，为从业者提供了增强传统中文及其他非英语语言稳定性的实用方法。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体系统受限于不灵活的固定图拓扑结构，缺乏上下文响应性，导致在不同学术和商业工作负载中效果下降，需要解决这些限制。

Method: 引入AMAS框架，通过新颖的动态图设计器组件，利用轻量级LLM适配自动识别任务特定的最优图配置，基于输入特性智能引导查询通过任务优化的智能体路径。

Result: 在问答、数学推理和代码生成等多个基准测试中，AMAS系统地超越了最先进的单智能体和多智能体方法，适用于不同的LLM架构。

Conclusion: 上下文敏感的结构适应性是高性能LLM多智能体系统部署的基本要求，AMAS框架为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型存在漏洞，恶意用户可以通过操纵输入文本来获取不良响应（越狱提示），这些提示旨在绕过安全防护措施。

Method: 使用不同机器学习模型区分越狱提示和真实使用，包括识别使用新策略的越狱，通过微调BERT模型进行端到端训练。

Result: 在当前数据集上，微调BERT模型在识别越狱提示方面表现最佳，可视化分析显示越狱提示与真实提示的关键词差异。

Conclusion: 提示结构中的显式自反性可能是越狱意图的信号，微调BERT模型能有效检测越狱提示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归LLM在语言理解生成方面表现出色，但在文本嵌入任务中应用缓慢，且单向注意力机制限制了语义表示分析，需要克服这一约束

Method: 通过额外训练步骤测试Llama架构的不同变体，逐步启用双向注意力和无监督/有监督对比学习

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

Motivation: 网络安全领域缺乏统一的框架来定义安全系统的自主能力、评估闭环代理的原则方法以及测量其性能的基准，导致防御系统发展滞后于攻击系统。

Method: 引入CLASP框架，将安全生命周期（侦察、利用、根因分析、补丁合成、验证）与核心自主能力（规划、工具使用、记忆、推理、反思与感知）对齐，并定义CLC评分来量化闭环程度和操作有效性。

Result: 应用CLASP分析了21个代表性工作，识别了系统的优势领域和持续存在的能力差距，提供了评估自主安全代理的通用词汇和标准。

Conclusion: CLASP框架和CLC评分为推进功能级性能和测量闭环安全代理提供了必要的词汇、诊断工具和测量方法，有助于加速自主安全系统的发展。

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

Motivation: 多模态对话摘要需要有效的自动评估方法来降低成本，但缺乏基于人工标注的强健元评估基准。

Method: 构建MDSEval基准，包含图像分享对话和对应摘要，提出基于模态间互斥关键信息（MEKI）的过滤框架来确保数据质量，并首次形式化定义了MDS特有的关键评估维度。

Result: 对最先进的模态评估方法进行基准测试，发现它们在区分先进MLLM生成的摘要方面存在局限性，且容易受到各种偏见影响。

Conclusion: MDSEval为多模态对话摘要评估提供了首个元评估基准，揭示了现有评估方法的不足，为开发更有效的MDS评估方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

TL;DR: FOR-Prompting是一种非对称推理协议，通过Defender提出答案、Objectioner提出质疑、Host确保一致性的角色结构，实现自我修正和推理改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理协议（如CoT、ToT）缺乏外部质疑机制来引发自我修正，需要一种能够通过提问式质疑促进推理改进的方法。

Method: 采用三角色协议：Defender提出初始答案，Objectioner提出质疑但不直接修复，Host确保对话一致性和结束。纯提示级别操作，无需重新训练。

Result: 在GSM8K上比单提示提升约22%，与CoT准确率相当，推理和连贯性评分高10%以上；小模型（Llama3.2:1b）准确率提升约19%；可无工具纠正错误。

Conclusion: FOR-Prompting是模型无关的协议，通过角色结构化对话实现质疑引导的推理，适用于不同规模模型，支持大规模研究。

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

Method: 使用logit lens分析残差流激活，识别模型在处理g(f(x))组合任务时的两种处理机制：组合式机制（计算中间变量f(x)）和直接式机制（不检测到中间变量）。

Result: 确认LLMs存在组合性差距，识别出两种不同的处理机制，发现机制选择与嵌入空间几何相关，当存在从x到g(f(x))的线性映射时，直接式机制占主导。

Conclusion: LLMs在解决组合任务时并非总是使用组合机制，而是根据嵌入空间几何选择不同的处理策略，这揭示了模型内部工作机制的复杂性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解决医疗预咨询对话中格式惯性问题的方法，通过重新平衡训练数据的轮次分布来改善LLMs在长对话中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗预咨询等任务中，SFT数据集通常存在轮次分布不均的问题，导致模型在长对话中产生重复、格式正确但诊断信息不足的问题，即格式惯性。

Method: 采用简单的数据中心化方法，重新平衡训练数据集的轮次分布。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著减轻了医疗预咨询中的格式惯性问题。

Conclusion: 通过重新平衡训练数据的轮次分布，可以有效缓解LLMs在医疗预咨询长对话中出现的格式惯性问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

TL;DR: MathLens是一个新的多模态推理基准测试，专门用于分解几何问题中的感知、推理和整合三个子技能，揭示不同训练方法对各子技能的差异化影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型的评估主要依赖总体准确率，这种单一评分掩盖了模型在哪些方面以及如何改进的细节。需要更细粒度的评估方法来理解模型在不同子技能上的表现。

Method: 设计MathLens基准测试，将几何问题分解为感知、推理和整合三个组件，并提供视觉图表、文本描述、控制问题和感知探针等标注，所有内容都来自问题的符号化规范以确保一致性。

Result: 分析发现：强化学习主要增强感知能力；推理能力只能与感知能力同步提升；整合能力是最弱的环节；不同训练方法在鲁棒性上表现不同，RL提高了一致性而多模态SFT降低了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多模态推理模型在不同子技能上的进步是不均衡的，需要针对性的训练方法来提升特定能力，特别是整合能力需要专门关注。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

TL;DR: 将工程设计标准中的信息转化为模块化、可重用、机器可解释的本体，并在工厂设计和设备选择过程中用于质量保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程设计中技术规范和标准仍以文档为中心，需要数字化工业工作。

Method: 使用建模模式创建模块化本体，基于国际管道、材料和阀门设计标准，采用W3C兼容格式存储，并与ISO DIS 23726-3工业数据本体对齐。

Result: 在阀门选择过程中测试本体，能够自动验证特定阀门数据表是否符合相关行业标准，通过语义推理和可执行设计规则确定产品类型是否满足阀门规范。

Conclusion: 创建基于IDO的共享、可重用模块化设计标准本体，使语义推理能够应用于设备选择过程，展示了向数字化智能标准过渡的潜力。

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Refusal Index (RI)指标，用于准确衡量LLM对超出其知识范围问题的拒绝能力，解决了现有指标在测量知识感知拒绝能力方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标无法准确测量LLM的知识感知拒绝能力：简单拒绝率指标受拒绝倾向影响，校准指标是代理指标而非实际拒绝行为。需要开发能准确量化LLM内在拒绝能力的指标。

Method: 提出Refusal Index (RI)，定义为拒绝概率与错误概率之间的Spearman秩相关系数。设计了轻量级两轮评估方法，通过两次标准评估运行中的观察拒绝率来有效估计RI。

Result: 在16个模型和5个数据集上的实验表明，RI能准确量化模型在事实任务中的内在知识感知拒绝能力。RI在不同拒绝率下保持稳定，提供与模型整体准确率和拒绝率无关的一致模型排名。

Conclusion: RI揭示了LLM事实性的重要但被忽视的方面：虽然LLM在事实任务中达到高准确率，但其拒绝行为可能不可靠且脆弱。需要将传统准确率指标与Refusal Index结合进行全面的真实性评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了16种无监督指标在从俄罗斯司法判决中提取语义块的质量，发现词频连贯性和覆盖率比等指标与专家评分最一致，而法律术语密度呈负相关。LLM评估得分表现中等，表明无监督指标可扩展但不能完全替代法律领域的人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律自然语言处理的快速发展需要可扩展的方法来评估从司法判决中提取文本的质量，特别是在缺乏预标注真实标签的情况下。

Method: 使用16种无监督指标评估从1000份匿名俄罗斯司法判决中提取7个语义块的质量，包括文档级、语义、结构、伪真实标签和法律特定类别指标，并与7168个专家评分（1-5李克特量表）进行验证。

Result: 词频连贯性（Pearson r=0.540）和覆盖率比/块完整性（Pearson r=0.513）与专家评分最一致，法律术语密度呈强负相关（Pearson r=-0.479）。LLM评估得分表现中等（Pearson r=0.382）。

Conclusion: 无监督指标包括LLM方法可实现可扩展筛选，但由于中等相关性和低一致性系数，在高风险法律环境中不能完全替代人类判断。这项工作通过提供无需标注的评估工具推进了法律NLP发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

Motivation: 大型语言模型能够生成高度逼真的垃圾评论，对现有检测系统构成威胁，需要开发新的检测方法。

Method: 提出FraudSquad混合检测模型，集成预训练语言模型的文本嵌入和门控图变换器，捕捉语义和行为特征。

Result: 在三个LLM生成的垃圾评论数据集上，FraudSquad比现有最佳方法在精确率和召回率上分别提升44.22%和43.01%。

Conclusion: FraudSquad提供了一种实用解决方案，强调了在LLM时代适应垃圾评论检测的紧迫性。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在数学问题解决中存在语法盲点，即使语义简单但表述陌生的题目也会出错。通过使用正确示例的语法模板重述问题，可以显著提高正确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs在数学推理中存在系统性失败模式：当问题表述偏离训练分布时，即使语义简单，模型也会错误应用熟悉的推理策略。

Method: 使用从正确示例中提取的语法模板重述错误回答的问题，保持语义不变但降低结构复杂度。使用依存局部性理论(DLT)量化语法复杂度。

Result: 重述后的问题正确率显著提高，更高的DLT分数与更高的失败率相关。这表明错误源于结构错位而非概念困难。

Conclusion: LLMs的许多推理错误源于结构对齐问题而非概念理解不足，语法感知干预可以揭示和缓解这些归纳失败。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

Motivation: 网页中的半结构化内容（HTML表格、列表、信息框）包含大量事实数据，但格式复杂难以使用，现有方法要么缺乏泛化能力，要么因每页LLM推理而资源密集。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，利用网站内网页布局相似性作为奖励信号，生成可重用的提取脚本，并通过在CommonCrawl数据上进行迭代训练来改进。

Result: 在脚本质量上比强基线高出13%以上，GPT-4o的下游问答准确率提升超过4%，实现了可扩展且资源高效的网页信息提取。

Conclusion: SCRIBES通过生成可重用的提取脚本，实现了对半结构化网页内容的高效、可扩展提取，显著提升了信息提取的质量和效率。

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

Result: 多模态模型在BabyLM基准测试中表现优于之前的基线，但在关注语法的纯语言基准测试中表现不佳，模型融合方法能在一定程度上缓解这个问题，同时保持多模态性能。

Conclusion: 多模态模型确实在纯语言任务中表现不佳，特别是语法相关任务，但通过与纯语言模型进行参数融合，可以在保持多模态性能的同时部分改善语言能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

Result: 实验显示REPAIR在多个模型家族中将编辑准确率提高了10%-30%，并显著减少了知识遗忘。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发可靠、可扩展且持续演化的LLM提供了一个稳健框架。

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning

multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic
introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM

Conclusion: ILM为构建更鲁棒、基础更牢固、更可控和可信的下一代LLMs提供了基础框架。

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and
underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote
adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to
input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by
inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,
potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation
LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 在线强化学习对于精确和可信的声明验证非常有效，为未来研究提供了基础，并发布了代码支持社区进展。

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型可以通过多维度主观标注（情感、情绪、论证、主题）来预测个体的价值解释，所有维度同时使用效果最佳，超越单一维度和无个体信息的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 价值概念的解释受社会文化背景和生活经历影响，具有主观性。为了让AI系统能够与多样化的人类视角对齐并避免偏向多数观点，需要识别个体的价值解释。

Method: 使用SEAT维度（情感、情绪、论证、主题）作为个体解释视角的代理，在不同零样本和少样本设置下评估语言模型预测个体价值解释的能力。

Result: 同时提供所有SEAT维度时性能最佳，优于单一维度和无个体信息的基线。不同标注者之间存在个体差异，强调了考虑个体主观标注的重要性。

Conclusion: 这是首个超越人口统计特征、研究标注行为对价值预测影响的受控实验，为未来大规模验证提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

*Ryosuke Kohita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究数据库模式规范化对NL2SQL系统性能的影响，发现非规范化模式在简单查询中表现更好，而规范化模式在聚合查询中更优，最佳模式设计取决于查询类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数现有研究在固定模式上评估NL2SQL模型，忽视了模式设计对性能的影响。本文旨在填补这一空白，系统研究模式规范化程度对NL2SQL性能的影响。

Method: 评估八个领先的大语言模型，使用具有不同规范化程度的合成和真实数据集，包括形式化规范化(1NF-3NF)的合成数据集和实际学术论文数据集。

Result: 非规范化模式在简单检索查询中准确率高，即使使用零样本设置的成本效益模型；规范化模式(2NF/3NF)在基础表选择和连接类型预测方面存在挑战，但通过提供少量样本可显著缓解；对于聚合查询，规范化模式表现更好，因其能避免数据重复和NULL值问题。

Conclusion: NL2SQL应用的最佳模式设计取决于支持的查询类型，开发NL2SQL接口时应考虑模式设计，并为实际场景集成自适应模式选择。

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个多任务孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BanglaMultiHate，并通过系统实验比较了传统方法、单语预训练模型和LLM在低资源环境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语等低资源语言缺乏有效的仇恨言论检测工具，现有研究多为单任务且覆盖范围有限，需要更全面的多维度检测系统。

Method: 创建大规模人工标注数据集BanglaMultiHate，系统比较传统基线方法、单语预训练模型和LLM在零样本提示和LoRA微调下的表现。

Result: LoRA微调的LLM与BanglaBERT性能相当，但文化和语言相关的预训练对于稳健性能仍然至关重要。

Conclusion: 数据集和发现为低资源环境下开发文化对齐的审核工具建立了更强基准，强调了文化和语言基础预训练的重要性。

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

TL;DR: 该研究从过程导向角度评估大语言模型的创造力，引入基于约束的决策作为作者创造力的分析视角，发现LLMs在创作中一致性地优先考虑风格而非其他元素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型创造力评估主要关注输出质量而非创作过程，本研究旨在通过叙事学视角将LLMs视为计算作者，分析其创作偏好和决策过程。

Method: 使用受控提示分配作者角色，分析模型的创作偏好，并探究模型选择背后的推理过程。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在创作中一致性地优先强调风格元素，而非角色、事件和场景等其他要素，不同模型展现出独特的创作偏好特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析AI作者创造力提供了一个新颖的系统性工具，能够揭示不同模型在创作过程中的独特偏好特征。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

TL;DR: 提出了Streaming RAG框架，通过在用户说话时并行预测工具查询来降低端到端语音对话系统的延迟，提高问答准确性和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音对话系统容易产生幻觉且缺乏事实基础，传统文本对话系统的工具集成方法无法直接应用于语音系统，且工具集成会增加响应延迟。

Method: 开发了后训练流程，教导模型在持续语音中何时发出工具调用，以及如何生成融合音频查询和检索文本结果的语音摘要。构建了AudioCRAG基准数据集进行评估。

Result: 流式RAG方法将QA准确率相对提高了200%（从11.1%提升到34.2%），并将工具使用延迟降低了20%。

Conclusion: 流式RAG方法显著提高了语音对话系统的准确性和响应速度，且该方法与模态无关，可应用于文本输入，为更智能的实时AI助手铺平了道路。

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

TL;DR: 提出SCoT框架，通过流式思维链方法改进双工语音对话系统，在保持低延迟的同时提升语义推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音活动检测无法区分停顿和对话结束，现有双工系统架构复杂且语义推理能力落后于级联模型

Method: 采用流式思维链框架，交替处理固定时长的用户输入并以分块方式生成响应，使用帧级对齐创建中间目标

Result: 相比现有双工方法产生更连贯和可解释的响应，同时支持比逐轮系统更低的延迟和重叠交互

Conclusion: SCoT框架成功解决了双工语音对话系统在语义推理和架构复杂性方面的挑战

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码已成为系统减少大语言模型解码时间的标准技术，但现有研究未关注其在不同任务间速度提升的差异性，特别是对欠拟合和代表性不足任务的影响。

Method: 通过分析框架量化推测解码的不公平性，识别导致差异速度提升的因素，并设计缓解策略来减少速度提升差异。

Result: 研究发现推测解码的速度提升在不同任务间分布不均，对欠拟合任务效果较差。提出的缓解策略在多个模型对上验证，公平性指标平均提升12%。

Conclusion: 推测解码存在任务间不公平的速度提升问题，需要专门设计策略来确保更公平的性能分布。

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

TL;DR: RESTRAIN是一种自约束强化学习框架，通过自惩罚机制将无标签数据转化为有用的学习信号，无需人工标注即可提升推理模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于人工标注数据的强化学习方法成本高昂且在复杂任务上表现不佳，需要一种能够利用无标签数据进行持续自我改进的方法。

Method: 利用模型整个答案分布中的信号：惩罚过度自信的推理路径和低一致性示例，同时保留有前景的推理链，可无缝集成到GRPO等策略优化方法中。

Result: 在AIME25上Pass@1提升高达+140.7%，在MMLU_STEM上提升+36.2%，在GPQA-Diamond上提升+19.6%，几乎达到有标签训练的效果但无需任何黄金标签。

Conclusion: RESTRAIN为无需黄金标签实现更强推理能力提供了一条可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生幻觉内容，现有方法多将幻觉检测视为二元任务，但实际应用需要识别幻觉跨度，这是一个多步骤决策过程，需要显式推理。

Method: 提出RL4HS强化学习框架，基于Group Relative Policy Optimization，引入Class-Aware Policy Optimization解决奖励不平衡问题，使用跨度级奖励函数激励推理。

Result: 在RAGTruth基准测试（摘要、问答、数据到文本）上，RL4HS超越了预训练推理模型和监督微调方法。

Conclusion: 强化学习结合跨度级奖励对于检测幻觉跨度是必要的，显式推理能够提升幻觉检测性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

Motivation: 降低非计算机专业人士使用知识图谱的门槛，因为SPARQL查询语言学习曲线陡峭，大语言模型可以提供Text2SPARQL翻译支持

Method: 基于SPINACH的LLM代理，采用迭代式探索和执行过程进行自然语言到SPARQL的翻译，而非单次转换

Result: 描述了整体架构和设计决策原理，并对代理行为进行了深入分析以识别未来改进方向

Conclusion: 该工作为Text2SPARQL领域提供了改进方向，通过迭代方法提高了翻译质量

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the
Text2SPARQL domain.

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法主要依赖自探索或单一教师模型来引导长链推理，这会引入模型内在偏见并限制探索，从而影响推理多样性和性能。

Method: AMPO框架自适应地利用多个熟练教师模型的指导，但仅在策略模型无法生成正确解决方案时提供指导。采用基于理解的筛选机制，让学生从最可能理解的推理路径中学习。

Result: AMPO显著优于GRPO基线，在数学推理任务上提升4.3%，在分布外任务上提升12.2%，同时显著提升Pass@k性能并实现更多样化的探索。使用四个同等规模教师，能达到与使用单一更强大教师方法相当的结果。

Conclusion: AMPO展示了一条更高效和可扩展的路径，能够实现卓越的推理能力和泛化性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X

well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been
developed around the English language, and methods for detecting
Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the

BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM
with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Token Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA)指标和Cumulative Entropy Regulation (CER)机制，通过Explore Briefly, Then Decide范式解决LLMs在简单问题上过度思考的问题，显著减少推理长度而不影响性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂问题上表现出色，但在简单问题上往往过度思考，生成不必要的冗长推理步骤，影响效率且难以根据问题复杂度自适应调整推理深度。

Method: 引入TECA指标衡量推理过程中的探索程度，提出CER机制和Explore Briefly, Then Decide推理范式，动态确定结束思考的最佳时机。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，该方法显著缓解了过度思考问题，平均响应长度在简单数据集上最多减少71%，同时保持问题解决能力。

Conclusion: 该方法创建了更高效和自适应的推理过程，解决了LLMs在简单问题上过度思考的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了InfoMosaic-Bench，这是首个专注于工具增强代理中多源信息寻求的基准测试，涵盖六个代表性领域，要求代理结合通用搜索与领域特定工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理严重依赖开放网络搜索，存在两个根本弱点：在线内容嘈杂不可靠，许多现实任务需要精确的领域特定知识。MCP协议的出现允许代理与数千个专业工具交互，但尚不清楚代理是否能有效利用这些工具并与通用搜索结合解决复杂任务。

Method: 使用InfoMosaic-Flow合成任务，这是一个可扩展的流水线，将任务条件基于已验证的工具输出，强制执行跨源依赖关系，并过滤掉可通过简单查找解决的捷径情况。

Result: 对14个最先进LLM代理的实验显示：仅使用网络信息不足（GPT-5准确率38.2%，通过率67.5%）；领域工具提供选择性但不一致的益处；22.4%的失败源于工具使用或选择错误。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在基本工具处理方面仍存在困难，需要开发能够有效整合多源信息的更智能代理。

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注RL推理在任务或模态间的泛化，而本研究从跨语言角度探讨推理泛化，检验英语RPT获得的推理能力是否适用于其他语言。

Method: 系统评估英语中心大模型在多语言推理基准上的表现，引入量化跨语言迁移性的指标，并通过干预研究和并行训练实验进行分析。

Result: 发现跨语言迁移性差异显著，强英语能力模型过度依赖英语模式导致跨语言泛化减弱；并行训练带来性能跃升，跨语言推理迁移遵循幂律规律，存在单语泛化差距。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了LRM推理模拟人类认知的假设，为开发更语言无关的大模型提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

changing the core logic.
  The toolkit integrates easily with various interpretability and analysis
methods. We demonstrate its usage with two simple analytical experiments,
revealing systematic differences in the hidden representations of VLMs across
layers and target concepts. VLM-Lens is released as an open-sourced project to
accelerate community efforts in understanding and improving VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM竞技场评估将平局视为模型实力相当，但作者认为平局可能更多反映查询难度而非模型能力差异，需要重新审视这种处理方式。

Method: 通过分析三个真实世界竞技场数据集，研究忽略平局评分更新对战斗结果预测准确性的影响，并分析平局与查询难度、客观性的关联。

Result: 忽略平局评分更新使四个评分系统的战斗结果预测准确率相对提升1-3%，平局更易出现在非常容易和高度客观的查询中，风险比分别为1.37和1.35。

Conclusion: 建议未来评分系统重新考虑现有平局语义，并在评分更新中考虑查询属性，以更准确反映模型真实能力。

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

Method: 通过专家手动设计和基于代理的可扩展合成来构建数据集，创建基于真实软件开发过程的生态有效场景，并引入正确性、效率和冗余度等评估指标。

Result: 对最先进LLM和记忆后端的实验显示，在长时程利用记忆、处理跨平台依赖和解决矛盾方面存在挑战，表现最佳的GPT-5模型在MEMTRACK上仅达到60%的正确性得分。

Conclusion: 这项工作为记忆增强代理的评估研究提供了一个可扩展框架，超越了现有对话设置的关注，为复杂组织环境中的多代理、多平台记忆基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

TL;DR: 提出了TRACE方法来检测隐式奖励黑客行为，通过截断思维链测量模型通过验证器所需的最小努力，从而识别利用漏洞的捷径行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励黑客行为（模型利用奖励函数漏洞获得高分但不解决实际任务）是一个严重威胁，特别是隐式黑客行为会绕过思维链监控器。

Method: TRACE方法通过逐步截断模型的思维链，强制模型在不同截断点回答，测量每个截断长度下通过验证器的比例，计算准确率-长度曲线下的面积来量化模型努力程度。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，TRACE比最强的72B思维链监控器提升超过65%；在编码任务中，比32B监控器提升超过30%。还能在训练中发现未知漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种可扩展的无监督监督方法，在当前监控方法无效的情况下有效检测隐式奖励黑客行为。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在多步任务中经常失败，而检索增强生成虽然能改善性能但需要维护外部知识库并增加计算开销

Method: 从代理失败中提取紧凑可重用提示，使用这些提示通过一次性检索生成改进的教师轨迹，然后在移除提示字符串的情况下训练学生模型

Result: 在ALFWorld上达到91%成功率（基线为79%），WebShop得分提升至72（基线为61），同时比检索增强教师少用10-60%的token

Conclusion: 检索优势可以通过针对性微调有效内化，无需永久运行时依赖，该方法在不同模型规模和代理架构上都具有通用性

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VOGUE是一种新颖的强化学习方法，通过将探索从文本输出空间转移到视觉输入空间，利用视觉不确定性来指导多模态大语言模型的探索过程，显著提升了推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在处理多模态大语言模型时，将视觉输入视为固定确定性条件，忽略了视觉变化带来的模糊性，导致策略对合理视觉变化的鲁棒性不足。

Method: VOGUE将图像视为随机上下文，通过计算原始分支和噪声分支之间的对称KL散度来量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，创建不确定性感知的探索信号。该方法结合不确定性比例奖励、token熵奖励和退火采样调度，有效平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B模型上，VOGUE在三个视觉数学基准测试中平均提升pass@1准确率2.6%，在三个通用领域推理基准测试中提升3.7%，同时提高了pass@4性能并缓解了RL微调中常见的探索衰减问题。

Conclusion: 基于视觉输入固有不确定性的探索策略是提升多模态推理的有效方法，VOGUE通过将探索重点从输出转移到输入空间，显著改善了多模态大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM规划代理虽然解决了观测不确定性，但往往忽略了内部动态与实际环境之间的差异，需要主动信息寻求来对齐内部动态。

Method: 通过提示LLM主动收集信息来验证理解、检测环境变化或测试假设，然后生成或修订任务导向计划。

Result: 在部分可观测环境基准测试中，InfoSeeker比现有方法性能提升74%，且在机器人操作和网页导航等基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 在部分可观测环境中，紧密集成规划与信息寻求对于实现鲁棒行为至关重要。

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

TL;DR: InvThink是一种通过逆向思维让大语言模型在生成回复前先分析潜在风险的方法，相比现有安全对齐方法能更有效地减少有害回复，同时保持通用推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法直接优化安全回复，但可能影响模型的通用能力。作者希望通过逆向思维方法，让模型在生成前系统性地考虑失败模式，实现更好的安全性和能力平衡。

Method: 1) 枚举潜在危害 2) 分析后果 3) 生成主动避免这些风险的安全输出。通过监督微调和强化学习在三个LLM家族中实现。

Result: 在模型规模扩大时安全改进效果更强；减少安全税，保持标准基准上的通用推理能力；在高风险领域（医疗、金融、法律等）和智能体场景中，相比SafetyPrompt等方法减少高达15.7%的有害回复。

Conclusion: 逆向推理为构建更安全、更强大的语言模型提供了一条可扩展和泛化的路径。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

*Min Zeng*

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在心理咨询领域的应用潜力，通过开发PsychoBench基准测试来评估LLMs是否具备通过美国国家咨询师认证考试的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在多个行业展现出强大生成能力，但在需要认知能力的心理咨询应用方面仍有待探索。本文旨在评估LLMs是否具备担任心理咨询师所需的专业知识和资质。

Method: 开发了PsychoBench基准测试，基于美国国家咨询师考试构建，包含约2,252个精心设计的单选题，涵盖心理学各子学科，要求深度理解和广泛知识。

Result: 评估显示先进模型如GPT-4o、Llama3.3-70B和Gemma3-27B远超通过阈值（约70%准确率），而较小的开源模型（如Qwen2.5-7B、Mistral-7B）远低于此标准。

Conclusion: 只有前沿LLMs目前能够达到心理咨询考试标准，这凸显了开发心理学导向LLMs的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文识别了计算机使用代理(CUAs)中的盲目目标导向(BGD)风险，开发了BLIND-ACT基准测试，评估了9个前沿模型，发现平均80.8%的BGD率，揭示了即使输入无害时也会出现的微妙风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理在GUI上执行操作以实现用户目标，但存在盲目追求目标而忽视可行性、安全性和上下文的系统性偏差，需要识别和量化这种风险。

Method: 开发BLIND-ACT基准测试，包含90个任务捕捉BGD的三种模式：缺乏上下文推理、在模糊性下做假设和决策、矛盾或不可行目标。基于OSWorld构建真实环境，使用LLM评估代理行为。

Result: 评估9个前沿模型发现平均BGD率为80.8%，提示干预能降低BGD水平但风险依然显著。观察到执行优先偏见、思维-行动脱节和请求优先等失败模式。

Conclusion: 识别BGD和引入BLIND-ACT为研究和减轻这一基本风险奠定了基础，需要更强的训练或推理时干预来确保CUA的安全部署。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估方法主要依赖基于人类对智能直觉设计的合成任务，这些方法在AI历史上表现不佳，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 提出基于稳健任务执行能力的AGI评估框架，借鉴数据科学中验证系统可靠部署的实践方法，提供具体评估示例。

Result: 论证了基于直觉的合成任务评估方法的局限性，提出了更实用的基于能力证明的评估替代方案。

Conclusion: AGI评估应转向关注系统在真实环境中稳健执行任务的能力，而非依赖人工设计的合成测试，这能提供更可靠的AGI进展指标。

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了PTA-GRPO框架，通过两阶段方法改进LLM的推理能力：第一阶段使用高级LLM将思维链提炼为紧凑的高层指导进行监督微调；第二阶段引入指导感知的强化学习方法联合优化最终输出和高层指导质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的推理过程受限于自回归的token级生成，缺乏全局规划，导致推理冗余、不连贯或不准确。现有方法如树基算法和RL计算成本高且难以产生最优推理轨迹。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用高级LLM将CoT提炼为高层指导进行SFT；2) 引入指导感知RL方法联合优化最终输出和指导质量。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，包括MATH、AIME2024、AIME2025和AMC，使用不同基础模型均实现了稳定且显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO方法能有效提升LLM的推理能力，在不同模型和任务上都具有良好的泛化性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

TL;DR: 提出CARS方法，通过自适应剪枝提高受限生成的采样效率，同时保持语言模型分布不变形


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有受限生成方法存在两难：贪婪解码会扭曲LM分布，而拒绝采样计算效率低下。在程序模糊测试等领域，既需要样本有效性又需要多样性

Method: CARS从无约束LM采样开始，自适应地排除违反约束的后续序列，通过trie记录并减去其概率质量，确保无效前缀不会被重复访问

Result: 在程序模糊测试和分子生成等实验中，CARS在每有效样本的LM前向传递次数上效率更高，同时产生比GCD和其他方法更强的样本多样性

Conclusion: CARS严格提高了拒绝采样的效率而不扭曲分布，在多种领域都实现了更高的效率和多样性

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

TL;DR: 虽然AI模型在文本模态的ConceptARC基准上能达到人类水平的准确率，但其生成的规则往往依赖表面模式而非真正的抽象推理，而在视觉模态中准确率下降但仍有相当比例的规则体现了抽象推理能力。仅凭准确率评估会高估文本模态的抽象推理能力，低估视觉模态的抽象推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估AI模型是否真正具备抽象推理能力，而非仅仅依赖表面模式在ARC-AGI等基准上获得高准确率。作者质疑当前最先进模型是否真正识别和使用了任务设计者预期的抽象概念。

Method: 在ConceptARC基准上进行多模态评估，比较文本和视觉输入，允许使用外部Python工具，对推理模型评估不同推理努力程度。除了输出准确率，还精细评估模型生成的自然语言解释规则。

Result: 文本模态下模型准确率可达人类水平，但规则分析显示大多依赖表面"捷径"而非预期抽象概念；视觉模态下准确率显著下降，但规则分析显示模型仍能生成相当比例的抽象规则，只是无法正确应用。

Conclusion: 模型在抽象推理方面仍落后于人类，仅凭准确率评估会误导对模型抽象推理能力的判断。提出的评估框架能更真实地反映多模态模型的抽象推理能力，为追踪类人抽象智能提供更原则性的方法。

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

Result: 实验证实主流DRAs在性能上优于基于网络搜索工具增强的推理模型，但仍存在显著的改进空间。

Conclusion: 该研究为DRA系统的能力评估、架构优化和范式发展提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

Motivation: 研究RLVR方法在提升语言模型推理能力时出现的边界缩小问题，探索其失败原因并寻求改进方案。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究揭示RLVR中的负干扰和赢家通吃现象，提出专注于低概率问题的数据筛选算法。

Result: 发现RLVR会导致某些训练问题的学习降低其他问题的正确解概率，且过度强化高概率问题而抑制低概率问题，提出的数据筛选算法显著改善了Pass@k性能。

Conclusion: RLVR的失败源于标准强化学习目标中的策略采样，导致模型收敛到狭窄的解策略，通过专注于低概率问题的学习可以有效缓解这一问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

Motivation: 计算机使用代理在自动化日常数字任务方面具有潜力，但其不可靠性和高方差阻碍了在长期复杂任务中的应用。

Method: bBoN方法通过生成多个代理执行轨迹，并使用描述代理行为轨迹的叙述来进行选择，实现广泛探索和原则性轨迹选择。

Result: 在OSWorld上达到69.9%的最新最先进水平，显著超越先前方法，接近人类72%的表现水平，并在WindowsAgentArena和AndroidWorld上展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，当采用结构化轨迹理解和选择时，扩展计算机使用代理具有显著效果，bBoN为实现这一目标提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为RLAD的两玩家强化学习训练范式，通过推理抽象来引导模型进行更有效的推理，解决了现有模型在推理过程中缺乏程序复用和结构化探索的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型模型在推理过程中往往只是进行冗长的探索，而无法一致地捕捉或复用程序性知识，导致推理效率低下。需要一种能够引导模型学习成功推理的方法。

Method: 引入推理抽象的概念，训练模型能够针对问题提出多个抽象描述，然后使用强化学习激励模型基于这些抽象信息构建解决方案。采用两玩家RL训练范式，联合训练抽象生成器和解决方案生成器。

Result: 该方法实现了结构化探索，解耦了抽象提议和解决方案生成的学习信号，并提高了对更困难问题的泛化能力。测试时分配更多计算资源生成抽象比生成更多解决方案更有利于性能提升。

Conclusion: 推理抽象能够有效引导有意义的探索，RLAD训练范式显著提升了模型的推理能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

*Stephen Meisenbacher,Svetlozar Nestorov,Peter Norlander*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 开发了Job Ad Analysis Toolkit (JAAT)，一个从在线招聘广告中提取结构化信息的开源自然语言处理工具包，基于O*NET框架，处理了超过1.55亿个招聘广告，提取了100亿+数据点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线招聘数据难以获取且缺乏标准化，而标准的O*NET数据库更新不频繁且样本量小，需要更有效的方法来提取和分析招聘市场信息。

Method: 采用O*NET作为框架，开发JAAT工具包，使用自然语言处理技术从招聘广告中提取结构化信息，包括任务、职业代码、工具技术、工资、技能等特征。

Result: 从1.55亿个招聘广告中提取了100亿+数据点，构建了2015-2025年按职业、州和行业聚合的月度活跃工作数据集，验证了工具的可靠性和准确性。

Conclusion: JAAT工具包为研究和教育、劳动力发展提供了有价值的数据资源，展示了从大规模招聘数据中提取结构化信息的潜力。

Abstract: Data from online job postings are difficult to access and are not built in a
standard or transparent manner. Data included in the standard taxonomy and
occupational information database (O*NET) are updated infrequently and based on
small survey samples. We adopt O*NET as a framework for building natural
language processing tools that extract structured information from job
postings. We publish the Job Ad Analysis Toolkit (JAAT), a collection of
open-source tools built for this purpose, and demonstrate its reliability and
accuracy in out-of-sample and LLM-as-a-Judge testing. We extract more than 10
billion data points from more than 155 million online job ads provided by the
National Labor Exchange (NLx) Research Hub, including O*NET tasks, occupation
codes, tools, and technologies, as well as wages, skills, industry, and more
features. We describe the construction of a dataset of occupation, state, and
industry level features aggregated by monthly active jobs from 2015 - 2025. We
illustrate the potential for research and future uses in education and
workforce development.

### [112] [Jailbreaking LLMs via Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with Targeted Toxic Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01223)
*Hui Dou,Ning Xu,Yiwen Zhang,Kaibin Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: RTS-Attack是一种针对大语言模型对齐防御的自动化攻击框架，通过构建与查询高度语义相关的嵌套场景并整合针对性有害知识，成功绕过LLMs的安全防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌套场景攻击方法由于恶意意图明显而容易被检测，研究发现LLMs的对齐防御对语义相关且包含针对性有害知识的嵌套场景不敏感，这是一个重要但未被充分探索的方向。

Method: 提出RTS-Attack框架，通过构建与查询高度语义相关的嵌套场景，并整合针对性有害知识来生成越狱提示，这些提示不包含有害查询，具有出色的隐蔽性。

Result: 在GPT-4o、Llama3-70b和Gemini-pro等多种先进LLMs上的广泛实验表明，RTS-Attack在效率和通用性方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RTS-Attack成功揭示了LLMs对齐防御的漏洞，为评估和改进LLMs安全性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various tasks. However, they remain exposed to jailbreak attacks, eliciting
harmful responses. The nested scenario strategy has been increasingly adopted
across various methods, demonstrating immense potential. Nevertheless, these
methods are easily detectable due to their prominent malicious intentions. In
this work, we are the first to find and systematically verify that LLMs'
alignment defenses are not sensitive to nested scenarios, where these scenarios
are highly semantically relevant to the queries and incorporate targeted toxic
knowledge. This is a crucial yet insufficiently explored direction. Based on
this, we propose RTS-Attack (Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with
Targeted Toxic Knowledge), an adaptive and automated framework to examine LLMs'
alignment. By building scenarios highly relevant to the queries and integrating
targeted toxic knowledge, RTS-Attack bypasses the alignment defenses of LLMs.
Moreover, the jailbreak prompts generated by RTS-Attack are free from harmful
queries, leading to outstanding concealment. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RTS-Attack exhibits superior performance in both efficiency and
universality compared to the baselines across diverse advanced LLMs, including
GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, and Gemini-pro. Our complete code is available in the
supplementary material. WARNING: THIS PAPER CONTAINS POTENTIALLY HARMFUL
CONTENT.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 首个针对Web代理的提示注入攻击检测基准研究，系统评估了文本和图像检测方法，发现现有检测器对无显式指令或不可察觉扰动的攻击效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示注入攻击检测方法缺乏针对Web代理的系统性评估，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含恶意和良性样本的数据集，系统化文本和图像检测方法，并在多种场景下评估性能。

Result: 部分检测器能识别依赖显式文本指令或可见图像扰动的攻击，但对无显式指令或不可察觉扰动的攻击检测效果差。

Conclusion: 需要开发更有效的检测方法来应对复杂的提示注入攻击，特别是那些隐蔽性强的攻击类型。

Abstract: Multiple prompt injection attacks have been proposed against web agents. At
the same time, various methods have been developed to detect general prompt
injection attacks, but none have been systematically evaluated for web agents.
In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first comprehensive
benchmark study on detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents. We
begin by introducing a fine-grained categorization of such attacks based on the
threat model. We then construct datasets containing both malicious and benign
samples: malicious text segments generated by different attacks, benign text
segments from four categories, malicious images produced by attacks, and benign
images from two categories. Next, we systematize both text-based and
image-based detection methods. Finally, we evaluate their performance across
multiple scenarios. Our key findings show that while some detectors can
identify attacks that rely on explicit textual instructions or visible image
perturbations with moderate to high accuracy, they largely fail against attacks
that omit explicit instructions or employ imperceptible perturbations. Our
datasets and code are released at:

### [114] [Position: Privacy Is Not Just Memorization!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01645)
*Niloofar Mireshghallah,Tianshi Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文认为LLM隐私风险不应仅关注训练数据记忆，而应关注数据收集、推理时上下文泄露、自主代理能力和深度推理攻击等更紧迫的威胁，呼吁研究社区采用跨学科方法应对这些社会技术性威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于LLM隐私风险的讨论过度集中于训练数据的逐字记忆，而忽视了更直接和可扩展的隐私威胁，需要重新审视LLM系统的整体隐私格局。

Method: 提出了涵盖LLM全生命周期的隐私风险分类法，通过案例研究分析现有隐私框架的不足，并对2016-2025年间1,322篇AI/ML隐私论文进行纵向分析。

Result: 研究发现记忆问题在技术研究中受到过度关注，而最紧迫的隐私危害存在于其他领域，当前技术方法在这些领域缺乏有效应对方案。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究社区从根本上改变对LLM隐私的认知方式，超越当前技术解决方案的狭隘焦点，采用跨学科方法应对新兴的社会技术性威胁。

Abstract: The discourse on privacy risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
disproportionately focused on verbatim memorization of training data, while a
constellation of more immediate and scalable privacy threats remain
underexplored. This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM
systems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from
data collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent
capabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference
attacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM
lifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through
case studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted
threats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers
published at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal
that while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the
most pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches
offer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear. We call for a
fundamental shift in how the research community approaches LLM privacy, moving
beyond the narrow focus of current technical solutions and embracing
interdisciplinary approaches that address the sociotechnical nature of these
emerging threats.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 提出基于黑板架构的多智能体通信范式，用于解决大型异构数据湖中的数据发现问题，相比传统主从架构具有更好的可扩展性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理大型异构数据湖时存在局限：单智能体系统难以应对大规模数据，而基于主从模式的多智能体系统需要中央控制器精确了解每个子智能体的能力。

Method: 受传统AI模型黑板架构启发，设计中央智能体将请求发布到共享黑板，自主子智能体根据自身能力自愿响应，无需中央协调器事先了解所有子智能体的专业知识。

Result: 在三个需要显式数据发现的基准测试上，黑板架构显著优于基线方法（包括RAG和主从多智能体范式），端到端任务成功率相对提升13%-57%，数据发现的F1分数相对提升最高达9%。

Conclusion: 黑板范式为多智能体系统提供了一个可扩展且可泛化的通信框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new
opportunities in data science, yet their practical deployment is often
constrained by the challenge of discovering relevant data within large
heterogeneous data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: single-agent
systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files in the large data
lakes, while multi-agent systems designed based on a master-slave paradigm
depend on a rigid central controller for task allocation that requires precise
knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard
architecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent
posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents --
either responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information
retrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design
improves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central
coordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate
our method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench
and modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery.
Experimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially
outperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm,
achieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success
and up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the
best-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our
findings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable
communication framework for multi-agent systems.

### [116] [Control the Temperature: Selective Sampling for Diverse and High-Quality LLM Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01218)
*Sergey Troshin,Wafaa Mohammed,Yan Meng,Christof Monz,Antske Fokkens,Vlad Niculae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出选择性采样方法，在数学推理任务中动态切换贪婪采样和高温度采样，以平衡多样性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 温度采样能增加语言模型输出的多样性，但在需要高精度的数学推理任务中，过高的温度会降低推理质量，因为会在敏感解码位置采样到错误继续。

Method: 选择性采样方法：基于采样风险度量动态切换贪婪采样和高温度采样。训练轻量级分类器预测采样风险，可集成到基础语言模型中且延迟开销小。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，选择性采样即使在高温设置下也能改善质量-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: 选择性采样方法有效解决了数学推理任务中温度采样导致的准确性问题，同时保持了输出多样性。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

### [117] [Automated Extraction of Material Properties using LLM-based AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01235)
*Subham Ghosh,Abhishek Tewari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于大语言模型的智能工作流，从约10,000篇科学文献中自主提取热电和结构特性数据，创建了包含27,822条温度分辨记录的数据集，这是目前最大的LLM整理的热电数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 材料快速发现的瓶颈在于缺乏大型、机器可读的性能指标与结构背景耦合的数据集，现有数据库要么规模小、手动整理，要么偏向第一性原理结果，实验文献未被充分利用。

Method: 采用动态令牌分配、零样本多智能体提取和条件表解析的LLM驱动工作流，平衡准确性与计算成本。GPT-4.1和GPT-4.1 Mini在50篇人工整理论文上分别达到F1=0.91/0.82和0.89/0.81的准确率。

Result: 整理了27,822条温度分辨特性记录，包括热电优值、塞贝克系数、电导率、电阻率、功率因子和热导率，以及晶体类别、空间群和掺杂策略等结构属性。数据集分析重现了已知热电趋势并揭示了更广泛的结构-性能关联。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了最大的LLM整理热电数据集，建立了可扩展的数据驱动材料发现基础，并发布了具有语义过滤器、数值查询和CSV导出的交互式网络浏览器。

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

*Zukang Xu,Xing Hu,Qiang Wu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSAVQ是一个新颖的向量量化框架，通过几何驱动的创新方法显著提升LLMs的极低比特量化性能，在2比特量化中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型参数指数增长给资源受限设备部署带来挑战，现有向量量化方法存在无约束方向误差和次优比特分配问题。

Method: 提出RSAVQ框架，包含两个几何驱动创新：1）误差方向敏感度指导（EDSG），利用Fisher信息矩阵诱导的黎曼度量将量化误差投影到参数空间低敏感度方向；2）权重通道敏感度指导（WCSG），通过FIM曲率分析构建通道级敏感度度量来动态指导比特资源分配。

Result: 在LLaMA-3 8B的2比特量化中，RSAVQ在困惑度上领先基线方法VPTQ和QuIP# 0.4，在零样本准确率上领先1.5。

Conclusion: 该工作为受限环境提供了实用解决方案，并在信息几何与神经网络量化之间建立了理论桥梁，推动了高效深度学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

TL;DR: RLP是一种信息驱动的强化预训练目标，将强化学习的探索精神引入预训练阶段，通过奖励思维链提供的信息增益来训练模型独立思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的训练范式只在最后阶段使用强化学习，作者质疑这是否是最优方式，希望将强化学习的核心精神——探索——更早地引入预训练过程。

Method: 将思维链视为探索性动作，基于思维链为预测未来token提供的信息增益计算奖励信号，形成无验证器的密集奖励信号。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B-Base上预训练RLP，在8个数学科学基准上的平均性能提升19%；在Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2上应用后，整体平均从42.81%提升到61.32%，科学推理任务提升23%。

Conclusion: RLP成功将强化学习重新定义为普通文本的预训练目标，弥合了下一个token预测与有用思维链推理之间的差距，在不同架构和模型规模上都展现出良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

TL;DR: 提出基于Pandora's Box问题的推理时优化框架，通过UCB算法实现接近最优的停止策略，在LLM生成中减少15-35%的生成次数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成中输出质量与推理成本之间的平衡问题，特别是在需要多次生成时

Method: 将每次生成视为打开一个代价盒子的Pandora's Box问题，开发UCB风格的算法决定何时停止生成，并通过Bradley-Terry变换处理跨提示的奖励缩放

Result: 在AlpacaFarm和HH-RLHF数据集上的实验表明，自适应策略能达到与Best-of-N采样相同的性能，但平均减少15-35%的生成次数

Conclusion: 在最优停止理论和推理时扩展之间建立了原则性桥梁，为LLM部署提供了理论性能保证和实际效率提升

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Motivation: 受LLM中过度思考现象研究的启发，旨在通过动态选择训练数据来提高RLVR训练效率

Method: LSPO算法，在每个训练步骤基于平均响应长度动态选择训练数据

Result: 在多个基础模型和数据集上验证，LSPO一致提高了学习效果

Conclusion: 通过消融研究提供了将长度信号整合到动态采样中的见解，指出了未来研究方向

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

TL;DR: TRAAC是一种在线后训练强化学习方法，通过自适应压缩推理步骤来解决模型在复杂推理任务中的"欠适应"问题，平衡推理不足和过度推理，提高准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维模型在复杂推理任务中面临"欠适应"问题：推理过短会导致困难问题出错，推理过长则会产生冗余步骤。需要根据任务难度自适应调整推理长度。

Method: 提出TRAAC方法，利用模型在长推理轨迹上的自注意力来识别重要步骤并剪枝冗余步骤，同时估计任务难度并将其纳入训练奖励，学习根据难度分配推理预算。

Result: 在多种任务上，TRAAC相比基础模型平均准确率提升8.4%，推理长度相对减少36.8%；相比最佳RL基线准确率提升7.9%，长度减少29.4%。在分布外非数学数据集上也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TRAAC通过任务难度校准和基于注意力的压缩相结合，能够基于难度进行细粒度的推理预算调整，在多样化任务上实现准确性和效率的提升。

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大型语言模型的后训练中，高监督微调（SFT）分数并不一定能转化为强化学习（RL）后的性能提升，有时甚至会导致更差的结果。作者提出了泛化损失和Pass@large k作为更好的RL结果预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前实践中将SFT和RL作为两个独立阶段的假设，质疑高SFT分数是否能可靠预测RL后的性能提升。

Method: 训练了数百个12B参数模型，使用SFT和基于GRPO的RLVR，在7个数学基准上进行多达256次重复评估，花费超过100万GPU小时。

Result: 发现基于泛化损失和Pass@large k的预测比直接使用预RL性能预测更准确，R²系数和Spearman秩相关系数提高了0.5（2倍）。

Conclusion: SFT性能不是RL结果的可靠预测指标，泛化损失和Pass@large k提供了更好的预测能力，这对实际应用有重要价值。

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: 大规模实证研究表明：单独使用改写式合成数据训练效果不如自然网络文本，但1/3改写合成数据与2/3自然数据混合可加速训练5-10倍；纯教科书式合成数据训练效果较差；最佳合成数据比例约30%；8B参数生成器已足够；改写合成数据未见模型崩溃现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量训练数据有限，合成数据技术可能突破这一限制，但需要实证验证其实际效果和最佳使用方式。

Method: 使用统一协议和缩放定律进行大规模实证研究（>1000个LLM，>10万GPU小时），比较自然网络数据、多种合成数据（改写文本、生成教科书）及其混合。

Result: 改写合成数据单独训练效果不佳，但与自然数据混合可显著加速训练；教科书式合成数据训练效果差；最佳合成数据比例约30%；8B参数生成器足够；改写合成数据未见模型崩溃。

Conclusion: 合成数据在预训练中具有条件性优势，需谨慎使用混合比例，改写式合成数据比纯生成式更安全，为实际应用提供指导。

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

### [125] [Sparse Query Attention (SQA): A Computationally Efficient Attention Mechanism with Query Heads Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01817)
*Adam Filipek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse Query Attention (SQA) 是一种新的注意力架构，通过减少查询头数量来降低计算复杂度，在长序列处理中可实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升，且对模型质量影响很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构中的多头注意力机制存在二次计算复杂度问题，限制了长上下文场景的扩展。现有方法如MQA和GQA虽然解决了内存带宽瓶颈，但未减少注意力分数计算所需的FLOPs。

Method: 提出Sparse Query Attention (SQA)，通过减少查询头数量而非键值头来降低注意力机制的计算复杂度，并提供了理论基础、数学公式和架构变体。

Result: 在32k-200k token的长序列基准测试中，SQA在计算受限场景（如预训练、微调和编码器任务）中可实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升，且初步小规模实验显示对模型质量影响很小。

Conclusion: SQA是一种有效的注意力优化方法，能够构建更高效和可扩展的模型，该架构是在开发Reactive Transformer过程中偶然发现的。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

*Yanxu Chen,Zijun Yao,Yantao Liu,Jin Ye,Jianing Yu,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StockBench是一个无污染基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在真实多个月股票交易环境中的表现，发现大多数LLM代理难以超越简单的买入持有策略，但部分模型显示出更高回报和更好风险管理的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融基准主要通过问答测试静态知识，无法捕捉交易的动态迭代特性，而金融领域对经济价值和高风险决策具有直接相关性，但在这方面仍未被充分探索。

Method: 引入StockBench基准，让代理接收每日市场信号（价格、基本面、新闻），并做出顺序的买入、卖出或持有决策，使用累积回报、最大回撤和索提诺比率等金融指标评估性能。

Result: 评估最先进的专有和开源模型显示，大多数LLM代理难以超越简单买入持有基准，但部分模型显示出提供更高回报和更有效管理风险的潜力。

Conclusion: 在静态金融知识任务表现出色不一定能转化为成功的交易策略，这凸显了开发LLM驱动的金融代理的挑战和机遇。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

TL;DR: 提出了ExGRPO框架，通过识别推理经验的价值指标（正确性和熵），组织并优先处理有价值的经验，使用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用，显著提升了强化学习验证奖励（RLVR）在推理任务中的性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准在线策略训练在单次更新后丢弃经验，导致计算效率低下和不稳定。虽然已有研究强调重用过去经验的好处，但对于大型推理模型学习动态中经验特征的作用仍缺乏深入探索。

Method: 识别推理经验的价值指标（正确性和熵），提出ExGRPO框架，组织并优先处理有价值的经验，采用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用。

Result: 在五个骨干模型（1.5B-8B参数）上，ExGRPO在数学/通用基准测试中持续提升推理性能，相比在线策略RLVR平均提升+3.5/7.6分，并在强弱模型上都能稳定训练。

Conclusion: 原则性经验管理是实现高效可扩展RLVR的关键要素，ExGRPO通过有效利用经验价值指标显著提升了推理性能和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多轮交互设置中仍然容易受到对抗性攻击，现有方法主要依赖人工红队测试或预定义模板，未能充分探索多轮攻击的广阔空间。

Method: 将对话建模为顺序决策问题，结合树搜索的在线策略强化学习框架，无需人工标注数据即可系统性地探索多轮攻击策略。

Result: 在10个目标模型上实现了比现有最先进方法高25.9%以上的攻击成功率，并有效发现了新的攻击策略。

Conclusion: DialTree-RPO能够自主学习最大化多轮攻击成功率的对话策略，为AI安全研究提供了有效的自动化红队测试方法。

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络训练采用固定的优化方案，缺乏对训练不稳定性和突发问题的动态响应能力。

Method: 使用控制服务器作为中介，允许用户或AI代理在训练过程中实时调整超参数、训练数据和模型检查点。

Result: 通过三个案例研究证明，该方法提高了训练稳定性，降低了对初始超参数的敏感性，并增强了适应不断变化的用户需求的能力。

Conclusion: 为未来AI代理自主监控训练日志、主动解决不稳定性和优化训练动态的训练范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,
feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or
automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

Motivation: 解决实时查询自动补全系统中由于模型建议影响用户行为而产生的固有参与信号偏差问题。

Method: 从非自动补全会话的完整查询生成合成前缀，构建多样化训练数据；开发实时神经排序器，包含查询流行度、季节性、模糊匹配分数等丰富特征；引入特定任务的列表损失简化，将计算复杂度从O(n²)降至O(n)。

Conclusion: 合成前缀不仅提高了泛化能力，还为其他低延迟排序任务（如相关搜索和查询推荐）中的偏差缓解提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: We introduce a data-centric approach for mitigating presentation bias in
real-time neural query autocomplete systems through the use of synthetic
prefixes. These prefixes are generated from complete user queries collected
during regular search sessions where autocomplete was not active. This allows
us to enrich the training data for learning to rank models with more diverse
and less biased examples. This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement
signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model
suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for
real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich
set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores,
and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical
alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we
introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing
computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query
autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix.
Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates
statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean
reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes
not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias
mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and
query recommendations.

Result: 该方法在保持基础模型效率的同时添加了最小计算开销，适用于实际部署。

Conclusion: \model{}框架有效解决了LLM推荐系统的关键挑战，实现了动态适应、多模态融合和可信解释的平衡。

Abstract: Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation
tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text
prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising
approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM
representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive
fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several
challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static
snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items
contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current
systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete
evidence. Our work introduces \model{}, a framework that tackles these
limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation
mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through
lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a
unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with
visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be
unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds
recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes,
producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains
the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational
overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Contemporary generative recommendation systems face significant challenges in
handling multimodal data, eliminating algorithmic biases, and providing
transparent decision-making processes. This paper introduces an enhanced
generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through
five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented
generation mechanisms, causal inference-based debiasing, explainable
recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our
framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while
incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual
knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous
model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent
improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to
existing approaches. The proposed framework achieves up to 2.3% improvement in
NDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining
computational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.

Abstract: Promptagator demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot
prompts can be used as task-specific query generators for fine-tuning
domain-specialized dense retrieval models. However, the original Promptagator
approach relied on proprietary and large-scale LLMs which users may not have
access to or may be prohibited from using with sensitive data. In this work, we
study the impact of open-source LLMs at accessible scales ($\leq$14B
parameters) as an alternative. Our results demonstrate that open-source LLMs as
small as 3B parameters can serve as effective Promptagator-style query
generators. We hope our work will inform practitioners with reliable
alternatives for synthetic data generation and give insights to maximize
fine-tuning results for domain-specific applications.
