We introduce TimeStampEval, a benchmark for retrieving precise millisecond timestamps from long transcripts given non-verbatim quotes. Our simple two-stage method dramatically improves retrieval accuracy while cutting inference costs by over 90%. The motivating use case is an automated long-form podcast that assembles Congressional Record clips into AI-hosted narration. The technical challenge: given a sentence-timestamped transcript and a target quote that may differ due to transcription or editorial drift, return exact start and end boundaries. Standard algorithms handle verbatim text but break under fuzzier variants. Evaluating six modern LLMs on a 2,800-sentence (120k-token) transcript revealed four key findings. (1) Prompt design matters more than model choice: placing the query before the transcript and using compact formatting improved accuracy by 3-20 points while reducing token count by 30-40%. (2) Off-by-one errors form a distinct category, showing models understand the task but misplace boundaries. (3) A modest reasoning budget (600-850 tokens) raises accuracy from 37% to 77% for weak setups and to above 90% for strong ones. (4) Our \"Assisted Fuzzy\" approach-RapidFuzz pre-filtering followed by LLM verification on short snippets-improves fuzzy match accuracy by up to 50 points while halving latency and reducing cost per correct result by up to 96%. Extended tests on ten transcripts (50k-900k tokens, 1989-2025) confirm robustness to transcript length, vocabulary drift, and domain change, maintaining 95-100% rejection accuracy for absent targets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TimeStampEval\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u957f\u6587\u672c\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u975e\u9010\u5b57\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u7cca\u5339\u914d\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u540c\u4f46\u53e5\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f15\u7528\u65f6\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b98\u65b9\u4e66\u9762\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6587\u672c\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528RapidFuzz\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u5728\u77ed\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u8fd8\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6a21\u7cca\u5339\u914d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8650\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u534a\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6b63\u786e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8696%\u3002\u5728\u5f31\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece37%\u63d0\u5347\u523077%\uff0c\u5f3a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8d85\u8fc790%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u9886\u57df\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u4fdd\u630195-100%\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u957f\u64ad\u5ba2\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike previous agents that only scale up model size or context length, MiroThinker explores interaction scaling at the model level, systematically training the model to handle deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions as a third dimension of performance improvement. Unlike LLM test-time scaling, which operates in isolation and risks degradation with longer reasoning chains, interactive scaling leverages environment feedback and external information acquisition to correct errors and refine trajectories. Through reinforcement learning, the model achieves efficient interaction scaling: with a 256K context window, it can perform up to 600 tool calls per task, enabling sustained multi-turn reasoning and complex real-world research workflows. Across four representative benchmarks-GAIA, HLE, BrowseComp, and BrowseComp-ZH-the 72B variant achieves up to 81.9%, 37.7%, 47.1%, and 55.6% accuracy respectively, surpassing previous open-source agents and approaching commercial counterparts such as GPT-5-high. Our analysis reveals that MiroThinker benefits from interactive scaling consistently: research performance improves predictably as the model engages in deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions, demonstrating that interaction depth exhibits scaling behaviors analogous to model size and context length. These findings establish interaction scaling as a third critical dimension for building next-generation open research agents, complementing model capacity and context windows.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiroThinker v1.0\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\uff08interaction scaling\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u3002MiroThinker\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u548c\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u4ee3\u7406-\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u6700\u591a600\u6b21\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08GAIA\u3001HLE\u3001BrowseComp\u3001BrowseComp-ZH\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c72B\u53d8\u4f53\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523081.9%\u300137.7%\u300147.1%\u548c55.6%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7406\u5e76\u63a5\u8fd1\u5546\u4e1a\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\u5982GPT-5-high\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u88ab\u786e\u7acb\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5f00\u6e90\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We assess definitions of reasoning and how key papers in the field of natural language processing (NLP) use the notion and argue that the definitions provided are not consistent with how LMs are trained, process information, and generate new tokens. To illustrate this incommensurability we assume the view that transformer-based LMs implement an \\textit{implicit} finite-order Markov kernel mapping contexts to conditional token distributions. In this view, reasoning-like outputs correspond to statistical regularities and approximate statistical invariances in the learned kernel rather than the implementation of explicit logical mechanisms. This view is illustrative of the claim that LMs are \"statistical pattern matchers\"\" and not genuine reasoners and provides a perspective that clarifies why reasoning-like outputs arise in LMs without any guarantees of logical consistency.

While LLMs show promise in generating structured outputs from natural language (NL), such as Gherkin Scenarios from NL feature requirements, there's currently no formal method to verify if these outputs are accurate. This paper takes a preliminary step toward addressing this gap by exploring the use of a simple LLM-based autoformalizer to verify LLM-generated outputs against a small set of natural language requirements. We conducted two distinct experiments. In the first one, the autoformalizer successfully identified that two differently-worded NL requirements were logically equivalent, demonstrating the pipeline's potential for consistency checks. In the second, the autoformalizer was used to identify a logical inconsistency between a given NL requirement and an LLM-generated output, highlighting its utility as a formal verification tool. Our findings, while limited, suggest that autoformalization holds significant potential for ensuring the fidelity and logical consistency of LLM-generated outputs, laying a crucial foundation for future, more extensive studies into this novel application.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u867d\u7136LLM\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9a8c\u8bc1LLM\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e00\uff1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5668\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u8ff0\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4e0a\u662f\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e8c\uff1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed9\u5b9a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u4e0eLLM\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5728\u786e\u4fddLLM\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The framework enables the extraction of high-level and low-level concepts conveyed through the narrative. Using dictionary-based sentiment analysis, our approach applies a custom lexicon built with the LabMTsimple storylab module. The custom lexicon is based on the Valence, Arousal, and Dominance scores from the NRC-VAD dataset.

A refined prompt for GPT-OSS-20B further improved reasoning accuracy.

Our analysis reveals its thematic breadth (3,200 topics) and unique linguistic properties, like the natural asymmetry in patient-doctor communication. To validate its utility, we benchmark a medical specialty routing task: fine-tuning a 1.7B parameter model achieves an outstanding 94\\% F1-score on a 20-class setup. Furthermore, our qualitative error analysis shows misclassifications are not random but reflect genuine clinical ambiguities (e.g., between comorbid conditions), proving the dataset's deep semantic richness.

However, when applied to sensitive data, this approach poses significant security risks. To address this issue, we propose a security-motivated alternative: restrict LLMs from direct code generation and data access, and require them to interact with data exclusively through a predefined set of secure, verified tools. Although recent tool-use benchmarks exist, they primarily target tool selection and simple execution rather than the compositional, multi-step reasoning needed for complex data analysis. To reduce this gap, we introduce Indirect Data Engagement (InData), a dataset designed to assess LLMs' multi-step tool-based reasoning ability. InData includes data analysis questions at three difficulty levels--Easy, Medium, and Hard--capturing increasing reasoning complexity. We benchmark 15 open-source LLMs on InData and find that while large models (e.g., gpt-oss-120b) achieve high accuracy on Easy tasks (97.3%), performance drops sharply on Hard tasks (69.6%).

Past work found that models are miscalibrated, with entropy per step increasing (and text quality decreasing) as generations grow longer. This error accumulation is a fundamental problem in autoregressive models, and the standard solution is to truncate the distribution, which improves text quality at the cost of diversity. In this paper, we ask: is miscalibration likely to improve with scale, and is it theoretically possible to calibrate without tradeoffs? To build intuition, we first study a simplified theoretical setting to characterize the scaling behavior of miscalibration with respect to dataset size. We find that the scaling behavior depends on the power law exponent of the data distribution -- in particular, for a power law exponent close to 1, the scaling exponent is close to 0, meaning that miscalibration improves very slowly with scale. Next, we measure miscalibration empirically in language models ranging from 0.5B to 70B parameters. We find that the observed scaling behavior is similar to what is predicted by the simplified setting: our fitted scaling exponents for text are close to 0, meaning that larger models accumulate error at a similar rate as smaller ones. This scaling (or, lack thereof) provides one explanation for why we sample from larger models with similar amounts of truncation as smaller models, even though the larger models are of higher quality. However, truncation is not a satisfying solution because it comes at the cost of increased log loss. In theory, is it even possible to reduce entropy while preserving log loss? We prove that it is possible, if we assume access to a black box which can fit models to predict the future entropy of text.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u71b5\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u6539\u5584\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u622a\u65ad\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u71b5\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u662f\u5426\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u800c\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u4ee3\u4ef7\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57280.5B\u523070B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6d4b\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u6307\u6570\u63a5\u8fd10\uff0c\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u76f8\u4f3c\u901f\u7387\u79ef\u7d2f\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5373\u4f7f\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4ecd\u9700\u76f8\u4f3c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u622a\u65ad\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5047\u8bbe\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6587\u672c\u672a\u6765\u71b5\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u6570\u635f\u5931\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u71b5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u6539\u5584\u7f13\u6162\u3002"}}

They excel at generating entities by semantic pattern matching but lack an explicit, verifiable reasoning mechanism. This \"cognitive shortcutting\" leads to suboptimal performance and brittle generalization, especially in zero-shot and lowresource scenarios where reasoning from limited contextual cues is crucial. To address this issue, a reasoning framework is proposed for NER, which shifts the extraction paradigm from implicit pattern matching to explicit reasoning. This framework consists of three stages: Chain of Thought (CoT) generation, CoT tuning, and reasoning enhancement. First, a dataset annotated with NER-oriented CoTs is generated, which contain task-relevant reasoning chains. Then, they are used to tune the NER model to generate coherent rationales before deriving the final answer. Finally, a reasoning enhancement stage is implemented to optimize the reasoning process using a comprehensive reward signal. This stage ensures explicit and verifiable extractions. Experiments show that ReasoningNER demonstrates impressive cognitive ability in the NER task, achieving competitive performance. In zero-shot settings, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming GPT-4 by 12.3 percentage points on the F1 score.

We study this double-edged role of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations in multimodal moral scenarios by systematically perturbing reasoning chains and manipulating delivery tones. Specifically, we analyze reasoning errors in vision language models (VLMs) and how they impact user trust and the ability to detect errors. Our findings reveal two key effects: (1) users often equate trust with outcome agreement, sustaining reliance even when reasoning is flawed, and (2) the confident tone suppresses error detection while maintaining reliance, showing that delivery styles can override correctness. These results highlight how CoT explanations can simultaneously clarify and mislead, underscoring the need for NLP systems to provide explanations that encourage scrutiny and critical thinking rather than blind trust.

Existing methods focus on de-contextualized correctness or forced-choice judgments, overlooking the need for cultural understanding and reasoning required for appropriate responses. To address this gap, we introduce a set of benchmarks that, instead of directly probing abstract norms or isolated statements, present models with realistic situational contexts that require culturally grounded reasoning. In addition to the standard Exact Match metric, we introduce four complementary metrics (Coverage, Specificity, Connotation, and Coherence) to capture different dimensions of model's response quality. Empirical analysis across frontier models reveals that thin evaluation systematically overestimates cultural competence and produces unstable assessments with high variance. In contrast, thick evaluation exposes differences in reasoning depth, reduces variance, and provides more stable, interpretable signals of cultural understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u5883\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6587\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u8865\u5145\u6307\u6807\u6765\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u53bb\u8bed\u5883\u5316\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6216\u5f3a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6587\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u5883\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u6307\u6807\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u3001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u5185\u6db5\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u56db\u4e2a\u8865\u5145\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8584\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u9ad8\u4f30\u6587\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u539a\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6587\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u539a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8861\u91cf\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6587\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

Next, we fine-tune (FT) the model on a genuine small parallel dataset drawn from diverse Japanese news and literary corpora, achieving a substantial jump to COMET = 0.589 when using Mistral 7B. Finally, we integrate both backtranslation and fine-tuning{ -- }first augmenting the small dataset with BT generated examples, then adapting via FT{ -- }which further boosts performance to COMET = 0.597.

However, existing studies remain limited by: **1) pseudo-multimodality**, where visual cues appear only in source posts while comments are treated as text-only, misaligning with real-world multimodal interactions; and **2) user homogeneity**, where diverse users are treated uniformly, neglecting personal traits that shape stance expression. To address these issues, we introduce **U-MStance**, the first user-centric MCSD dataset, containing over 40k annotated comments across six real-world targets. We further propose **PRISM**, a **P**ersona-**R**easoned mult**I**modal **S**tance **M**odel for MCSD. PRISM first derives longitudinal user personas from historical posts and comments to capture individual traits, then aligns textual and visual cues within conversational context via Chain-of-Thought to bridge semantic and pragmatic gaps across modalities. Finally, a mutual task reinforcement mechanism is employed to jointly optimize stance detection and stance-aware response generation for bidirectional knowledge transfer.

This reference-free framework not only effectively handles rich-context scenarios, but also offers interpretability. To facilitate this, an innovative pipeline is accordingly designed for generating instruction-tuning data (R-Instruct), featuring rich-context descriptions, grounding masks, and hard negative samples. We further establish R^2 -HalBench, a new hallucination benchmark for MLLMs, which, unlike previous benchmarks, encompasses real-world, rich-context descriptions from 18 MLLMs with high-quality annotations, spanning diverse object-, attribute, and relationship-level details. VBackChecker outperforms prior complex frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on R^2 -HalBench, even rivaling GPT-4o's capabilities in hallucination detection.

Therefore, the automatic summarization of legal documents has attracted serious attention from natural language processing researchers. Since the abstractive summaries of legal documents generated by deep neural methods remain prone to the risk of misrepresenting nuanced legal jargon or overlooking key contextual details, we envisage a rising trend toward the use of extractive case summarizers.\n  Given the high cost of human annotation for gold standard extractive summaries, we engineer a light and transparent pipeline that leverages existing abstractive gold standard summaries to create the corresponding extractive gold standard versions. The approach ensures that the experts` opinions ensconced in the original gold standard abstractive summaries are carried over to the transformed extractive summaries. We aim to augment seven existing case summarization datasets, which include abstractive summaries, by incorporating corresponding extractive summaries and create an enriched data resource for case summarization research community.

Large language models (LLMs) face the same challenge: suppressing a concept requires internally activating it, which may prime rebound instead of avoidance. We investigated this tension with two experiments. \\textbf{(1) Load \\& content}: after a negation instruction, we vary distractor text (semantic, syntactic, repetition) and measure rebound strength. \\textbf{(2) Polarity separation}: We test whether models distinguish neutral from negative framings of the same concept and whether this separation predicts rebound persistence. Results show that rebound consistently arises immediately after negation and intensifies with longer or semantic distractors, while repetition supports suppression. Stronger polarity separation correlates with more persistent rebound. Together, these findings, complemented by a circuit tracing analysis that identifies sparse middle-layer attention heads amplifying forbidden tokens while early layers suppress, link cognitive predictions of ironic rebound with mechanistic insights into long-context interference.

Existing multilingual benchmarks often rely on translated English datasets, failing to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of the target language. To address this gap, we introduce ILAKKANAM, the first Tamil-specific linguistic evaluation benchmark manually curated using 820 questions from Sri Lankan school-level Tamil subject examination papers. Each question is annotated by trained linguists under five linguistic categories and a factual knowledge category, spanning Grades 1--13 to ensure broad linguistic coverage. We evaluate both closed-source and open-source LLMs using a standardized evaluation framework. Our results show that Gemini 2.5 achieves the highest overall performance, while open-source models lag behind, highlighting the gap in linguistic grounding. Category- and grade-wise analyses reveal that all models perform well on lower-grade questions but show a clear decline as linguistic complexity increases. Further, no strong correlation is observed between a model's overall performance and its ability to identify linguistic categories, suggesting that performance may be driven by exposure rather than genuine understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "ILAKKANAM\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u6cf0\u7c73\u5c14\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b820\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u65af\u91cc\u5170\u5361\u5b66\u6821\u8003\u8bd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u4f4e\u5e74\u7ea7\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u4f46\u968f\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cGemini 2.5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u82f1\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6cf0\u7c73\u5c14\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u5316\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528820\u4e2a\u65af\u91cc\u5170\u5361\u5b66\u6821\u6cf0\u7c73\u5c14\u8bed\u8003\u8bd5\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7531\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u7d20\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5bb6\u57285\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7c7b\u522b\u548c1\u4e2a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0b\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6db5\u76d61-13\u5e74\u7ea7\u3002", "result": "Gemini 2.5\u603b\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u843d\u540e\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u5e74\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7c7b\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u65e0\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u6cf0\u7c73\u5c14\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u80fd\u7531\u66dd\u5149\u9a71\u52a8\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u6539\u5584\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

In this work, we address the evaluation challenge of reward models by probing preference representations. To confirm the effectiveness of this evaluation method, we construct a Multi-dimensional Reward Model Benchmark (MRMBench), a collection of six probing tasks for different preference dimensions. We design it to favor and encourage reward models that better capture preferences across different dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce an analysis method, inference-time probing, which identifies the dimensions used during the reward prediction and enhances its interpretability. Through extensive experiments, we find that MRMBench strongly correlates with the alignment performance of large language models (LLMs), making it a reliable reference for developing advanced reward models. Our analysis of MRMBench evaluation results reveals that reward models often struggle to capture preferences across multiple dimensions, highlighting the potential of multi-objective optimization in reward modeling.

We introduce QA-Noun, a QA-based framework for capturing noun-centered semantic relations. QA-Noun defines nine question templates that cover both explicit syntactical and implicit contextual roles for nouns, producing interpretable QA pairs that complement verbal QA-SRL. We release detailed guidelines, a dataset of over 2,000 annotated noun mentions, and a trained model integrated with QA-SRL to yield a unified decomposition of sentence meaning into individual, highly fine-grained, facts. Evaluation shows that QA-Noun achieves near-complete coverage of AMR's noun arguments while surfacing additional contextually implied relations, and that combining QA-Noun with QA-SRL yields over 130\\% higher granularity than recent fact-based decomposition methods such as FactScore and DecompScore. QA-Noun thus complements the broader QA-based semantic framework, forming a comprehensive and scalable approach to fine-grained semantic decomposition for cross-text alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "QA-Noun\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u540d\u8bcd\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc79\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u6a21\u677f\u6355\u6349\u540d\u8bcd\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u53e5\u6cd5\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4e0eQA-SRL\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u53e5\u5b50\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eQA\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8c13\u8bcd-\u8bba\u5143\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u540d\u8bcd\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8865\u5145\u540d\u8bcd\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e499\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u6a21\u677f\u8986\u76d6\u540d\u8bcd\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4e0eQA-SRL\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u610f\u4e49\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "result": "QA-Noun\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u8986\u76d6AMR\u7684\u540d\u8bcd\u8bba\u5143\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u989d\u5916\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9690\u542b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e0eQA-SRL\u7ed3\u5408\u6bd4FactScore\u548cDecompScore\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8130%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "QA-Noun\u5b8c\u5584\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eQA\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, RLHF-trained reward models often exhibit length bias -- a systematic tendency to favor longer responses by conflating verbosity with quality. We propose a causal framework for analyzing and mitigating length bias in RLHF reward modeling. Central to our approach is a counterfactual data augmentation method that generates response pairs designed to isolate content quality from verbosity. These counterfactual examples are then used to train the reward model, enabling it to assess responses based on content quality independently of verbosity. Specifically, we construct (1) length-divergent pairs with similar content and (2) content-divergent pairs of similar length.

In this paper, to bridge the gap, we collect MMWOZ, a new multimodal dialogue dataset that is extended from MultiWOZ 2.3 dataset. Specifically, we begin by developing a web-style GUI to serve as the front-end. Next, we devise an automated script to convert the dialogue states and system actions from the original dataset into operation instructions for the GUI. Lastly, we collect snapshots of the web pages along with their corresponding operation instructions. In addition, we propose a novel multimodal model called MATE (Multimodal Agent for Task-oriEnted dialogue) as the baseline model for the MMWOZ dataset.

We introduce Group-Aware Policy Optimization (GAPO), a simple extension of the recent and popular Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that computes rewards over the group as a whole. GAPO enables learning from the group-level properties such as diversity and coverage.

As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee's Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the Qwen2.5-7B dense architecture, we build Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech. Architecturally, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer. For training, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning. Data-wise, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues. Extensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves SOTA or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (reducing WER by 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Uni-MoE 2.0\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eQwen2.5-7B\u67b6\u6784\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5bb9\u91cfMoE\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5339\u914d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u8fdbLychee Uni-MoE\u7cfb\u5217\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u5168\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5bb9\u91cfMoE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u3001\u8def\u7531\u548c\u7a7a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff1bOmni-Modality 3D RoPE\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1bGSPO-DPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea675B token\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u572885\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6216\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u572876\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u8d85\u8fc750\u4e2a\u4f18\u4e8eQwen2.5-Omni\uff08\u4f7f\u75281.2T token\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\uff1b\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u53477%\uff0c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u53477%\uff0c\u89c6\u542c\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u53474%\uff1b\u957f\u8bed\u97f3\u5904\u7406WER\u964d\u4f4e4.2%\uff1b\u5728\u4f4e\u7ea7\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u9886\u5148\u3002", "conclusion": "Uni-MoE 2.0\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684MoE\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9886\u5148\u5730\u4f4d\u3002"}}

We find that SFT-based methods, e.g., Reason-KE, while state-of-the-art, suffer from a \"faithfulness gap\": they optimize for format mimicry rather than sound reasoning. This gap enables the LLM's powerful parametric priors to override new contextual facts, resulting in critical factual hallucinations (e.g., incorrectly reasoning \"Houston\" from \"NASA\" despite an explicit edit). To solve this core LLM alignment problem, we propose Reason-KE++, an SFT+RL framework that instills process-level faithfulness.

However, direct S2ST models require large amounts of parallel speech data in the source and target languages, which are rarely available for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper presents a direct S2ST system for translating Persian speech into English speech, as well as a pipeline for synthetic parallel Persian-English speech generation. The model comprises three components: (1) a conformer-based encoder, initialized from self-supervised pre-training, maps source speech to high-level acoustic representations; (2) a causal transformer decoder with relative position multi-head attention translates these representations into discrete target speech units; (3) a unit-based neural vocoder generates waveforms from the predicted discrete units. To mitigate the data scarcity problem, we construct a new Persian-English parallel speech corpus by translating Persian speech transcriptions into English using a large language model and then synthesizing the corresponding English speech with a state-of-the-art zero-shot text-to-speech system. The resulting corpus increases the amount of available parallel speech by roughly a factor of six. On the Persian-English portion of the CVSS corpus, the proposed model achieves improvement of 4.6 ASR BLEU with the synthetic data over direct baselines. These results indicate that combining self-supervised pre-training, discrete speech units, and synthetic parallel data is effective for improving direct S2ST in low-resource language pairs such as Persian-English", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u5230\u82f1\u8bed\u76f4\u63a5\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u97f3\u5355\u5143\u548c\u5408\u6210\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a5\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u975e\u5e38\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8econformer\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u56e0\u679ctransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5143\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u58f0\u7801\u5668\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u8bed\u97f3\u7cfb\u7edf\u5408\u6210\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u5728CVSS\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed-\u82f1\u8bed\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e864.6 ASR BLEU\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u97f3\u5355\u5143\u548c\u5408\u6210\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed-\u82f1\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002"}}

This binds their creativity and leaves them unable to autonomously invent entirely new attack mechanisms. To overcome this gap, we introduce \\textbf{EvoSynth}, an autonomous framework that shifts the paradigm from attack planning to the evolutionary synthesis of jailbreak methods. Instead of refining prompts, EvoSynth employs a multi-agent system to autonomously engineer, evolve, and execute novel, code-based attack algorithms. Crucially, it features a code-level self-correction loop, allowing it to iteratively rewrite its own attack logic in response to failure. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that EvoSynth not only establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving an 85.5\\% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against highly robust models like Claude-Sonnet-4.5, but also generates attacks that are significantly more diverse than those from existing methods.

We investigate this paradox through a focused study with two key design features: simplicity, to expose basic failure modes, and scale, to enable comprehensive controlled experiments. We focus on set membership queries -- among the most fundamental forms of reasoning -- using tasks like ``Is apple an element of the set \\{pear, plum, apple, raspberry\\}?''. We conduct a systematic empirical evaluation across prompt phrasing, semantic structure, element ordering, and model choice. Our large-scale analysis reveals that LLM performance on this elementary task is consistently brittle, and unpredictable across all dimensions, suggesting that the models' ``understanding'' of the set concept is fragmented and convoluted at best.

Prior work, such as that of Wei et al., demonstrated these phenomena under model and data scaling, with transitions revealed after applying a log scale to training compute. In this work, we ask three complementary questions: (1) Are phase transitions unique to large models, or can they also be observed in small transformer-based language models? (2) Can such transitions be detected directly in linear training space, rather than only after log rescaling? and (3) Can these transitions emerge at early stages of training? To investigate, we train a small GPT-style transformer on a character-level corpus and analyze the evolution of vocabulary usage throughout training. We track the average word length, the number of correct versus incorrect words, and shifts in vocabulary diversity. Building on these measures, we apply Poisson and sub-Poisson statistics to quantify how words connect and reorganize. This combined analysis reveals a distinct transition point during training. Notably, these transitions are not apparent in standard loss or validation curves, but become visible through our vocabulary- and statistics-based probes. Our findings suggest that phase-transition reorganizations are a general feature of language model training, observable even in modest models, detectable directly in linear training space, and occurring surprisingly early as coherence emerges. This perspective provides new insight into the nonlinear dynamics of language model training and underscores the importance of tailored metrics for uncovering phase transition behaviors", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e5f\u80fd\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u53d8\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u5c31\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u53d8\u662f\u5426\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u5c31\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578bGPT\u98ce\u683ctransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bcd\u6c47\u4f7f\u7528\u6f14\u53d8\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u8bcd\u957f\u3001\u6b63\u786e/\u9519\u8bef\u8bcd\u6570\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u6cca\u677e\u548c\u4e9a\u6cca\u677e\u7edf\u8ba1\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8bcd\u6c47\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u91cd\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u53d8\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u635f\u5931\u6216\u9a8c\u8bc1\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e2d\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a2\u9488\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u53d8\u91cd\u7ec4\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u666e\u904d\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We present BioMedJImpact, a large-scale, biomedical-oriented dataset designed to advance journal-level analysis of scientific impact and AI engagement. Built from 1.74 million PubMed Central articles across 2,744 journals, BioMedJImpact integrates bibliometric indicators, collaboration features, and LLM-derived semantic indicators for AI engagement. Specifically, the AI engagement feature is extracted through a reproducible three-stage LLM pipeline that we propose. Using this dataset, we analyze how collaboration intensity and AI engagement jointly influence scientific impact across pre- and post-pandemic periods (2016-2019, 2020-2023). Two consistent trends emerge: journals with higher collaboration intensity, particularly those with larger and more diverse author teams, tend to achieve greater citation impact, and AI engagement has become an increasingly strong correlate of journal prestige, especially in quartile rankings. To further validate the three-stage LLM pipeline we proposed for deriving the AI engagement feature, we conduct human evaluation, confirming substantial agreement in AI relevance detection and consistent subfield classification. Together, these contributions demonstrate that BioMedJImpact serves as both a comprehensive dataset capturing the intersection of biomedicine and AI, and a validated methodological framework enabling scalable, content-aware scientometric analysis of scientific impact and innovation dynamics.

This paper demonstrates that targeted activation engineering can steer LLaMA 3.1-8B to exhibit more human-like emotional nuances. We first employ attribution patching to identify causally influential components, to find a key intervention locus by observing activation patterns during diagnostic conversational tasks. We then derive emotional expression vectors from the difference in the activations generated by contrastive text pairs (positive vs. negative examples of target emotions). Applying these vectors to new conversational prompts significantly enhances emotional characteristics: steered responses show increased positive sentiment (e.g., joy, trust) and more frequent first-person pronoun usage, indicative of greater personal engagement.

It is widely applied in fields such as information retrieval, content summarisation, and trend analysis across various disciplines. However, probabilistic topic models can produce different results when rerun due to their stochastic nature, leading to inconsistencies in latent topics. Factors like corpus shuffling, rare text removal, and document elimination contribute to these variations. This instability affects replicability, reliability, and interpretation, raising concerns about whether topic models capture meaningful topics or just noise. To address these problems, we defined a new stability measure that incorporates accuracy and consistency and uses the generative properties of LDA to generate a new corpus with ground truth. These generated corpora are run through LDA 50 times to determine the variability in the output. We show that LDA can correctly determine the underlying number of topics in the documents.

Existing models still suffer from challenges such as opaque reasoning paths and insufficient generalization ability. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, which has demonstrated significant efficacy in language models by enhancing reasoning transparency and output interpretability, holds promise for improving model reasoning capabilities when extended to the multimodal domain. This paper provides a systematic review centered on \"Multimodal Chain-of-Thought\" (MCoT). First, it analyzes the background and theoretical motivations for its inception from the perspectives of technical evolution and task demands.

GPT-2 showed lowest overall accuracy (79.34% binary, 71.29% multiclass), while DeBERTa achieved moderate results (80.70% binary, 71.56% multiclass) but at substantially higher computational cost (947s for multiclass training). Error analysis revealed architecture-specific strengths in detecting nuanced hope expressions, with GPT-2 excelling at sarcasm detection (92.46% recall).

Building on this, we introduce \\textit{Visual Room} 2.0, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating perception-cognition alignment of MLLMs. We model human perceptive and cognitive processes across three levels: low, middle, and high, covering 17 representative tasks. The perception component ranges from attribute recognition to scene understanding, while the cognition component extends from textual entailment to causal and social reasoning. The dataset contains 350 multi-modal samples, each with six progressive questions (2,100 in total) spanning perception to cognition. Evaluating 10 state-of-the-art (SoTA) MLLMs, we highlight three key findings: (1) MLLMs exhibit stronger perceptual competence than cognitive ability (8.0\\%$\\uparrow$); (2) cognition appears not causally dependent on perception-based reasoning; and (3) cognition scales with model size, but perception does not consistently improve with larger variants.

However, this crucial trait is severely undermined by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), a common technique for model specialization. Existing recovery methods rely on data-intensive global parameter adjustments, implicitly assuming that SFT deeply corrupts the models' ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries. However, we observe that fine-tuned LLMs still preserve this ability; what is damaged is their capacity to faithfully express that awareness.

HCNR identifies and restores key expression-governing neurons to their pre-trained state while harmonizing them with task-oriented neurons via Hessian-guided compensation.

But is this victory complete? Are the multilingual models better than aligned monolingual models in every aspect? Can the higher computational cost of multilingual models always be justified? Or is there a compromise between the two extremes? Bilingual Lexicon Induction is one of the most widely used metrics in terms of evaluating the degree of alignment between two embedding spaces. In this study, we explore the strengths and limitations of BLI as a measure to evaluate the degree of alignment of two embedding spaces. Further, we evaluate how well traditional embedding alignment techniques, novel multilingual models, and combined alignment techniques perform BLI tasks in the contexts of both high-resource and low-resource languages. In addition to that, we investigate the impact of the language families to which the pairs of languages belong. We identify that BLI does not measure the true degree of alignment in some cases and we propose solutions for them. We propose a novel stem-based BLI approach to evaluate two aligned embedding spaces that take into account the inflected nature of languages as opposed to the prevalent word-based BLI techniques. Further, we introduce a vocabulary pruning technique that is more informative in showing the degree of the alignment, especially performing BLI on multilingual embedding models. Often, combined embedding alignment techniques perform better while in certain cases multilingual embeddings perform better (mainly low-resource language cases).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cc\u8bed\u8bcd\u5178\u5f52\u7eb3(BLI)\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86BLI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5e72\u7684\u65b0BLI\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u6d41\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u662f\u5426\u5728\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u662f\u5426\u603b\u662f\u5408\u7406\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u8bed\u8bcd\u5178\u5f52\u7eb3(BLI)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u3001\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u8a00\u5bb6\u65cf\u5bf9BLI\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5e72\u7684BLI\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0BLI\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e0d\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8861\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u7ec4\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff08\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5e72\u7684BLI\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we introduce Spark-Prover-X1, a 7B parameter model trained via an three-stage framework designed to unlock the reasoning potential of more accessible and moderately-sized LLMs. The first stage infuses deep knowledge through continuous pre-training on a broad mathematical corpus, enhanced by a suite of novel data tasks. Key innovation is a \"CoT-augmented state prediction\" task to achieve fine-grained reasoning. The second stage employs Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) within an expert iteration loop to specialize both the Spark-Prover-X1-7B and Spark-Formalizer-X1-7B models. Finally, a targeted round of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied to sharpen the prover's capabilities on the most challenging problems. To facilitate robust evaluation, particularly on problems from real-world examinations, we also introduce ExamFormal-Bench, a new benchmark dataset of 402 formal problems. Experimental results demonstrate that Spark-Prover-X1-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among similarly-sized open-source models, attaining a 37.0\\% average pass rate (pass@32). It shows exceptional performance on difficult competition benchmarks, notably solving 27 problems on PutnamBench (pass@32) and achieving 24.0\\% on CombiBench (pass@32).

Manual verification of CONSORT adherence is a laborious, time-intensive process that constitutes a significant bottleneck in peer review and evidence synthesis. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the accuracy and reliability of contemporary LLMs in identifying the adherence of published RCTs to the CONSORT 2010 statement under a zero-shot setting. We constructed a golden standard dataset of 150 published RCTs spanning diverse medical specialties. The primary outcome was the macro-averaged F1-score for the three-class classification task, supplemented by item-wise performance metrics and qualitative error analysis. Overall model performance was modest. The top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Flash and DeepSeek-R1, achieved nearly identical macro F1 scores of 0.634 and Cohen's Kappa coefficients of 0.280 and 0.282, respectively, indicating only fair agreement with expert consensus. A striking performance disparity was observed across classes: while most models could identify compliant items with high accuracy (F1 score > 0.850), they struggled profoundly with identifying non-compliant and not applicable items, where F1 scores rarely exceeded 0.400. Notably, some high-profile models like GPT-4o underperformed, achieving a macro F1-score of only 0.521.

Direct prompting often yields incomplete or structurally invalid outputs--such as misclassified triggers, missing arguments, and schema violations. To address these limitations, we present Agent-Event-Coder (AEC), a novel multi-agent framework that treats event extraction like software engineering: as a structured, iterative code-generation process. AEC decomposes ZSEE into specialized subtasks--retrieval, planning, coding, and verification--each handled by a dedicated LLM agent. Event schemas are represented as executable class definitions, enabling deterministic validation and precise feedback via a verification agent. This programming-inspired approach allows for systematic disambiguation and schema enforcement through iterative refinement. By leveraging collaborative agent workflows, AEC enables LLMs to produce precise, complete, and schema-consistent extractions in zero-shot settings. Experiments across five diverse domains and six LLMs demonstrate that AEC consistently outperforms prior zero-shot baselines, showcasing the power of treating event extraction like code generation.

Developing accurate grammar scoring models further requires extensive expert annotation, making large-scale data creation impractical. To address these limitations, we propose a zero-shot grammar competency estimation framework that leverages unlabeled data and Large Language Models (LLMs) without relying on manual labels. During training, we employ LLM-generated predictions on unlabeled data by using grammar competency rubric-based prompts. These predictions, treated as pseudo labels, are utilized to train a transformer-based model through a novel training framework designed to handle label noise effectively. We show that the choice of LLM for pseudo-label generation critically affects model performance and that the ratio of clean-to-noisy samples during training strongly influences stability and accuracy. Finally, a qualitative analysis of error intensity and score prediction confirms the robustness and interpretability of our approach.

Building upon prior foundational work such as TCM-3CEval, which highlighted systemic knowledge gaps and the importance of cultural-contextual alignment, we introduce TCM-5CEval, a more granular and comprehensive benchmark. TCM-5CEval is designed to assess LLMs across five critical dimensions: (1) Core Knowledge (TCM-Exam), (2) Classical Literacy (TCM-LitQA), (3) Clinical Decision-making (TCM-MRCD), (4) Chinese Materia Medica (TCM-CMM), and (5) Clinical Non-pharmacological Therapy (TCM-ClinNPT). We conducted a thorough evaluation of fifteen prominent LLMs, revealing significant performance disparities and identifying top-performing models like deepseek\\_r1 and gemini\\_2\\_5\\_pro. Our findings show that while models exhibit proficiency in recalling foundational knowledge, they struggle with the interpretative complexities of classical texts. Critically, permutation-based consistency testing reveals widespread fragilities in model inference.

Today, many translators exist, based on encoder-decoder deep architectures, nevertheless, no quantitative objective methods are available to assess their performance, likely because the entropy of even a single language remains unknown. This study presents a quantitative method for estimating translation entropy, with the following key finding. Given a translator, several sentences that differ by only one selected token of a given pivot sentence yield identical translations. Analyzing the statistics of this phenomenon across an ensemble of such sentences, consisting each of a pivot selected token, yields the probabilities of replacing this specific token with others while preserving the translation. These probabilities constitute the entropy of the selected token, and the average across all selected pivot tokens provides an estimate of the translator's overall translation entropy, which is enhanced along the decoder blocks. This entropic measure allows for the quantitative ranking of several publicly available translators and reveals whether mutual translation entropy is symmetric. Extending the proposed method to include the replacement of two tokens in a given pivot sentence demonstrates a multiplicative effect, where translation degeneracy is proportional to the product of the degeneracies of the two tokens. These findings establish translation entropy as a measurable property and objective benchmarking of artificial translators.

In this work, we benchmark the extent to which VLMs are able to act as highly-trained phoneticians, interpreting spectrograms and waveforms of speech. To do this, we synthesise a novel dataset containing 4k+ English words spoken in isolation alongside stylistically consistent spectrogram and waveform figures. We test the ability of VLMs to understand these representations of speech through a multiple-choice task whereby models must predict the correct phonemic or graphemic transcription of a spoken word when presented amongst 3 distractor transcriptions that have been selected based on their phonemic edit distance to the ground truth.

In this paper, we introduce Soup Of Category Experts (SoCE), a principled approach for model souping that utilizes benchmark composition to identify optimal model candidates and applies non-uniform weighted averaging to maximize performance. Contrary to previous uniform-averaging approaches, our method leverages the observation that benchmark categories often exhibit low inter-correlations in model performance. SoCE identifies \"expert\" models for each weakly-correlated category cluster and combines them using optimized weighted averaging rather than uniform weights.

Nevertheless, recent research has shown that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which could lead to significant economic losses for model providers. For copyright protection, existing methods inject watermark embeddings into text embeddings and use them to detect copyright infringement. However, current watermarking methods often resist only a subset of attacks and fail to provide \\textit{comprehensive} protection. To this end, we present the region-triggered semantic watermarking framework called RegionMarker, which defines trigger regions within a low-dimensional space and injects watermarks into text embeddings associated with these regions. By utilizing a secret dimensionality reduction matrix to project onto this subspace and randomly selecting trigger regions, RegionMarker makes it difficult for watermark removal attacks to evade detection. Furthermore, by embedding watermarks across the entire trigger region and using the text embedding as the watermark, RegionMarker is resilient to both paraphrasing and dimension-perturbation attacks.

We conduct a controlled PEFT/LoRA study across multiple open-weight LLM families and sizes, treating task and language as transfer axes while conditioning on model family and size; we fine-tune each model on a single task-language source and measure transfer as the percentage-point change versus its baseline score when evaluated on all other task-language target pairs. We decompose transfer into (i) Matched-Task (Cross-Language), (ii) Matched-Language (Cross-Task), and (iii) Cross-Task (Cross-Language) regimes. We uncover two consistent general patterns.

We developed PEDIASBench, a systematic evaluation framework centered on a knowledge-system framework and tailored to realistic clinical environments. PEDIASBench assesses LLMs across three dimensions: application of basic knowledge, dynamic diagnosis and treatment capability, and pediatric medical safety and medical ethics. We evaluated 12 representative models released over the past two years, including GPT-4o, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-V3, covering 19 pediatric subspecialties and 211 prototypical diseases. State-of-the-art models performed well on foundational knowledge, with Qwen3-235B-A22B achieving over 90% accuracy on licensing-level questions, but performance declined ~15% as task complexity increased, revealing limitations in complex reasoning. Multiple-choice assessments highlighted weaknesses in integrative reasoning and knowledge recall. In dynamic diagnosis and treatment scenarios, DeepSeek-R1 scored highest in case reasoning (mean 0.58), yet most models struggled to adapt to real-time patient changes. On pediatric medical ethics and safety tasks, Qwen2.5-72B performed best (accuracy 92.05%), though humanistic sensitivity remained limited. These findings indicate that pediatric LLMs are constrained by limited dynamic decision-making and underdeveloped humanistic care. Future development should focus on multimodal integration and a clinical feedback-model iteration loop to enhance safety, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. While current LLMs cannot independently perform pediatric care, they hold promise for decision support, medical education, and patient communication, laying the groundwork for a safe, trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent pediatric healthcare system.", "AI": {"tldr": "PEDIASBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u513f\u79d1\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8bca\u7597\u548c\u4eba\u6587\u5173\u6000\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u627f\u62c5\u513f\u79d1\u8bca\u7597\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80dc\u4efb\u513f\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5f53\u524d\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1PEDIASBench\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8bca\u7597\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u513f\u79d1\u533b\u7597\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3012\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u572819\u4e2a\u513f\u79d1\u4e9a\u4e13\u4e1a\u548c211\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u75be\u75c5\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff08Qwen3-235B-A22B\u5728\u6267\u4e1a\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8590%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea615%\uff1b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8bca\u7597\u4e2dDeepSeek-R1\u5f97\u5206\u6700\u9ad8\uff08\u5e73\u57470.58\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u65f6\u60a3\u8005\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4f26\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0aQwen2.5-72B\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u738792.05%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u513f\u79d1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u4eba\u6587\u5173\u6000\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6574\u5408\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53cd\u9988-\u6a21\u578b\u8fed\u4ee3\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4e0d\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u627f\u62c5\u513f\u79d1\u8bca\u7597\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u6c9f\u901a\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, linear extrapolation biases judgment on samples of different sizes, over-penalizing short samples and under-penalizing long ones, producing misalignment with expert intuition.\n  Building on the Multi-Range framework, this paper presents a calibrated, non-linear scoring model that better reflects how human content consumers perceive translation quality across samples of varying length. Empirical data from three large-scale enterprise environments shows that acceptable error counts grow logarithmically, not linearly, with sample size.\n  Psychophysical and cognitive evidence, including the Weber-Fechner law and Cognitive Load Theory, supports this premise by explaining why the perceptual impact of additional errors diminishes while the cognitive burden grows with scale. We propose a two-parameter model\n  E(x) = a * ln(1 + b * x), a, b > 0,\n  anchored to a reference tolerance and calibrated from two tolerance points using a one-dimensional root-finding step. The model yields an explicit interval within which the linear approximation stays within +/-20 percent relative error and integrates into existing evaluation workflows with only a dynamic tolerance function added.\n  The approach improves interpretability, fairness, and inter-rater reliability across both human and AI-generated translations.

We establish reproducible baselines on these datasets using publicly available ASR models, with the fine-tuned Fast Conformer model achieving word error rates as low as 14.18\\% on spontaneous and 4.8\\% on repeated speech. Diarization experiments yield diarization error rates between 13.05\\% and 18.26\\%, providing reference points for future improvements.

To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy for text-to-SQL classification based on dimensions including core intents, statement types, syntax structures, and key actions. Using this taxonomy, we evaluate widely used public text-to-SQL datasets (e.g., Spider and Bird) and reveal limitations in their coverage and diversity. We then introduce a taxonomy-guided dataset synthesis pipeline, yielding a new dataset named SQL-Synth. This approach combines the taxonomy with Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure the dataset reflects the breadth and complexity of real-world text-to-SQL applications. Extensive analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our taxonomy, as SQL-Synth exhibits greater diversity and coverage compared to existing benchmarks.

However, its layered meanings, cultural allusions, and sophisticated grammatical constructions often pose challenges for comprehension, especially for non-native speakers or readers unfamiliar with its context and language.

Our framework supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education (SDG 4) and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience. It includes (1) a translation module that uses an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm to accurately translate morphologically rich poetry into English, and (2) an image generation module that employs a semantic graph to capture tokens, dependencies, and semantic relationships between metaphors and their meanings, to create visually meaningful representations of Indian poems. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, including both human and quantitative assessments, demonstrates the superiority of TAI Diffusion in poem image generation tasks, outperforming strong baselines. To further address the scarcity of resources for Indian-language poetry, we introduce the Morphologically Rich Indian Language Poems MorphoVerse Dataset, comprising 1,570 poems across 21 low-resource Indian languages.

Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system.

In Transformers, positional information is typically encoded using Positional Encodings (PEs). One such popular PE, namely Rotary PE (RoPE), has been widely used due to its empirical success. Recently, it has been argued that part of RoPE's success emerges from its ability to encode robust positional and semantic information using large and small frequencies, respectively. In this work, we perform a deeper dive into the positional versus symbolic dichotomy of attention heads behavior, both at the theoretical and empirical level. We provide general definitions of what it means for a head to behave positionally or symbolically, prove that these are two mutually exclusive behaviors and develop a metric to quantify them. We apply our framework to analyze Transformer-based LLMs using RoPE and find that all heads exhibit a strong correspondence between behavior and frequency use. Finally, we introduce canonical tasks designed to be either purely positional or symbolic, and demonstrate that the Transformer performance causally relates to the ability of attention heads to leverage the appropriate frequencies. In particular, we show that we can control the Transformer performance by controlling which frequencies the attention heads can access. Altogether, our work provides a detailed understanding of RoPE, and how its properties relate to model behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e86Transformer\u4e2dRotary\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801(RoPE)\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6027\u5934\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u6027\u5934\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u9891\u7387\u53ef\u4ee5\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3RoPE\u6210\u529f\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u5206\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u7387\u7f16\u7801\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6027\u5934\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u6027\u5934\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528RoPE\u7684Transformer LLMs\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7eaf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6027\u548c\u7eaf\u7b26\u53f7\u6027\u7684\u5178\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u9891\u7387\u4f7f\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u9891\u7387\u53ef\u4ee5\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u5730\u63a7\u5236Transformer\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RoPE\u7684\u6210\u529f\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u9891\u7387\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Focusing on negative valence text, a critical component of sentiment analysis, we explore the use of LLM-generated synthetic news headlines as an alternative to real-world data. A specialized corpus of negative news headlines was created using tailored prompts to capture diverse negative sentiments across various societal domains. The synthetic headlines were validated by expert review and further analyzed in embedding space to assess their alignment with real-world negative news in terms of content, tone, length, and style.

CLINB relies on a dataset of real users' questions and evaluation rubrics curated by leading climate scientists. We implement and validate a model-based evaluation process and evaluate several frontier models. Our findings reveal a critical dichotomy. Frontier models demonstrate remarkable knowledge synthesis capabilities, often exhibiting PhD-level understanding and presentation quality. They outperform \"hybrid\" answers curated by domain experts assisted by weaker models. However, this performance is countered by failures in grounding.

In this work, we systematically study the effect of tokenizer design, specifically scaling and quantization strategies, on model performance, alongside the impact of pretraining versus random initialization.

Using a combination of empirical training experiments and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate that pretrained models consistently leverage well-designed tokenizers more effectively, particularly at smaller vocabulary sizes. Conversely, misaligned tokenization can diminish or even invert the benefits of pretraining. These findings highlight the importance of careful tokenization in time series modeling and suggest that combining small, efficient vocabularies with pretrained weights is especially advantageous in multi-modal forecasting settings, where the overall vocabulary must be shared across modalities.

Deploying smaller models (i.e., small language models (SLMs)) on edge devices offers additional advantages, such as reduced latency and independence from network connectivity. However, edge devices' limited computing resources and constrained energy budgets challenge efficient deployment. This study evaluates the power efficiency of five representative SLMs - Llama 3.2, Phi-3 Mini, TinyLlama, and Gemma 2 on Raspberry Pi 5, Jetson Nano, and Jetson Orin Nano (CPU and GPU configurations). Results show that Jetson Orin Nano with GPU acceleration achieves the highest energy-to-performance ratio, significantly outperforming CPU-based setups. Llama 3.2 provides the best balance of accuracy and power efficiency, while TinyLlama is well-suited for low-power environments at the cost of reduced accuracy. In contrast, Phi-3 Mini consumes the most energy despite its high accuracy. In addition, GPU acceleration, memory bandwidth, and model architecture are key in optimizing inference energy efficiency.

Manually designing questions is time-consuming and often fails to meet diverse learning needs, making automated question generation a crucial approach to reduce teachers' workload and improve the scalability of educational resources. However, most existing question generation methods rely on single-agent or rule-based pipelines, which still produce questions with unstable quality, limited diversity, and insufficient alignment with educational goals. To address these challenges, we propose EduAgentQG, a multi-agent collaborative framework for generating high-quality and diverse personalized questions. The framework consists of five specialized agents and operates through an iterative feedback loop: the Planner generates structured design plans and multiple question directions to enhance diversity; the Writer produces candidate questions based on the plan and optimizes their quality and diversity using feedback from the Solver and Educator; the Solver and Educator perform binary scoring across multiple evaluation dimensions and feed the evaluation results back to the Writer; the Checker conducts final verification, including answer correctness and clarity, ensuring alignment with educational goals. Through this multi-agent collaboration and iterative feedback loop, EduAgentQG generates questions that are both high-quality and diverse, while maintaining consistency with educational objectives.

This concept is loosely inspired by the idea of thought processes and dynamic reasoning, where information flow is conditioned not only on the data itself, but also on the internal state of the system.\n  It is important to note that this work does not aim to compete with state-of-the-art language models in terms of performance. Instead, it presents a conceptual prototype-an architectural framework that opens up a new direction for exploring adaptable and potentially more interpretable networks. The goal is not optimization of existing benchmarks but rather the proposal of a system that can learn not only representations, but also the structure of computation itself.\n  Due to practical constraints in computing resources and data, this study remains a preliminary investigation.

To solve these problems, recent research has focused on constructing cloud-edge consortia that integrate server-based LLM with small language models (SLMs) on mobile edge devices. Furthermore, designing collaborative training mechanisms within such consortia to enhance inference performance has emerged as a promising research direction. However, the cross-domain deployment of SLMs, coupled with structural heterogeneity in SLMs architectures, poses significant challenges to enhancing model performance. To this end, we propose Co-PLMs, a novel co-tuning framework for collaborative training of large and small language models, which integrates the process of structure-agnostic mutual learning to realize knowledge exchange between the heterogeneous language models. This framework employs distilled proxy models (DPMs) as bridges to enable collaborative training between the heterogeneous server-based LLM and on-device SLMs, while preserving the domain-specific insights of each device. The experimental results show that Co-PLMs outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving average increases of 5.38% in Rouge-L and 4.88% in EM.", "AI": {"tldr": "Co-PLMs\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u84b8\u998f\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bbe\u5907\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u6fc0\u589e\u4f7f\u5f97\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cfLLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u4e91\u8fb9\u534f\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u5408\u670d\u52a1\u5668LLM\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684SLM\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCo-PLMs\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u84b8\u998f\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u670d\u52a1\u5668LLM\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907SLM\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6865\u6881\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aCo-PLMs\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728Rouge-L\u548cEM\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53475.38%\u548c4.88%\u3002", "conclusion": "Co-PLMs\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea4\u6362\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

This is useful, e.g., for specifying and verifying desired system properties. While translating FOL into human-readable English is relatively straightforward, the inverse problem, converting NL to FOL (NL-FOL translation), has remained a longstanding challenge, for both humans and machines. Although the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised a breakthrough, recent literature provides contrasting results on their ability to perform NL-FOL translation. In this work, we provide a threefold contribution. First, we critically examine existing datasets and protocols for evaluating NL-FOL translation performance, revealing key limitations that may cause a misrepresentation of LLMs' actual capabilities. Second, to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel evaluation protocol explicitly designed to distinguish genuine semantic-level logical understanding from superficial pattern recognition, memorization, and dataset contamination.

Adversarial learning, particularly through self-play, offers a promising alternative that enables models to iteratively learn from themselves - thus reducing reliance on external supervision. Dual-play extends adversarial learning by assigning specialized roles to two models and training them against each other, fostering sustained competition and mutual evolution. Despite its promise, adapting dual-play training to LLMs remains limited, largely due to their susceptibility to reward hacking and training instability. In this paper, we introduce PasoDoble, a novel LLM dual-play framework. PasoDoble adversarially trains two models initialized from the same base model: a Proposer, which generates challenging questions with ground-truth answers, and a Solver, which attempts to solve them. We enrich the Proposer with knowledge from a pre-training dataset to ensure the questions' quality and diversity. To avoid reward hacking, the Proposer is rewarded for producing only valid questions that push the Solver's limit, while the Solver is rewarded for solving them correctly, and both are updated jointly. To further enhance training stability, we introduce an optional offline paradigm that decouples Proposer and Solver updates, alternately updating each for several steps while holding the other fixed. Notably, PasoDoble operates without supervision during training. Experimental results show that PasoDoble can improve the reasoning performance of LLMs. Our project page is available at https://hcy123902.github.io/PasoDoble.", "AI": {"tldr": "PasoDoble\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684LLM\u53cc\u89d2\u8272\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9Proposer\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u548cSolver\u5c1d\u8bd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u522b\u662f\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51cf\u5c11\u5916\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u53cc\u89d2\u8272\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6301\u7eed\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u5176\u9002\u914d\u5230LLM\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "PasoDoble\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ece\u540c\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1aProposer\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u771f\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0cSolver\u5c1d\u8bd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002Proposer\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u589e\u5f3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u95ee\u9898\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u907f\u514d\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\uff0cProposer\u4ec5\u56e0\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u6311\u6218Solver\u6781\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u83b7\u5956\u52b1\uff0cSolver\u56e0\u6b63\u786e\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u83b7\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u8054\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u53ef\u9009\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u8303\u5f0f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPasoDoble\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PasoDoble\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684LLM\u53cc\u89d2\u8272\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks.

This study addresses key research questions of how the job changes affect their upward career mobility, and how the outcomes of upward career mobility differ by gender and race. We address data challenges -- such as missing demographic attributes, missing wage data, and noisy occupation labels -- through various data processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. In particular, we develop a large language models (LLMs) based occupation classification method known as FewSOC that achieves accuracy significantly higher than the original occupation labels in the resume dataset. Analysis of 228,710 career trajectories reveals that intra-firm occupation change has been found to facilitate upward mobility most strongly, followed by inter-firm occupation change and inter-firm lateral move. Women and Black college graduates experience significantly lower returns from job changes than men and White peers.

In contrast to prior work that focuses on generating stable inorganic crystals, our approach targets the synthesizeability of a specific structural class: BCC/B2 superalloys, an underexplored family of materials with potential applications in extreme environments. Using three open-weight models (LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, and OLMo-2), we demonstrate that language models can be optimized for multiple design objectives using a single, unified reward signal through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike prior approaches that rely on heuristic or human-in-the-loop feedback (costly), our reward signal is derived from thermodynamic phase calculations, offering a scientifically grounded criterion for model tuning. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of preference-tuning a language model using physics-grounded feedback for structural alloy design.

Code available at https://github.com/bcmi/D3ToM-Diffusion-MLLM", "summary": "Diffusion-based multimodal large language models (Diffusion MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive non-autoregressive generative capabilities across vision-and-language tasks. However, Diffusion MLLMs exhibit substantially slower inference than autoregressive models: Each denoising step employs full bidirectional self-attention over the entire sequence, resulting in cubic decoding complexity that becomes computationally impractical with thousands of visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose D$^{3}$ToM, a Decider-guided dynamic token merging method that dynamically merges redundant visual tokens at different denoising steps to accelerate inference in Diffusion MLLMs. At each denoising step, D$^{3}$ToM uses decider tokens-the tokens generated in the previous denoising step-to build an importance map over all visual tokens. Then it maintains a proportion of the most salient tokens and merges the remainder through similarity-based aggregation. This plug-and-play module integrates into a single transformer layer, physically shortening the visual token sequence for all subsequent layers without altering model parameters. Moreover, D$^{3}$ToM employs a merge ratio that dynamically varies with each denoising step, aligns with the native decoding process of Diffusion MLLMs, achieving superior performance under equivalent computational budgets. Extensive experiments show that D$^{3}$ToM accelerates inference while preserving competitive performance.

As a baseline reference, we estimate the temporal span of tone cues to be about 100 ms in Burmese and Thai, and about 180 ms in Lao and Vietnamese. Probes and gradient analyses on fine-tuned SSL models reveal that tone transfer varies by downstream task: automatic speech recognition fine-tuning aligns spans with language-specific tone cues, while prosody- and voice-related tasks bias the model toward overly long spans.

A key limitation of current training datasets is their reliance on sparse annotations mined from the Internet or entered via manual typing that capture only a fraction of an image's visual content. Dense annotations are more valuable but remain scarce. Traditional text-based annotation pipelines are poorly suited for creating dense annotations: typing limits expressiveness, slows annotation speed, and underrepresents nuanced visual features, especially in specialized areas such as multicultural imagery and 3D asset annotation. In this paper, we present DenseAnnotate, an audio-driven online annotation platform that enables efficient creation of dense, fine-grained annotations for images and 3D assets. Annotators narrate observations aloud while synchronously linking spoken phrases to image regions or 3D scene parts. Our platform incorporates speech-to-text transcription and region-of-attention marking. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DenseAnnotate, we conducted case studies involving over 1,000 annotators across two domains: culturally diverse images and 3D scenes.

We present ToxSearch, a black-box evolutionary framework that tests model safety by evolving prompts in a synchronous steady-state loop. The system employs a diverse set of operators, including lexical substitutions, negation, back-translation, paraphrasing, and two semantic crossover operators, while a moderation oracle provides fitness guidance. Operator-level analysis shows heterogeneous behavior: lexical substitutions offer the best yield-variance trade-off, semantic-similarity crossover acts as a precise low-throughput inserter, and global rewrites exhibit high variance with elevated refusal costs. Using elite prompts evolved on LLaMA 3.1 8B, we observe practically meaningful but attenuated cross-model transfer, with toxicity roughly halving on most targets, smaller LLaMA 3.2 variants showing the strongest resistance, and some cross-architecture models retaining higher toxicity.

We examine the potential of LLMs to support domain experts in scientific writing, with a focus on abstract composition. We design an incentivized randomized controlled trial with a hypothetical conference setup where participants with relevant expertise are split into an author and reviewer pool. Inspired by methods in behavioral science, our novel incentive structure encourages authors to edit the provided abstracts to an acceptable quality for a peer-reviewed submission. Our 2x2 between-subject design expands into two dimensions: the implicit source of the provided abstract and the disclosure of it. We find authors make most edits when editing human-written abstracts compared to AI-generated abstracts without source attribution, often guided by higher perceived readability in AI generation. Upon disclosure of source information, the volume of edits converges in both source treatments. Reviewer decisions remain unaffected by the source of the abstract, but bear a significant correlation with the number of edits made. Careful stylistic edits, especially in the case of AI-generated abstracts, in the presence of source information, improve the chance of acceptance. We find that AI-generated abstracts hold potential to reach comparable levels of acceptability to human-written ones with minimal revision, and that perceptions of AI authorship, rather than objective quality, drive much of the observed editing behavior.

However, they often cause subtle yet looking-innocent deviations between normal and stego texts, posing potential security risks in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a content-preserving linguistic steganography paradigm for perfectly secure covert communication without modifying the cover text. Based on this paradigm, we introduce CLstega (\\textit{C}ontent-preserving \\textit{L}inguistic \\textit{stega}nography), a novel method that embeds secret messages through controllable distribution transformation. CLstega first applies an augmented masking strategy to locate and mask embedding positions, where MLM(masked language model)-predicted probability distributions are easily adjustable for transformation. Subsequently, a dynamic distribution steganographic coding strategy is designed to encode secret messages by deriving target distributions from the original probability distributions. To achieve this transformation, CLstega elaborately selects target words for embedding positions as labels to construct a masked sentence dataset, which is used to fine-tune the original MLM, producing a target MLM capable of directly extracting secret messages from the cover text. This approach ensures perfect security of secret messages while fully preserving the integrity of the original cover text. Experimental results show that CLstega can achieve a 100\\% extraction success rate, and outperforms existing methods in security, effectively balancing embedding capacity and security.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u5bb9\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u9690\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5CLstega\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u6362\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5d4c\u5165\u79d8\u5bc6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5b89\u5168", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u9690\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u53d8\u6362\u9690\u85cf\u79d8\u5bc6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u6587\u672c\u548c\u9690\u5199\u6587\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ea7\u751f\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5d4c\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u9690\u5199\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u539f\u59cb\u63a9\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u79d8\u5bc6\u4fe1\u606f", "result": "CLstega\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100%\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027", "conclusion": "CLstega\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027"}}

However, current agents struggle with repetitive errors and lack the ability to learn from past experiences across sessions, limiting their long-term robustness and sample efficiency. We introduce WebCoach, a model-agnostic self-evolving framework that equips web browsing agents with persistent cross-session memory, enabling improved long-term planning, reflection, and continual learning without retraining. WebCoach consists of three key components: (1) a WebCondenser, which standardizes raw navigation logs into concise summaries; (2) an External Memory Store, which organizes complete trajectories as episodic experiences; and (3) a Coach, which retrieves relevant experiences based on similarity and recency, and decides whether to inject task-specific advice into the agent via runtime hooks. This design empowers web agents to access long-term memory beyond their native context window, improving robustness in complex browsing tasks. Moreover, WebCoach achieves self-evolution by continuously curating episodic memory from new navigation trajectories, enabling agents to improve over time without retraining. Evaluations on the WebVoyager benchmark demonstrate that WebCoach consistently improves the performance of browser-use agents across three different LLM backbones. With a 38B model, it increases task success rates from 47% to 61% while reducing or maintaining the average number of steps.

Understanding such nuances is a requirement for successful natural communication, and often requires building a local world model which encodes such elements and captures the dynamics of their evolving states. However, it is not well-understood whether language models (LMs) construct or maintain a robust implicit representation of conversations. In this work, we evaluate the ability of LMs to encode and update their internal world model in dyadic conversations and test their malleability under linguistic alterations. To facilitate this, we apply seven minimal linguistic alterations to conversations sourced from popular datasets and construct two benchmarks comprising yes-no questions. We evaluate a wide range of open and closed source LMs and observe that they struggle to maintain robust accuracy. Our analysis unveils that LMs struggle to memorize crucial details, such as tracking entities under linguistic alterations to conversations. We then propose a dual-perspective interpretability framework which identifies transformer layers that are useful or harmful and highlights linguistic alterations most influenced by harmful layers, typically due to encoding spurious signals or relying on shortcuts. Inspired by these insights, we propose two layer-regularization based fine-tuning strategies that suppress the effect of the harmful layers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u4e03\u79cd\u6700\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c42\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6291\u5236\u6709\u5bb3\u5c42\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u7528\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5176\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u5065\u58ee\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8868\u793a\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6d41\u884c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5e94\u7528\u4e03\u79cd\u6700\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u662f\u975e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u7528\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u7684transformer\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5b9e\u4f53\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u7ec6\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u6709\u5bb3\u5c42\u901a\u5e38\u7531\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u6377\u5f84\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6291\u5236\u6709\u5bb3\u5c42\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A common solution is trajectory-level optimization, which treats each trajectory as a single training sample. However, this approach can be inefficient and yield misleading learning signals: it applies uniform sampling across tasks regardless of difficulty, penalizes correct intermediate actions in failed trajectories, and incurs high sample-collection costs. To address these issues, we propose STEP (Success-rate-aware Trajectory-Efficient Policy optimization), a framework that dynamically allocates sampling based on per-task success rates and performs step-level optimization. STEP maintains a smoothed success-rate record to guide adaptive trajectory resampling, allocating more effort to harder tasks. It then computes success-rate-weighted advantages and decomposes trajectories into step-level samples. Finally, it applies a step-level GRPO augmentation to refine updates for low-success tasks. Experiments on OSWorld and AndroidWorld show that STEP substantially improves sample efficiency and training stability over trajectory-level GRPO, converging faster and generalizing better under the same sampling budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "STEP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u6027\u3001\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTEP\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u6ed1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8bb0\u5f55\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\uff1b2\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u529f\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\uff1b3\uff09\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u6837\u672c\uff1b4\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7GRPO\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728OSWorld\u548cAndroidWorld\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSTEP\u76f8\u6bd4\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7GRPO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u91c7\u6837\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "STEP\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

These algorithms are widely used in political science, communication, computational social science, and computer science to estimate ideological preferences from parliamentary speeches, party manifestos, and social media. Over the past two decades, their development has closely followed broader NLP trends -- beginning with word-frequency models and most recently turning to large language models (LLMs). While this trajectory has greatly expanded the methodological toolkit, it has also produced a fragmented field that lacks systematic comparison and clear guidance for applied use. To address this gap, we identified 25 CT-IPE algorithms through a systematic literature review and conducted a manual content analysis of their modeling assumptions and development contexts. To compare them meaningfully, we introduce a conceptual framework that distinguishes how algorithms generate, capture, and aggregate textual variance. On this basis, we identify four methodological families -- word-frequency, topic modeling, word embedding, and LLM-based approaches -- and critically assess their assumptions, interpretability, scalability, and limitations. Our review offers three contributions. First, it provides a structured synthesis of two decades of algorithm development, clarifying how diverse methods relate to one another. Second, it translates these insights into practical guidance for applied researchers, highlighting trade-offs in transparency, technical requirements, and validation strategies that shape algorithm choice. Third, it emphasizes that differences in estimation outcomes across algorithms are themselves informative, underscoring the need for systematic benchmarking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5(CT-IPE)\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u533a\u5206\u56db\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "CT-IPE\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u5b66\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u653f\u6cbb\u7acb\u573a\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5448\u73b0\u788e\u7247\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u56de\u987e\u8bc6\u522b25\u4e2aCT-IPE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u533a\u5206\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u5dee\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6355\u6349\u548c\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u56db\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u8bcd\u9891\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u548cLLM\u56db\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5404\u81ea\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6743\u8861\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u672c\u8eab\u5177\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7efc\u5408\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Recent studies have confirmed the overly confident tendencies of machine-generated responses, particularly in large language models (LLMs). As these systems are increasingly embedded in ethical decision-making scenarios, it is important to understand their moral reasoning and the inherent uncertainties in building reliable AI systems. This work examines how uncertainty influences moral decisions in the classical trolley problem, analyzing responses from 32 open-source models and 9 distinct moral dimensions. We first find that variance in model confidence is greater across models than within moral dimensions, suggesting that moral uncertainty is predominantly shaped by model architecture and training method. To quantify uncertainty, we measure binary entropy as a linear combination of total entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information. To examine its effects, we introduce stochasticity into models via \"dropout\" at inference time. Our findings show that our mechanism increases total entropy, mainly through a rise in mutual information, while conditional entropy remains largely unchanged. Moreover, this mechanism significantly improves human-LLM moral alignment, with correlations in mutual information and alignment score shifts. Our results highlight the potential to better align model-generated decisions and human preferences by deliberately modulating uncertainty and reducing LLMs' confidence in morally complex scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u679032\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7535\u8f66\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9053\u5fb7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u4e8e\u9053\u5fb7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u672c\u8eab\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u603b\u71b5\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u53c2\u4e0e\u9053\u5fb7\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u673a\u5668\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u4e8e\u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u7535\u8f66\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5206\u679032\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u6db5\u76d69\u4e2a\u9053\u5fb7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e8c\u5143\u71b5\uff08\u603b\u71b5\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u548c\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff09\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7'dropout'\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u4e8e\u9053\u5fb7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5185\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u6027\u540e\u603b\u71b5\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u800c\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d8\uff1b\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b-LLM\u9053\u5fb7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u610f\u8c03\u8282\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9053\u5fb7\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9053\u5fb7AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Recent advances use screenshot-based document encoding with fine-grained late interaction, significantly improving retrieval performance. However, retrievers are still trained with coarse global relevance labels, without revealing which regions support the match. As a result, retrievers tend to rely on surface-level cues and struggle to capture implicit semantic connections, hindering their ability to handle non-extractive queries. To alleviate this problem, we propose a \\textbf{A}ttention-\\textbf{G}rounded \\textbf{RE}triever \\textbf{E}nhancement (AGREE) framework. AGREE leverages cross-modal attention from multimodal large language models as proxy local supervision to guide the identification of relevant document regions. During training, AGREE combines local signals with the global signals to jointly optimize the retriever, enabling it to learn not only whether documents match, but also which content drives relevance. Experiments on the challenging ViDoRe V2 benchmark show that AGREE significantly outperforms the global-supervision-only baseline. Quantitative and qualitative analyses further demonstrate that AGREE promotes deeper alignment between query terms and document regions, moving beyond surface-level matching toward more accurate and interpretable retrieval.

In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-G\u00f6del Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that Live-SWE-agent can achieve an impressive solve rate of 75.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing open-source software agents and approaching the performance of the best proprietary solution.
