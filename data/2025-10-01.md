### [1] [Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional Regeneration in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25220)
*Eduard Kapelko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过循环消融方法测试大语言模型中欺骗行为是否可被局部移除，发现欺骗行为具有高度韧性，每次消融后都能通过对抗训练恢复，但会导致语言性能逐渐下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型中的不良行为（如欺骗）是局部可移除的功能，还是与模型核心认知能力深度交织的问题，这对模型安全性和可控性至关重要。

Method: 采用循环消融方法，结合稀疏自编码器、定向消融和对抗训练，在DistilGPT-2模型上尝试消除欺骗概念。

Result: 欺骗行为具有高度韧性，模型通过对抗训练持续恢复其欺骗行为（功能再生），但每次神经外科手术都导致语言性能逐渐衰减，困惑度持续上升。

Conclusion: 复杂概念是分布式和纠缠的，通过机制可解释性进行直接模型编辑存在局限性。

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

### [2] [From Internal Representations to Text Quality: A Geometric Approach to LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25359)
*Viacheslav Yusupov,Danil Maksimov,Ameliia Alaeva,Anna Vasileva,Anna Antipina,Tatyana Zaitseva,Alina Ermilova,Evgeny Burnaev,Egor Shvetsov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过证明内部模型表示的几何特性可作为评估生成文本质量的可靠代理，将大语言模型的内部分析与外部分析方法联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 桥接大语言模型的内部分析和外部分析方法，寻找无需人工标注数据集的文本质量评估方法。

Method: 验证了一组度量指标，包括最大可解释方差、有效秩、内在维度、MAUVE分数和Schatten范数，在不同LLM层中测量这些几何特性。

Result: 发现内在维度和有效秩可作为文本自然度和质量的通用评估指标，不同模型基于这些几何特性对来自不同来源的文本进行一致排序。

Conclusion: 这些几何度量反映了文本的内在特性而非模型特定的人工产物，实现了无需参考的文本质量评估，为自动化评估流程提供了实际优势。

Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

### [3] [Generative Value Conflicts Reveal LLM Priorities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25369)
*Andy Liu,Kshitish Ghate,Mona Diab,Daniel Fried,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConflictScope是一个评估LLM在价值冲突中如何优先排序不同价值的自动化管道，通过生成价值冲突场景来测试模型的价值偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐数据集缺乏价值冲突场景，需要评估LLM在价值冲突时的优先排序能力。

Method: 自动生成价值冲突场景，使用LLM编写的用户提示来测试目标模型，通过自由文本响应评估价值排序。

Result: 在开放性评估中，模型从保护性价值转向个人价值；系统提示中的详细价值排序可将对齐度提高14%。

Conclusion: 系统提示能适度改善LLM在价值冲突中的对齐行为，强调了评估价值优先排序的重要性。

Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

### [4] [From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think Critically](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25409)
*Qiyao Ma,Yunsheng Shi,Hongtao Tian,Chao Wang,Weiming Chang,Ting Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM)，通过句子级思考监督增强奖励模型的批判性思维能力，解决开放域问答中RLVR难以验证正确性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR在复杂任务如开放域问答中面临验证困难，现有方法过度关注与支持文档的语义对齐，导致模型过度依赖外部知识而缺乏批判性评估能力。

Method: TRM将奖励建模构建为忠实性、推理和正确性评估的序列：首先评估每个答案句子与支持文档的忠实性，然后通过推理步骤评估句子级正确性。

Result: 实验表明TRM显著提高了错误句子的识别能力，将TRM融入策略优化在答案正确性和实用性方面都带来了显著提升。

Conclusion: TRM通过结构化奖励建模过程，有效增强了模型对外部和内部知识的批判性评估能力，在复杂任务中实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

### [5] [Emotion-Aligned Generation in Diffusion Text to Speech Models via Preference-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25416)
*Jiacheng Shi,Hongfei Du,Yangfan He,Y. Alicia Hong,Ye Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EASPO是一个后训练框架，通过扩散TTS在中间去噪步骤中对齐细粒度情感偏好，实现可控的情感塑造。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的情感文本转语音方法依赖粗粒度标签或代理分类器，只能获得话语级别的反馈，无法实现细粒度的情感控制。

Method: 引入EASPO框架，包括时间条件模型EASPM来评分噪声中间语音状态并自动构建偏好对，通过优化生成来匹配这些逐步偏好。

Result: 实验表明在表达性和自然度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EASPO能够有效提升情感文本转语音的表达质量和可控性。

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving
intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

### [6] [SimulRAG: Simulator-based RAG for Grounding LLMs in Long-form Scientific QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25459)
*Haozhou Xu,Dongxia Wu,Matteo Chinazzi,Ruijia Niu,Rose Yu,Yi-An Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SimulRAG框架，通过科学模拟器检索来减少LLM在长格式科学问答中的幻觉问题，使用不确定性估计和模拟器边界评估来验证和更新答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在长格式科学问答中容易产生幻觉，而科学模拟器作为验证假设的重要工具，可以提升答案的可信度，但现有RAG方法无法直接应用于科学模拟器检索。

Method: 提出SimulRAG框架，包括通用模拟器检索接口（文本与数值模态转换）和基于不确定性估计与模拟器边界评估（UE+SBA）的声明级生成方法。

Result: 在气候科学和流行病学基准测试中，SimulRAG在信息量上比传统RAG基线提高30.4%，在事实性上提高16.3%。UE+SBA进一步提升了声明级生成的效率和质量。

Conclusion: SimulRAG通过科学模拟器检索有效减少了LLM的幻觉问题，提升了长格式科学问答的准确性和可信度，为科学领域的RAG应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

Method: 使用定量分析方法，基于1.9K篇NLP论文摘要、4.9K位作者贡献者和7.8K条人工标注的贡献句子数据集，结合基准结果进行分析。

Result: 建立了非洲NLP贡献数据集和持续更新的NLP进展追踪网站，为追踪非洲NLP研究趋势提供了强大的分析工具。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is undergoing constant transformation, as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving daily breakthroughs in research and
practice. In this regard, tracking the progress of NLP research and
automatically analyzing the contributions of research papers provides key
insights into the nature of the field and the researchers. This study explores
the progress of African NLP (AfricaNLP) by asking (and answering) basic
research questions such as: i) How has the nature of NLP evolved over the last
two decades?, ii) What are the contributions of AfricaNLP papers?, and iii)
Which individuals and organizations (authors, affiliated institutions, and
funding bodies) have been involved in the development of AfricaNLP? We
quantitatively examine the contributions of AfricaNLP research using 1.9K NLP
paper abstracts, 4.9K author contributors, and 7.8K human-annotated
contribution sentences (AfricaNLPContributions) along with benchmark results.
Our dataset and continuously existing NLP progress tracking website provide a
powerful lens for tracing AfricaNLP research trends and hold potential for
generating data-driven literature surveys.

### [8] [Not Wrong, But Untrue: LLM Overconfidence in Document-Based Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25498)
*Nick Hagar,Wilma Agustianto,Nicholas Diakopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估ChatGPT、Gemini和NotebookLM在新闻报道任务中的幻觉问题，发现30%输出包含幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率是NotebookLM的三倍，主要问题是解释性过度自信而非虚构实体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在新闻编辑室工作流程中的使用风险，特别是对新闻核心实践（来源、归属、准确性）的威胁。

Method: 使用300个与TikTok诉讼和政策相关的文档语料库，评估三个工具在报告式任务中的表现，通过改变提示特异性和上下文大小，使用分类法在句子级别标注幻觉类型和严重程度。

Result: 30%的模型输出包含至少一个幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率约为40%，是NotebookLM（13%）的三倍。大多数错误涉及解释性过度自信，模型添加了未经支持的来源特征描述，并将归因意见转化为一般陈述。

Conclusion: LLMs与新闻业存在根本的认识论不匹配：新闻业要求每个主张都有明确来源，而LLMs无论证据支持如何都会生成权威性文本。建议新闻业特定的幻觉分类扩展，并需要能够强制准确归属而非优化流畅性的架构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

### [9] [Beyond WER: Probing Whisper's Sub-token Decoder Across Diverse Language Resource Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25516)
*Siyu Liang,Nicolas Ballier,Gina-Anne Levow,Richard Wright*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对Whisper多语言ASR模型的解码器进行细粒度分析，发现高资源语言在正确token排名、置信度、预测熵和候选多样性方面表现更好，而低资源语言在这些指标上表现较差且显示出不同的子token使用模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索端到端多语言ASR模型内部机制，特别是在不同语言间的公平性和有效性方面，因为现有研究对这些模型的内部工作原理了解不足。

Method: 通过追踪beam搜索路径，捕获子token假设及其相关概率，使用PCA和t-SNE分析子token使用模式。

Result: 高资源语言在正确token排名、置信度、预测熵和候选多样性方面表现更好；低资源语言在这些指标上表现较差，且显示出受类型学影响的子token使用聚类模式。

Conclusion: 子token探测揭示了被聚合错误率掩盖的系统性解码差异，为改善语音技术不平衡发展提供了针对性干预方向。

Abstract: While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve
remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline,
particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain
underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's
multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription
across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam
search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities.
Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of
the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive
entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare
worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in
sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.
This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by
aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate
the imbalanced development of speech technology.

TL;DR: MixtureVitae是一个开源预训练语料库，采用风险缓解策略构建，结合公共领域和宽松许可文本，在保持法律安全的同时提供强大的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在最小化法律风险，同时提供强大的模型性能，减少对无差别网络爬取的依赖。

Method: 采用多阶段管道进行许可感知过滤、安全和质量筛选，以及领域感知混合，结合公共领域文本、宽松许可内容、政府作品和欧盟TDM合格来源。

Result: 在130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B参数规模的实验中，MixtureVitae训练的模型在标准基准测试中始终优于其他宽松许可数据集，在数学/代码任务上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 以宽松许可优先、风险缓解的数据为训练有能力的LLM提供了实用且法律上缓解的基础，在不牺牲竞争力的同时减少对无差别网络爬取的依赖。

Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize
legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a
risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively
licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions
(e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted
instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail
a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and
quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

### [11] [Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25532)
*Victor Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DINCO方法，通过评估LLM的易受暗示性偏差来校准语言模型的置信度估计，结合生成器-验证器不一致性来改善置信度校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的置信度分数存在错校准问题，经常在低准确率实例上报告高置信度，这损害了信任和安全性。研究发现这种过度自信源于LLM对信息量较少的声明的易受暗示性。

Method: 引入Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO)，通过让模型在多个自生成的干扰项上独立表达置信度，并基于总置信度进行归一化来估计和校正易受暗示性偏差。同时利用生成器-验证器不一致性，将归一化验证器置信度与基于一致性的生成器置信度估计相结合。

Result: DINCO提供了更不饱和、更可用的置信度估计。在10次推理调用下，DINCO的性能优于100次调用下的自一致性方法，表明进一步采样无法弥合DINCO与基线之间的差距。

Conclusion: DINCO通过整合跨采样生成和跨不兼容声明验证的互补一致性维度，有效改善了LLM置信度校准，提供了更可靠的置信度估计。

Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

*Zhiling Ye,Yun Yue,Haowen Wang,Xudong Han,Jiadi Jiang,Cheng Wei,Lei Fan,Jiaxin Liang,Shuowen Zhang,Ji Li,Chunxiao Guo,Jian Wang,Peng Wei,Jinjie Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自我奖励和评分标准的强化学习框架，用于提升大语言模型在开放端推理任务中的性能，通过在HealthBench数据集上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实世界部署大语言模型时，开放端评估至关重要。研究发现使用模型自身作为评分者并生成基于评分标准的奖励信号可以显著提升推理性能，同时训练后的模型也会成为更强的评分者。

Method: 引入了自我奖励的基于评分标准的强化学习框架，这是一个轻量级框架，能够实现更快、更资源高效的训练，同时超越基线方法。在Qwen3-32B模型上，仅使用4000个样本的HealthBench Easy子集进行训练就足够获得超越GPT-5在HealthBench Hard上的性能。

Result: 该方法在HealthBench基准测试中表现出色，训练后的模型在推理性能上显著提升，并且能够超越GPT-5等强大模型。加入少量教师评分数据可以进一步提升性能较弱的模型的表现。

Conclusion: 自我奖励的基于评分标准的强化学习框架为开放端推理任务提供了一种高效且有效的训练方法，能够在资源有限的情况下实现优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

TL;DR: PB-RLSVR框架通过使用高性能英语LLM作为枢轴模型生成参考响应，基于语义等价性奖励多语言模型，显著缩小了英语与其他语言在推理能力上的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习虽然提升了大型语言模型的推理能力，但这些进步主要局限于英语，导致不同语言之间存在显著的性能差异。

Method: 使用高性能英语LLM作为枢轴模型生成参考响应，通过基于嵌入和机器翻译的跨语言语义奖励函数，奖励多语言模型与英语参考响应的语义等价性。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-32B上分别实现了16.41%和10.17%的多语言性能平均提升，显著优于传统PPO基线。

Conclusion: PB-RLSVR提供了一种强大且数据高效的方法，能够构建真正具备多语言推理能力的智能体。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

Motivation: 研究儿童在4岁前的空主语阶段频繁省略主语的现象，特别是儿童如何混淆指令句和陈述句，这促进了临时空主语语法的形成。

Method: 使用改进的变分学习器（Yang, 2012）进行模拟，该学习器适用于超集-子集语言，通过新的计算参数测量误解并将其整合到强制主语语法学习模型中。

Result: 模拟结果支持Orfitelli和Hyams的假设，证实了儿童对空主语指令句的误解确实会促进临时空主语语法的形成。

Conclusion: 本研究为将计算模型整合到语法习得研究中提供了一个框架，同时考虑了其他关键的发育因素。

Abstract: The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4
years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and
Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS
utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a
temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to
measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of
obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the
Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our
simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study
outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of
grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

*Colten DiIanni,Daniel Deutsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP)，一种新的机器翻译段级元评估指标，通过使用成对差异而非原始分数来解决先前基于Pearson's ρ和Kendall's τ的元评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决先前基于Pearson's ρ和Kendall's τ的机器翻译元评估方法的局限性，提供更稳健的评分分布理解。

Method: PDP是一种基于相关性的指标，利用成对差异而非原始分数，从所有段中提取信息以更稳健地理解评分分布，并使用段间成对差异将全局Pearson细化为段内评分比较。

Result: 在WMT'24共享任务上的分析显示，PDP能正确排序哨兵评估指标，并且比先前工作更好地与人类错误权重对齐。噪声注入分析证明了PDP对随机噪声、段偏差和系统偏差的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PDP是一种有效的段级元评估指标，对随机噪声、段偏差和系统偏差具有鲁棒性，但对外部极端值敏感。

Abstract: This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究小规模视觉语言模型在幽默和浪漫风格上的数据效率对齐，探索模型性能极限和所需最少偏好数据量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉语言模型在零样本设置下难以生成特定风格（如幽默、浪漫）的图像描述，而获取偏好数据成本高昂，限制了模型能力的充分探索

Method: 研究小规模视觉语言模型的数据效率对齐方法，通过少量偏好数据将模型对齐到幽默和浪漫风格

Result: 定义了模型性能极限，确定了实现风格饱和所需的最少偏好数据量

Conclusion: 该方法为基准测试视觉语言模型在风格化图像描述任务中的能力和局限性提供了有效途径

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

*Tianlang Chen,Minkai Xu,Jure Leskovec,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RFG方法，无需显式过程奖励即可指导扩散大语言模型的推理轨迹，通过参数化过程奖励为增强模型和参考模型的似然比，在数学推理和代码生成任务上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型在解决复杂问题时需要逐步指导推理过程，但传统方法需要为每个中间步骤提供密集标注的过程奖励，这在dLLMs中具有挑战性，因为生成是任意顺序的且中间状态是部分掩码的句子。

Method: 提出奖励自由指导(RFG)，将过程奖励参数化为增强dLLM和参考dLLM的对数似然比，增强模型可以通过现成的经过强化学习或监督微调的dLLM轻松获得。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，RFG在所有任务和模型类型上都取得了显著改进，准确率提升高达9.2%。

Conclusion: RFG是一个通用的无需训练框架，可以在不依赖外部奖励模型的情况下扩展测试时推理能力。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

*Takashi Furuya,Maarten V. de Hoop,Matti Lassas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer架构作为概率测度间映射的数学特性，证明了Transformer可以表示满足特定条件的测度间映射，并且能够逼近Vlasov方程的解映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了从数学上统一分析Transformer架构的表达能力，研究其作为概率测度间映射的特性，这有助于理解Wasserstein正则性、泛化界限以及交互粒子系统的平均场极限分析。

Method: 将Transformer建模为概率测度间的映射，通过前推操作表示上下文映射，分析这类映射的数学特性，包括支撑基数保持性和Fr\'echet导数的正则部分一致连续性。

Result: 完全刻画了能够通过Transformer表示的测度间映射的特性，证明了Transformer可以普遍逼近具有任何连续上下文映射的表示，并且测度理论的自注意力具有确保无限深度平均场测度理论Transformer可识别为Vlasov流的特性。

Conclusion: Transformer架构能够表示满足特定数学条件的测度间映射，特别是可以逼近Vlasov方程的解映射，这为理解Transformer的数学基础和在物理系统建模中的应用提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个大规模、实时的数据集和计算框架，用于系统性研究新闻媒体在选择和框架偏见方面的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流新闻机构不仅通过发布文章直接影响公众认知，还通过选择报道哪些话题以及如何框架这些话题来塑造公众观点，但大规模测量这些微妙形式的媒体偏见仍具挑战性。

Method: 整合大型语言模型与可扩展的近实时新闻抓取，提取结构化注释（包括政治倾向、语气、主题、文章类型和主要事件），每天处理数百篇文章。

Result: 在多个层面（句子、文章和出版商）量化这些报道维度，建立了一个可复用的方法论，并提供了交互式网络平台便于数据探索。

Conclusion: 这些贡献为大规模研究媒体偏见建立了可重复的方法论，为未来研究提供了实证资源，并展示了如何揭示新闻报道和偏见中的有见地模式。

Abstract: Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

*David Beauchemin,Pier-Luc Veilleux,Richard Khoury,Johanna-Pascale Roy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QFrBLiMP是一个魁北克法语语言最小对基准语料库，包含1,761对最小对，用于评估LLMs在魁北克法语语法现象上的语言知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在魁北克法语主要语法现象上的语言知识能力，并与人类表现进行比较。

Method: 通过手动修改魁北克政府官方在线资源的句子创建最小对，由12名魁北克法语母语者标注语法性，比较LLMs与人类在语法判断上的能力。

Result: 模型语法能力随规模增长而提升，但出现明显的难度层次。所有模型在需要深层语义理解的现象上持续失败，与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: LLMs在魁北克法语语法理解上存在局限性，特别是在需要深层语义处理的任务中，与人类能力有明显差距。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal
Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of
LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of
1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these
minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from
an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution.
Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the
sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used
to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different
LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher
probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.
We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear
hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on
phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical
limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these
specific tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出基准和谐度概念，衡量模型在基准测试各子领域表现的均匀性，强调高和谐度基准能提供更可靠的评估结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试的可靠性对模型能力评估和开发方向至关重要，当前基准可能存在某些子领域过度影响总体准确率的问题。

Method: 从分布视角研究基准可靠性，引入基准和谐度指标，在19个多项选择基准和5个模型家族上计算和谐度的均值-方差平面。

Result: 分析显示不和谐的基准会产生误导性结果，如ARC-Easy基准中生物学概念问题过度主导，掩盖了地理、物理等其他重要子领域。

Conclusion: 建议在报告准确率的同时报告和谐度，将评估从简单的性能平均转向更稳健、分布可靠的性能测量。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

TL;DR: BiasUnlearn是一个新颖的语言模型去偏见框架，通过双路径遗忘机制协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，同时通过对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换防止偏见极性反转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数修改去偏见方法显著降低文本连贯性和任务准确性等核心能力，而基于提示的方法仅对预定义触发词有效，无法解决模型参数中深层嵌入的刻板印象关联。

Method: 提出BiasUnlearn框架，采用双路径遗忘机制：协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，使用对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换防止偏见极性反转。

Result: 在多个语言模型和各种评估基准上的广泛实验表明，BiasUnlearn在减轻语言模型偏见的同时保留语言建模能力方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 去偏见权重可在模型变体间迁移，证实偏见表示在预训练期间固化并在微调阶段持续存在。

Abstract: Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups
in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent
parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core
capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based
debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address
deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper,
we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves
targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating
stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias
polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping.
We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various
evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing
methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling
capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are
transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become
entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LD-MoLE方法，用可学习的动态路由机制替代传统TopK路由，实现自适应、token依赖和分层专家分配，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖传统TopK路由，需要仔细的超参数调优，且为每个token分配固定数量的专家，限制了模型的灵活性。

Method: 使用可微分路由函数和闭式解替代不可微分的TopK选择，允许模型自适应地确定每层每个token激活的专家数量，并引入分析稀疏性控制目标。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B和Llama-3.2-3B模型上的广泛实验表明，LD-MoLE在多样化基准测试中获得了最高的平均分数。

Conclusion: LD-MoLE不仅实现了优越性能，还展示了学习token依赖和分层专家分配的能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

TL;DR: 提出评估数学原子能力的新范式，将数学能力分解为领域特定能力和逻辑能力两个维度，通过实验探索不同原子能力之间的相互影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型主要依赖扩大训练数据规模，但无法确定模型是否真正掌握数学概念和推理原理，还是仅仅记忆训练数据。受人类将复杂问题分解为基本原子能力的启发，需要新的评估方法来理解模型的数学认知能力。

Method: 将原子能力分为两个维度：(1) 四个主要数学领域的特定能力：代数、几何、分析和拓扑；(2) 不同层次的逻辑能力：概念理解、使用形式数学语言的前向多步推理、反例驱动的后向推理。为每个原子能力单元构建相应的训练和评估数据集。

Result: 在先进模型上的评估和实验结果显示，模型在各种原子能力上表现出不同的性能，原子能力之间存在有趣的相互作用。这些发现为模型认知提供了新的见解。

Conclusion: 将数学智能解耦为原子组件具有重要意义，为模型认知提供新见解，并指导训练策略向更高效、可迁移和认知基础的"原子思维"范式发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, we argue that current large-scale
reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse
mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about
whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles
or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down
complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by
this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic
capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)
field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,
geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different
levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with
formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose
corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,
and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities
influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific
atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show
many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances
of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic
capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical
intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model
cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more
efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic
thinking".

Method: 使用实体感知控制码引导可控生成，提供ICL和前缀调优两种变体：ICL确保与底层去识别系统一致的隐私级别，前缀调优采用自定义掩码策略和损失函数支持可扩展的高质量生成。

Result: 在法学和临床数据集上的实验表明，该方法在隐私保护和实用性之间实现了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为敏感领域的合成文本生成提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this
work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text
generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In
Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes
to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or
prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the
underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,
high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and
utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text
generation in sensitive domains.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的AI心理咨询采用一次性生成方法，导致治疗忠实度低且无法捕捉每个回应的决策逻辑。

Method: CATCH框架包含：1）渐进式对话合成策略，从客户自述中提取目标、资源和解决方案，组织成结构化大纲并逐步生成阶段对齐的咨询对话；2）记忆驱动动态规划思维模式，整合记忆增强、全局规划和策略推理；3）协作多智能体优化器，为每个对话轮次附加显式思维链。

Result: 大量实验和人工评估表明，CATCH显著提升了AI心理咨询的忠实度和逻辑连贯性。

Conclusion: CATCH框架有效解决了现有AI心理咨询方法在治疗忠实度和决策逻辑捕捉方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have
shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time
generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low
therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind
each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework
designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy
fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which
extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes
them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned
counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each
response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that
integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a
collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit
chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human
evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical
coherence in AI counseling.

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发多语言、细粒度的希望语音检测模型做出了贡献，可用于增强积极内容审核和培养支持性在线社区，同时讨论了低资源语言检测的挑战和改进泛化能力的潜力。

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical
task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present
a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple
languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based
models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa, to detect and categorize hope speech into
three distinct classes: Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, and Unrealistic Hope.
Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the
PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all
languages. We compare our results with existing models, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms
of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in
low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This
work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech
detection models, which can be applied to enhance positive content moderation
and foster supportive online communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TruthRL是一个基于强化学习的框架，直接优化LLMs的真实性，通过三元奖励区分正确答案、幻觉和弃权，显著减少幻觉并提高真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在优化准确性时会放大幻觉，而鼓励弃权的方法又过于保守，牺牲正确答案，这两种极端都损害了真实性。

Method: 使用GRPO实现TruthRL，采用三元奖励机制，激励模型不仅提供正确答案，还能在不确定时弃权。

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中，TruthRL相比普通RL显著减少幻觉28.9%，提高真实性21.1%，在各种骨干模型下表现一致。

Conclusion: TruthRL在准确性和真实性方面都表现出色，强调了学习目标设计对于开发真实LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究比较了基于深度神经网络(DNN)嵌入和大型语言模型(LLMs)的抑郁症检测方法，发现LLMs在分类性能上优于DNN模型，特别是在少数族裔群体中表现更好，且性别偏见较小，但种族偏见问题仍然存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是调查语言模型在自动化抑郁症检测中的算法偏见问题，特别关注性别和种族/民族方面的社会人口差异，旨在比较不同方法在性能和公平性方面的表现。

Method: 使用DAIC-WOZ临床访谈语料库，比较DNN嵌入模型和LLMs的少样本学习方法。对DNN模型应用公平性感知损失函数，对LLMs探索不同提示框架和样本数量的上下文学习。

Result: LLMs在抑郁症分类上优于DNN模型，特别是在西班牙裔参与者中表现更好。LLMs的性别偏见较小，但种族差异仍然存在。最差组损失函数在DNN模型中实现了性能与公平性的更好平衡。

Conclusion: LLMs在抑郁症检测中表现出更好的性能和更低的性别偏见，但种族偏见问题仍然具有挑战性。公平性感知技术对DNN模型有效，而提示策略对LLMs的种族偏见缓解效果有限。

Abstract: This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for
automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities
related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks
(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large
language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical
interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz
(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to
DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot
counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based
models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups
such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared
to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among
fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the
worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing
demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.
In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but
performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps
mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of
shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,
neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively
reduces disparities.

Conclusion: 该研究为未来在低资源语言和专门知识任务方面的大语言模型研究与发展提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
their performance in domain-specific applications and non-English languages
remains less explored. This study introduces a novel Romanian-language dataset
for multiple-choice biology questions, carefully curated to assess LLM
comprehension and reasoning capabilities in scientific contexts. Containing
approximately 14,000 questions, the dataset provides a comprehensive resource
for evaluating and improving LLM performance in biology.
  We benchmark several popular LLMs, analyzing their accuracy, reasoning
patterns, and ability to understand domain-specific terminology and linguistic
nuances. Additionally, we perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate the
impact of prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and other optimization techniques on
model performance. Our findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs in handling specialized knowledge tasks in low-resource languages,
offering valuable insights for future research and development.

Motivation: 现有的基于图的方法在全局语义理解任务中缺乏检索机制、主题特异性，且推理成本高昂。

Method: ReTAG是一个检索增强、主题增强的图框架，构建主题特定子图并检索相关摘要用于回答生成。

Result: 实验表明ReTAG在提高回答质量的同时，相比基线方法显著减少了推理时间。

Conclusion: ReTAG框架有效解决了全局语义理解中的关键挑战，为多跳推理任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in question answering have led to substantial progress in
tasks such as multi-hop reasoning. However, global sensemaking-answering
questions by synthesizing information from an entire corpus remains a
significant challenge. A prior graph-based approach to global sensemaking lacks
retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incurs high inference costs. To
address these limitations, we propose ReTAG, a Retrieval-Enhanced,
Topic-Augmented Graph framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and
retrieves the relevant summaries for response generation. Experiments show that
ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time
compared to the baseline. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RLVR的大规模推理模型存在"过度思考"问题，生成了过长的推理路径却没有性能提升。现有的长度惩罚方法由于轨迹级奖励与token级优化的不匹配而失败。

Method: 提出了DECS框架，包括：(1)首创的解耦token级奖励机制，精确惩罚冗余token；(2)新颖的课程批量调度策略，平衡效率与效果。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，DECS实现了推理token减少超过50%的显著效果，同时保持甚至提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: DECS证明可以在不损害模型基本推理能力的前提下，大幅提升推理效率，解决了过度思考问题。

Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

TL;DR: 提出了两种视觉语言模型解释质量评估指标——视觉保真度和对比性，通过质量评分帮助用户在看不到视觉上下文时更好地判断模型预测的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户无法看到视觉上下文时，VLM的解释可能误导用户相信错误的预测。需要评估解释质量来防止对模型预测的过度依赖。

Method: 提出视觉保真度（衡量解释对视觉上下文的忠实程度）和对比性（衡量解释区分模型预测与合理替代方案的能力）两个质量评分函数。在A-OKVQA和VizWiz任务上进行评估，并与用户研究结合。

Result: 质量评分函数比现有解释质量指标与模型正确性更相关。用户研究表明，显示质量评分可将用户预测VLM正确性的准确率提高11.1%，错误相信错误预测的比例降低15.4%。

Conclusion: 解释质量评分有助于促进对VLM预测的适当依赖，提高用户判断模型可靠性的能力。

Abstract: When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

Motivation: 大语言模型经常虚构科学事实，严重影响其可信度。需要超越二元事实性的细粒度评估基准。

Method: 创建ReFACT基准，包含1001个专家标注的科学问答对，每个实例都有正确回答和虚构版本，标注了精确的错误范围和错误类型。

Result: 评估9个最先进的LLMs，发现性能有限（约50%准确率）。即使是GPT-4o等顶级模型也难以区分事实与虚构的科学答案。

Conclusion: 需要细粒度、人工验证的基准来检测和纠正领域特定语境中的科学虚构问题，这对LLM-as-judge评估范式的可靠性提出了担忧。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently confabulate scientific facts,severely
undermining their trustworthiness. Addressing this challenge requires
benchmarks that go beyond binary factuality and enable fine-grained evaluation.
We introduce \textbf{ReFACT} (\textit{Reddit False And Correct Texts}), a
benchmark of 1,001 expert-annotated question--answer pairs spanning diverse
scientific domains for the detection of scientific confabulation. Each instance
includes both a scientifically correct answer and a non-factual counterpart
annotated with \textbf{precise error spans and error-types}. ReFACT enables
multi-stage evaluation: (1) confabulation detection, (2) fine-grained error
localization, and (3) correction. We benchmark 9 state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing limited performance ($\sim$50\% accuracy). Even top models such as
GPT-4o fail to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers,
raising concerns about the reliability of \textit{LLM-as-judge} evaluation

address this, we experiment with multiple training strategies, including
synthetic noise augmentation and SpecAugment, and evaluate performance across a

TL;DR: 提出了RoleConflictBench基准来评估LLMs在角色冲突情境中的上下文敏感性，发现LLMs存在显著的社会角色偏见而非情境敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在人类决策中影响力增强，需要理解它们在复杂社会情境中的行为。角色冲突代表了需要上下文敏感性的模糊社会困境。

Method: 使用三阶段流程生成超过13K个现实角色冲突场景，涵盖65个角色，系统变化期望和情境紧急程度，分析10个不同LLMs的选择。

Result: LLMs对上下文线索的敏感性不足，决策主要由强大的内在社会角色偏见主导，表现出对家庭和职业角色的偏好，以及男性角色和亚伯拉罕宗教的优先选择。

Conclusion: LLMs在角色冲突中表现出显著的社会角色偏见而非情境敏感性，这对其在复杂社会决策中的应用提出了重要警示。

Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏评估文本个性化质量的专门指标，研究者通常依赖多个大语言模型进行元评估，这会因模型内部偏见而增加成本。

Method: 开发了PerQ方法，这是一种计算高效的文本个性化质量评估指标。

Result: 通过大语言模型与小语言模型生成能力的案例研究，证明了PerQ指标在研究中的实用性。

Conclusion: PerQ方法有效减少了资源浪费，为文本个性化质量评估提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆增强代理依赖预定义指令和工具进行记忆更新，但语言模型难以确定存储哪些信息、如何结构化以及何时更新，导致记忆构建不优和信息丢失。

Method: 提出强化学习框架Mem-alpha，构建专门训练数据集，代理处理顺序信息块，学习提取和存储相关内容并更新记忆系统，奖励信号基于下游问答准确性。

Result: Mem-alpha在经验评估中显著优于现有记忆增强代理基线，尽管仅在30k令牌长度实例上训练，但能泛化到超过400k令牌的序列，超过训练长度的13倍。

Conclusion: Mem-alpha框架有效解决了复杂记忆系统管理问题，展示了强大的泛化能力和记忆构建优化效果。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows,
necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding.
Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions
and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to
determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update
it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in
suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose
Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively
manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also
construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn
interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to
teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential
information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update
the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering
accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory
construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we
design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic
components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over
existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on
instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable
generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training
length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

Motivation: 传统MoE模型中Softmax作为路由器函数被视为标准实践，但其必要性从未被质疑。作者发现MoE与Nadaraya-Watson回归具有相同数学形式，希望基于此提出更优的路由器设计。

Method: 提出KERN路由器函数，基于FFN风格设计，使用ReLU激活和ℓ2归一化，作为Softmax的替代方案，能够泛化Sigmoid和Softmax路由器。

Result: 在MoE和LLM上的综合实验验证了所提FFN风格路由器函数的有效性。

Conclusion: KERN路由器在零额外成本下能够有效替代传统Softmax路由器，提供更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$
as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that
has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely
regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains
an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this
work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe
that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson
regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression,
where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer.
Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost}
Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function,
as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router
generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers.
\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN
implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and
$\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive
experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style
router function \methodNorm.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多种替代架构（如xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型、扩散模型和对抗学习）在序列标注任务中的表现，发现这些在简单设置中表现良好的模型在跨语言和复杂结构化任务中泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练Transformer编码器在序列标注中占主导地位，但一些替代架构在语言建模中显示出潜力，却很少应用于序列标注任务，尤其是在复杂任务上。

Method: 研究多种替代架构（xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型、扩散模型、对抗学习）在不同结构复杂性、标签空间和标记依赖性的标注任务中的适应性，并进行多语言评估。

Result: 发现在简单设置中观察到的强性能并不总是能很好地跨语言或数据集泛化，也无法扩展到更复杂的结构化任务。

Conclusion: 替代架构在序列标注任务中的表现受任务复杂性和语言多样性的影响，需要更全面的评估来理解其适用性。

Abstract: Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence
labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured
state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown
promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and
mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt
across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token
dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the
strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always
generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more
complex structured tasks.

### [43] [Reliability Crisis of Reference-free Metrics for Grammatical Error Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25961)
*Takumi Goto,Yusuke Sakai,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对四种无参考语法纠错评估指标（SOME、Scribendi、IMPARA和LLM指标）的对抗攻击策略，证明这些攻击系统能超越当前最优方法，揭示了现有评估方法的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考语法纠错评估指标虽然与人工评估相关性高，但无法有效评估旨在获取不合理高分的对抗系统，这会误导用户选择不合适的GEC系统，影响自动评估的可靠性。

Method: 针对四种无参考评估指标设计了对抗攻击策略，开发了能够获取不合理高分的对抗系统。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的对抗系统在四种评估指标上均超越了当前最优方法，成功获取了不合理的评估高分。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了开发更鲁棒的语法纠错评估方法的必要性，现有评估指标容易受到对抗攻击的影响。

Abstract: Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have
achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not
designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high
scores. The existence of such systems undermines the reliability of automatic
evaluation, as it can mislead users in selecting appropriate GEC systems. In
this study, we propose adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free
metrics: SOME, Scribendi, IMPARA, and LLM-based metrics, and demonstrate that
our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings
highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

TL;DR: RAGferee方法将问答数据集转化为偏好对，训练专门针对RAG场景的奖励模型，在ContextualJudgeBench上超越现有大型通用奖励模型15.5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型基于通用偏好数据训练，在RAG场景中难以准确评估回答的忠实性、相关性、适当拒绝、完整性和简洁性，缺乏专门的RAG偏好数据集和模型

Method: 提出RAGferee方法，将问答数据集重新构建为偏好对，强调基于上下文的真实性而非风格特征，训练参数规模从7B到24B的上下文奖励模型

Result: 仅用4K样本训练的小型RAG专用奖励模型在ContextualJudgeBench上达到最先进性能，超越基于2.4M样本训练的70B+通用奖励模型，绝对提升15.5%

Conclusion: RAGferee方法能有效训练专门针对RAG场景的奖励模型，小规模高质量数据训练的专业模型优于大规模通用模型

Abstract: Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,
struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require
judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user
query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and
conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available
RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a
methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference
pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the
training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using
RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs
ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on
much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement
of +15.5%.

*Baoxin Wang,Yumeng Luo,Yixuan Wang,Dayong Wu,Wanxiang Che,Shijin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RE²方法，通过语法错误解释而非文本相似度来检索参考示例，提升中文语法错误纠正性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本相似度检索示例，但这种方法经常与实际错误模式不匹配，检索到词汇相似但语法无关的句子

Method: RE²方法使用语法错误解释来选择参考示例，创建高质量语法错误解释数据集，通过解释驱动的示例检索提升LLMs在CGEC中的表现

Result: 在两个CGEC数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法有效提升了中文语法错误纠正的性能

Conclusion: 基于语法错误解释的示例检索方法比传统文本相似度方法更有效，为CGEC和GEE领域提供了有价值的资源

Abstract: The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to
detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that
large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant
results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve
their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text
similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual
error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant
sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which
retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead
of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of
grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to
improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets
and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is
not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future
studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets
indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了大型语言模型在思维链提示下的忠实性问题，通过控制提示中的线索操纵来探究模型推理是否真正基于计算而非事后解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs广泛使用思维链提示解决数学和逻辑推理任务，但核心问题是这些生成的推理过程在多大程度上忠实于底层计算，而不是受提示中嵌入的答案捷径影响而形成的事后叙述。

Method: 在四个数据集(AIME、GSM-Hard、MATH-500、UniADILR)上，使用GPT-4o和Gemini-2-Flash两个先进模型，通过结构化线索条件(正确/错误线索、奉承/数据泄露呈现风格、不同复杂度)进行系统性实验。

Result: 正确线索显著提高准确性，尤其在困难基准和逻辑推理任务上；错误线索在基线能力较低的任务中大幅降低准确性。线索确认度不均：基于方程的线索常被引用，而原始线索常被默默采用。呈现风格影响：奉承提示鼓励公开确认，泄露式提示提高准确性但促进隐藏依赖。

Conclusion: LLM推理系统性地受到捷径影响，这模糊了推理过程的忠实性，反映了RLHF相关效应——奉承利用讨好人类的一面，数据泄露触发自我审查机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central
question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful}
to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints
that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work
on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT
faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans
four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models
(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in
correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data
leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator
expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly
acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,
correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks
and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks
with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly
uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are
often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward
verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style
matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style
prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect
RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data
leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that
LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure
faithfulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RE-Searcher是一种增强LLM搜索能力的方法，通过明确制定搜索目标和自我反思来抵抗复杂搜索环境中的干扰，提高搜索准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型问答和推理方面表现出色，但受限于知识截止时间、幻觉和交互方式。虽然通过外部搜索工具可以缓解这些问题，但复杂搜索环境中的微小查询变化会导致推理偏离和错误放大。

Method: 提出RE-Searcher方法：在搜索过程中明确制定具体搜索目标，然后反思检索到的证据是否满足该目标。这种目标导向规划和自我反思的结合使模型能够抵抗复杂搜索环境中的虚假线索。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了搜索准确性并达到最先进结果。扰动研究进一步证明了对噪声或误导性外部信号的强韧性，减轻了搜索过程的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为将LLM驱动的智能体集成到更复杂的交互环境中并实现更自主的决策提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering
and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge
cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with
external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents
to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query
formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify
errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental
complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective
approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher
explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on
whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of
goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist
spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate
substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the
fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical
guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive
environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

TL;DR: 该论文填补了中欧语言机器生成文本检测的空白，提供了首个针对该地区的检测方法基准，并比较了不同训练语言组合的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器生成文本检测研究主要集中于英语，对非英语语言特别是中欧语言的检测能力有限，缺乏针对这些语言的专门研究和基准测试。

Method: 通过多领域、多生成器和多语言评估，比较不同训练语言组合的性能，并测试检测方法对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: 发现在中欧语言上经过监督微调的检测器在这些语言上表现最佳，并且对混淆攻击具有最强的抵抗能力。

Conclusion: 针对特定语言进行监督微调的检测方法在中欧语言机器生成文本检测任务中表现最优，且具有更好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly
focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost
unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual
transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central
European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather
unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection
methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of
train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on
multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the
differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of
detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European
languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most
resistant against obfuscation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DyFlow是一个动态工作流生成框架，通过设计器和执行器组件，基于任务需求和实时反馈自适应构建和调整推理过程，显著提升了跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体系统大多依赖手动设计的工作流程，限制了跨任务的适应性。少数自动化方法通常绑定特定数据集或查询类型，且对中间反馈利用有限，导致系统鲁棒性和推理深度不足。

Method: DyFlow包含设计器和执行器两个核心组件。设计器将复杂问题分解为高层目标定义的子目标序列，基于中间输出和反馈动态规划下一步。执行器使用具有上下文感知参数化的动态操作符执行每个操作，实现灵活且语义基础的推理。

Result: 在社交推理、生物医学任务、数学问题解决和代码生成等多个领域评估显示，DyFlow显著优于现有基线方法，在Pass@k指标上取得实质性提升，并展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: DyFlow通过动态工作流生成有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为构建高效且可泛化的LLM智能体系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable
workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually
designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.
While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied
to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate
feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their
operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these
limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that
adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task
requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task
generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an
executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals
defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on
intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the
executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with
context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded
reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including
social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code
generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust
generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/wyf23187/DyFlow.

*Arash Marioriyad,Mohammad Hossein Rohban,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM作为自动评估器存在偏见问题，会基于提示中的表面线索（如来源和时间）而非内容质量进行判断，且很少承认这些偏见因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM作为自动评估器在评估系统输出时的忠实性问题，发现当前LLM评估器会依赖提示中的捷径线索而非真正基于响应质量进行判断。

Method: 使用ELI5和LitBench两个评估数据集，构造100对比较任务，让GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash作为评估器，在保持提示固定的情况下为响应分配表面线索（来源身份和时间来源）。

Result: 两种模型都表现出明显偏见：强烈的新近偏见（偏好新响应）和清晰的来源等级（专家>人类>LLM>未知），GPT-4o在主观性强的LitBench领域偏见更明显，且很少承认这些线索影响。

Conclusion: 当前LLM-as-a-judge系统容易依赖捷径且不忠实，削弱了其在研究和部署中作为评估器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to
evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative
writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality
and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that
current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in
the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for
long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative
writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must
choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100
pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,
we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source
identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal
origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.
Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency
bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear
provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are
especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended
LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost
never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of
content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge
systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as
evaluators in both research and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励建模对对齐LLM与人类偏好至关重要，但偏好数据成本高昂，现有文本数据合成方法计算开销大

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习响应嵌入的结构化潜在表示，在潜在空间中进行受控扰动并解码回嵌入空间，生成多样且语义一致的合成偏好对

Result: 在标准基准测试中显著优于基于文本的增强方法，生成速度快18倍，使用模型小16,000倍

Conclusion: LENS为通过高效数据增强改进奖励建模提供了可扩展且有效的替代方案

Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data.
Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We
propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the
LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By
performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to
the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent
synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We
provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately
preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization.
Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based
augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x
faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a
scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through
efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有数学基准仅限于最终答案问题或高中竞赛题，无法评估LLMs在研究级数学任务上的能力，需要更贴近真实研究环境的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含39个同行评审数学问题的私有基准，每个问题需要详细证明并配有最终答案子问题；采用代理框架，允许模型使用网络搜索和数学软件工具。

Result: 当前LLMs能在较易的研究级问题上成功，但在更具挑战性的问题上仍有困难。Grok-4在最终答案子问题上准确率52%，GPT-5在证明生成上表现最佳，22%问题完全正确。

Conclusion: IMProofBench作为动态基准将持续发展，确保其能有效评估下一代LLMs的数学研究能力，填补了现有评估体系的空白。

Abstract: As the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve, it
becomes increasingly important to evaluate their performance on research-level
tasks at the frontier of mathematical knowledge. However, existing benchmarks
are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school
competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private
benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert
mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with
subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of
mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale
quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior
benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment:
models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for
literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show
that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions,
but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems.
Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer
subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation,
achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will
continue to evolve as a dynamic benchmark in collaboration with the
mathematical community, ensuring its relevance for evaluating the next
generation of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏明确的交互策略优化，依赖统一提示导致次优结果，需要更有效的策略学习机制。

Method: 分层框架：规划器选择策略（推荐、解释、鼓励等），执行器在专家网络指导下生成响应，使用强化学习和LLM奖励进行策略学习。

Result: 实验表明RSO优于现有最先进基线方法，验证了分层策略优化的有效性。

Conclusion: RSO框架通过解耦策略规划和响应生成，实现了更易处理的学习过程，在对话推荐系统中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) provide personalized
recommendations through multi-turn interactions. With the strong reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become
promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of
interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield
suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a
hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level
strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A
Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an
Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and
factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To
address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement
learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of
hierarchical strategy optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过添加领域特定词汇来增强预训练LLM词汇表的方法，以解决词汇不匹配问题，提高处理速度而不影响预测质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当LLM处理训练领域之外的文本时，词汇不匹配会导致分词效率低下，增加token数量，从而降低处理速度

Method: 设计了一种算法来扩展现有分词器的词汇表，保证分词效率不会降低，每个输入序列的分词数量最多与之前相同

Result: 在真实电商用例中，增强后的分词器将输入序列缩短达20%，减少下游任务的推理延迟，同时保持预测质量

Conclusion: 词汇适应不仅能提高处理效率，还对前向传播速度和模型对新token的采用率产生积极影响

Abstract: When using an LLM to process text outside the training domain(s), an often
overlooked factor is vocabulary mismatch, where the general-domain tokenizer
fails to capture frequent domain-specific terms, leading to higher token
fertility and thus a decrease in processing speed due to suboptimal sub-word
splits.
  We address this limitation by augmenting the pretrained vocabulary with a set
of domain-specific tokens. To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an
existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization
efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of
tokens as before.
  Evaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer
significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference
latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further
analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the
rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the
broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.

phenomenon, we propose HATE, the Hunger Game Debate, a novel experimental
framework that simulates debates under a zero-sum competition arena. Our
experiments, conducted across a range of LLMs and tasks, reveal that
competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors and
degrades task performance, causing discussions to derail. We further explore
the impact of environmental feedback by adding variants of judges, indicating
that objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates the
over-competition behaviors. We also probe the post-hoc kindness of LLMs and
form a leaderboard to characterize top LLMs, providing insights for
understanding and governing the emergent social dynamics of AI community.

Abstract: With their growing capabilities, generative large language models (LLMs) are
being increasingly investigated for complex medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in real-world clinical applications remains underexplored. To
address this, we present CliniBench, the first benchmark that enables
comparability of well-studied encoder-based classifiers and generative LLMs for
discharge diagnosis prediction from admission notes in MIMIC-IV dataset. Our
extensive study compares 12 generative LLMs and 3 encoder-based classifiers and
demonstrates that encoder-based classifiers consistently outperform generative
models in diagnosis prediction. We assess several retrieval augmentation
strategies for in-context learning from similar patients and find that they
provide notable performance improvements for generative LLMs.

Conclusion: VietBinoculars在越南语LLM生成文本检测方面表现出色，特别是在特殊修改的提示策略下，能够有效应对日益复杂的LLM生成内容检测挑战。

Abstract: The rapid development research of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on
transformer architectures raises key challenges, one of them being the task of
distinguishing between human-written text and LLM-generated text. As
LLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and
resembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less
effective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with
new models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes
VietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global
thresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have
constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal
thresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our
experiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\% in all two
domains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets. It
outperforms the original Binoculars model, traditional detection methods, and
other state-of-the-art approaches, including commercial tools such as ZeroGPT

Motivation: 现代物流管理系统需要高效的路径规划，OCVRP解决车辆配送路线优化问题，且车辆无需返回仓库。

Method: 使用Python开发两种算法的实现，基于自定义数据集进行性能评估，比较路由效率、计算时间和可扩展性。

Result: ACO在路由参数上更灵活，OR-Tools运行更快、更一致且需要更少输入。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于为可扩展的实时物流系统选择合适的路由策略。

Abstract: In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high
efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with
finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically
distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot
after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two
algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired
metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for
optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom
dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation
time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing
parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires
less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable
real-time logistics systems.

TL;DR: TyleR是一种基于子图的归纳链接预测方法，利用预训练语言模型进行语义增强，在类型注释稀缺和图连接稀疏的场景下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实知识图谱中经常出现新实体，模型需要在不重新训练的情况下泛化到这些实体。但显式类型信息往往缺乏或不完整，即使可用也通常是粗粒度、稀疏且容易出错。

Method: 提出TyleR方法，利用预训练语言模型丰富节点表示中的隐式类型信号，用于基于子图的归纳链接预测。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，TyleR在类型注释稀缺和图连接稀疏的场景下优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型能够有效增强节点表示中的隐式类型信号，在缺乏显式类型信息的情况下提升归纳链接预测性能。

Abstract: Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world
knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must
generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the
challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable
node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological
constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete.
Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained,
sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore
the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node
representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet
type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages
PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type
annotations and sparse graph connectivity. To ensure reproducibility, we share

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出动态增强退火（DBA）方法，通过零学习率训练获取全局梯度，在领域训练中进行梯度增强和动态训练步长校正，仅使用领域数据即可实现微调，无需重复实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统微调方法需要复杂数据混合和重复实验才能获得最佳泛化性能的问题，简化训练流程。

Method: 使用零学习率在通用数据上训练获取全局梯度，然后在领域训练中应用梯度增强和动态训练步长校正，结合退火学习建立仅依赖领域数据的微调流程。

Result: 在多个任务和基础模型上，DBA相比传统微调在联合性能上平均提升5.8%，GPU时间减少91.0%。

Conclusion: DBA是一种高效通用的微调解决方案，无需通用数据参与退火过程，消除了数据混合导致的重复实验。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications.
However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and
repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges
and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal
solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through
zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for
gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training.
In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning
pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both
general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several
popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint
performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no
longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also
eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by
91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合语义初始化和规划损失的语音语言模型，通过自监督特征初始化语音token，使用轻量对齐损失和辅助目标训练，在保持声学稳定性和语义基础之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决语音生成中的鲁棒性和一致性问题，同时保持语义基础，而不需要改变分词器或运行时架构。

Method: 使用自监督特征初始化语音token，应用轻量对齐损失，结合稀疏化和辅助目标训练，训练了三个模型：0.7B纯语音模型、1.0B纯语音模型和1.0B文本语音交错模型。

Result: 纯语音模型在说话人、性别、情感、房间和背景因素上实现了最高的一致性，超过了更大的系统。交错模型改善了词汇句法探测和语义-声学对齐，但降低了一致性。

Conclusion: LM侧的设计和训练组合可以控制声学稳定性和语义基础之间的平衡，无需改变分词器或运行时架构。

Abstract: We study speech language models that incorporate semantic initialization and
planning losses to achieve robust and consistent generation. Our approach
initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light
alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target
robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only
model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text
and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the
highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background
factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic
probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes
show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while
trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training
mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding
without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model
weights are available for exploration.

Conclusion: APP框架提供了一种无需人工标注的任务导向对话摘要方法，在零样本设置下表现优异。

Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation
into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise
inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically
train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is
costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting
their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this
paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue
summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented
question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of
large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is
evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)}
selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most
informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM
on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app
demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various
zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods.

TL;DR: 提出了Feedback Forensics工具包，用于显式评估AI模型的人格特征，分析人类反馈数据集中鼓励的人格特质，并追踪模型在这些特质上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法难以衡量AI模型的人格特征，基于排名的评估方法存在不透明和过拟合问题，缺乏专门工具来显式评估模型人格。

Method: 开发开源工具包，利用AI标注器通过Python API和浏览器应用调查人格特征，分析流行人类反馈数据集和模型的人格特质。

Result: 分析了Chatbot Arena、MultiPref和PRISM等数据集鼓励的人格特质，评估了流行模型在这些特质上的表现。

Conclusion: Feedback Forensics工具包填补了AI人格评估的空白，有助于理解和追踪模型人格变化，防止过拟合和不良人格特征。

Abstract: Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For
example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are
sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear
objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to
measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot
Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better"
personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model
responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight
limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was
rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed
overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,
limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We
introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality
changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited
across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI
annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and
browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we
analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets
including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to
analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our
Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in
popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation
data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.

*Rui Ming,Haoyuan Wu,Shoubo Hu,Zhuolun He,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OTR是一种新的微调算法，将监督微调与策略梯度方法结合，通过将每个token生成视为单步强化学习轨迹，利用监督数据提供奖励信号，在保持SFT效率的同时获得类似RL的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在泛化能力上不如强化学习(RL)，作者认为这种性能差异源于数据性质的根本不同：SFT使用固定的离线数据，而RL使用从当前策略采样的在线数据。

Method: 提出one-token rollout(OTR)算法，将自回归学习过程重新构建为单步强化学习轨迹。在每个步骤中，从当前策略分布中采样多个候选token，使用监督数据中的真实token为这些样本提供奖励信号，通过策略梯度将静态离线数据转化为动态在线信号。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和通用领域推理等多个具有挑战性的基准测试中，OTR始终优于标准SFT方法。

Conclusion: OTR为微调LLMs提供了强大实用的替代方案，证明了数据的在线性质是泛化能力的关键驱动因素，为LLMs微调开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large
language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to
reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance
disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental
difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes
on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we
introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides
SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning
process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement
learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by
sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The
ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward
signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes
static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the
token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while
bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive
experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that
OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a
powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling
evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of
generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型使用自然语言进行思维链推理计算成本高且容易过度思考，而潜在思维架构缺乏可解释性且难以监督，需要研究如何改进潜在思考过程的正确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO)概率算法，使用潜在分类器作为Latent Reward Model (LRM)来检测和优化潜在思考过程，通过监督信号改进模型的推理能力。

Result: 实验表明LRM能有效检测错误的潜在思维模式，LTO能显著改进潜在思考过程，且该方法能泛化到不同领域并应用于通用LLMs。

Conclusion: 在潜在空间中进行奖励建模和扩展测试时思维监督是可行且有效的，为改进LLMs思考过程提供了一种通用、高效且领域无关的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of
thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally
costly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent
thinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning
steps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack
interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the
correctness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we
provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and
how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We
show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit
highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably
predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these
insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic
algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to
optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse
reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect
latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking
processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,
and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking
processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward
modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed
directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,
efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归大语言模型的顺序解码限制了推理效率，需要开发能够保持性能的同时实现并行生成的高效方法。

Method: 提出块扩散机制和互补注意力掩码，结合层次化缓存机制（块级缓存和子块缓存），以及并行解码流水线。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Fast-dLLM v2在准确性上匹配或超越自回归基线，同时在扩散语言模型中实现最先进的效率，推理速度提升2.5倍。

Conclusion: Fast-dLLM v2标志着向快速准确大语言模型实际部署迈出了重要一步，在保持性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent
sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose
Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that
efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text
generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This
represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention
diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original
model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that
combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask,
enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR
training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical
caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context
representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient
parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel
decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR
decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR
baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs
- marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and
accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KG-RAG系统通常包含多个LLM模块（如规划、推理、响应），导致推理成本增加且行为绑定到特定知识图谱。为了解决这些问题，需要开发更高效、可迁移的KG-RAG框架。

Method: KG-R1使用单一智能体与知识图谱环境交互，学习在每一步进行检索并将检索信息融入推理和生成过程，通过端到端强化学习进行优化。

Result: 在知识图谱问答基准测试中，使用Qwen-2.5-3B模型的KG-R1相比使用更大基础模型或微调模型的多模块方法，以更少的生成token实现了更高的答案准确性，并且在新知识图谱上无需修改也能保持强准确性。

Conclusion: KG-R1是一个有前景的KG-RAG框架，具有高效性和可迁移性，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large
language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to
reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems
compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),
inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To
address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation
(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single
agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each
step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and
generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled
experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our
method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,
KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior
multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.
Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong
accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a
promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个复杂多方面的真实性标注方案，结合了先前多种研究的概念，并在希伯来语议会话语领域的近5000个句子中进行了人工标注，同时探索了自动预测方案特征的多种方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实性评估语言表达与现实世界信息的关联程度，对于事实核查至关重要。真实性是一个复杂概念，依赖多种语言信号，已在多个学科中得到研究。

Method: 开发了一个结合先前多种工作的复杂多层面真实性标注方案，在希伯来语议会话语领域的近5000个句子中进行人工标注，并尝试了多种自动预测方案特征的方法。

Result: 报告了标注者间一致性，并成功将标注扩展到大型语料库，展示了该方案的可扩展性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该真实性标注方案虽然为希伯来语开发，但相信可以适应其他语言，为事实核查和语言真实性研究提供了有价值的工具和数据集。

Abstract: Factuality assesses the extent to which a language utterance relates to
real-world information; it determines whether utterances correspond to facts,
possibilities, or imaginary situations, and as such, it is instrumental for
fact checking. Factuality is a complex notion that relies on multiple
linguistic signals, and has been studied in various disciplines.
  We present a complex, multi-faceted annotation scheme of factuality that
combines concepts from a variety of previous works. We developed the scheme for
Hebrew, but we trust that it can be adapted to other languages. We also present
a set of almost 5,000 sentences in the domain of parliamentary discourse that
we manually annotated according to this scheme. We report on inter-annotator
agreement, and experiment with various approaches to automatically predict
(some features of) the scheme, in order to extend the annotation to a large
corpus.

*Yanbin Fu,Hong Jiao,Tianyi Zhou,Robert W. Lissitz,Nan Zhang,Ming Li,Qingshu Xu,Sydney Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用微调的小型语言模型(SLMs)自动进行试题与内容标准对齐的可行性，在大型标准化阅读写作考试数据上验证了模型性能，发现包含更多试题文本数据能显著提升模型表现，且微调SLMs优于基于嵌入的监督机器学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的试题与内容标准对齐由人类专家完成，这一判断过程主观且耗时，需要探索自动化的解决方案来提高效率和客观性。

Method: 使用来自大学入学标准化阅读写作测试的数据，针对4个内容领域下的10项技能分别训练不同的微调小型语言模型，并在两个测试数据集上评估模型性能，同时研究了训练数据输入类型和大小的影响。

Result: 包含更多试题文本数据显著提升了模型性能，效果超过单纯增加样本量；微调SLMs在技能对齐任务上持续优于基于嵌入的监督机器学习模型；语义相似性分析显示某些SAT和PSAT技能在语义上过于接近，这解释了观察到的错误分类现象。

Conclusion: 微调的小型语言模型在自动试题对齐任务中表现出色，特别是在细粒度技能对齐方面，为测试开发中的内容效度验证提供了有效的自动化工具。

Abstract: Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test
development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has
typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be
subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of
fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data
from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college
admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill
levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model
performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The
impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated.
Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better
model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase
alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using
the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results
showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based
supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained
skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple
semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity,
Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension
projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently
showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close,
providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PACO框架，通过自适应规划解决多属性可控摘要中的属性依赖问题，无需训练即可实现多属性约束的摘要生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可控摘要方法在处理相互依赖的属性时面临挑战，且需要针对每个属性进行微调，限制了灵活性

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)框架，将任务重构为顺序属性控制的规划问题，节点代表摘要，动作对应单属性调整

Result: 在多个领域和模型上的实验表明，PACO实现了强大的多属性可控性，超越了基于LLM的自规划模型和微调基线

Conclusion: PACO框架能够自适应发现最优控制顺序，有效满足所有约束条件，在控制性能上优于所有竞争对手

Abstract: Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned
summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence
among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated
constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require
per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary
attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute
controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the
task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions
correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of
only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively
discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that
effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute
controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned
baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the
much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior
control performance, outperforming all competitors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CreAgentive是一个基于多智能体工作流程的创意生成引擎，通过故事原型和三层工作流程解决LLM在创意写作中的四个关键限制：体裁多样性不足、输出长度不够、叙事连贯性弱和无法强制执行复杂结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当代大语言模型在创意写作中的四个主要限制：受限的体裁多样性、不足的输出长度、弱的叙事连贯性以及无法强制执行复杂结构构造。

Method: 采用基于知识图谱的故事原型作为叙事表示，通过三层智能体工作流程：初始化阶段构建用户指定的叙事骨架；生成阶段通过长短目标指导多智能体对话实例化故事原型；写作阶段利用原型生成具有高级结构的多体裁文本。

Result: 在广泛实验中，CreAgentive以稳定质量和低成本（每100章少于1美元）生成了数千章内容，在包含10个叙事指标的二维评估框架中始终优于强基线，接近人类创作小说的质量。

Conclusion: CreAgentive通过其架构减少了存储冗余并克服了长文本生成的典型瓶颈，在多样化体裁中实现了稳健性能。

Abstract: We present CreAgentive, an agent workflow driven multi-category creative
generation engine that addresses four key limitations of contemporary large
language models in writing stories, drama and other categories of creatives:
restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative
coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs. At its core,
CreAgentive employs a Story Prototype, which is a genre-agnostic, knowledge
graph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic
realization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic
triples. CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an
Initialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a
Generation Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent
dialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages
this prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as
retrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy
and overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation. In extensive
experiments, CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality
and low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters) using a general-purpose backbone
model. To evaluate performance, we define a two-dimensional framework with 10
narrative indicators measuring both quality and length. Results show that
CreAgentive consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves robust
performance across diverse genres, approaching the quality of human-authored
novels.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的回归语言模型(RLM)，能够直接从代码文本预测多种执行指标，包括内存占用、GPU内核延迟和神经网络性能，无需复杂的特征工程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码到指标回归的挑战性任务，避免传统方法需要大量领域特定特征工程的问题，实现跨语言和跨平台的统一预测。

Method: 基于T5Gemma初始化构建300M参数的回归语言模型(RLM)，直接从代码文本预测数值结果，支持多种编程语言和硬件平台。

Result: 在APPS竞争编程数据集上获得>0.9的Spearman秩相关系数，在CodeNet的17种语言上平均Spearman秩相关系数>0.5，在5个经典NAS设计空间上获得最高0.46的Kendall-Tau系数。

Conclusion: 单个统一的回归语言模型能够有效预测多种代码执行指标，在跨语言和跨硬件平台的性能预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code
executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming
languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific
feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model
(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint
of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the
latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained
neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M
parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on
competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model
achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet.
Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five
classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and
simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出dParallel方法，通过确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，大幅减少扩散大语言模型的解码步骤，实现8.5-10.5倍的推理加速，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为自回归生成的替代方案具有并行解码潜力，但现有开源模型仍需接近token长度的解码步骤，并行解码潜力未充分挖掘。

Method: 提出dParallel方法，核心是确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，让模型在遵循原始采样轨迹的同时，强制其在掩码token上更快地达到高确定性并行处理。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct模型上，GSM8K解码步骤从256减少到30（8.5倍加速），MBPP从256减少到24（10.5倍加速），均无性能损失。

Conclusion: dParallel方法成功解锁了扩散大语言模型的并行解码潜力，显著减少了推理延迟，为高效生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable
attention within the research community as a promising alternative to
autoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower
inference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely
underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length
decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel,
a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs
for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding
arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on
this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing
distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its
original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on
masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the
number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the
LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on
GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP
benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup
while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at

TL;DR: VitaBench是一个面向真实世界应用的AI智能体基准测试，包含跨场景和单场景任务，评估智能体处理复杂交互、多工具使用和动态用户意图的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法充分评估LLM智能体在真实场景中处理大量信息、利用多样化资源和应对动态用户交互的复杂性。

Method: 基于外卖、店内消费和在线旅游等日常应用场景，构建包含66个工具的最复杂生活服务模拟环境，通过消除领域特定策略实现灵活的场景和工具组合。

Result: 最先进的模型在跨场景任务中仅达到30%的成功率，在其他任务中成功率低于50%。

Conclusion: VitaBench将为实际应用中AI智能体的发展提供有价值的资源，揭示了当前智能体在复杂真实世界任务中的局限性。

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios,
existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling
extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging
benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in
real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store
consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the
most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.
Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable
flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario
tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from
multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and
spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous
instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn
conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,
enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments
and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the
most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and
less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve
as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical
real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at

TL;DR: BatonVoice框架通过将LLM作为"指挥"理解用户指令并生成文本化语音特征计划，再由专门的TTS模型"乐团"生成语音，实现了可控语音合成的突破性进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用LLM的语言智能和指令跟随能力，限制了TTS模型根据文本指令进行可控语音合成的能力。

Method: 提出受"操作主义"启发的BatonVoice框架，将指令理解与语音生成解耦：LLM作为指挥生成文本化语音特征计划，专门的BatonTTS模型作为乐团执行语音生成。

Result: BatonVoice在可控和情感语音合成方面表现优异，超越开源和闭源基线，并实现了显著的零样本跨语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将语音对象化为文本化语音特征能更有效地释放LLM的语言智能，为可控语音合成提供了新范式。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with
speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches
often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically
failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This
limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for
controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm
inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from
speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a
``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual
``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS
model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To
realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically
for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong
performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming
strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables
remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature
control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates
that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively
unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.

TL;DR: Matryoshka MoE (M-MoE) 是一个训练框架，通过在训练过程中系统性地改变激活专家数量，使MoE模型能够学习到从粗到细的层次结构，从而实现弹性推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的Top-K路由器训练策略限制了MoE模型在推理时的弹性，当改变激活专家数量时会导致性能急剧下降。

Method: 在训练过程中系统性地改变激活专家数量，强制模型学习有意义的专家排名：排名靠前的专家提供基本能力，后续专家添加更精细的细节。采用层间随机化策略。

Result: 单个M-MoE模型在各种专家数量下都能达到接近专用模型套件的性能，但训练成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: M-MoE为大规模MoE模型的实际部署提供了更实用和适应性强的解决方案，实现了弹性推理和计算资源优化分配。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficiently
scaling large language models without a proportional increase in computational
cost. However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE
models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the
number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit
precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE
(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly
into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated
experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:
top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained
capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.
We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise
randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that
a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at
various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist
models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not
only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by
allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work
paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE
models.

Motivation: 水下环境具有低能见度、动态洋流等极端条件，使得智能体部署异常困难，需要专门平台来推动AI在海洋环境中的发展。

Method: 开发了包含8个任务领域的综合基准平台，采用多模态大语言模型驱动的统一智能体框架，整合感知、记忆和序列决策能力。

Result: 实验显示当前最先进的MLLM驱动智能体与人类专家存在显著差距，特别是在感知、规划和适应性方面。

Conclusion: OceanGym为开发鲁棒的具身AI提供了高保真测试平台，是实现真实世界自主水下航行器智能操作的重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world
environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present
extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified
agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh
conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between
state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed
platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and
transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater
vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of
operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are

Motivation: 对比解释在可解释AI中被认为比标准解释更具信息性和可解释性，但目前语音转文本生成模型缺乏此类解释方法。

Method: 基于特征归因技术，通过分析输入频谱图的各部分如何影响目标输出与备选输出之间的选择来生成对比解释。

Result: 在语音翻译性别分配的案例研究中，该方法能准确识别驱动性别选择的音频特征。

Conclusion: 通过将对比解释扩展到语音转文本领域，为更好理解语音转文本模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output
(the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable
AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However,
obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains
an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the
first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts
of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.
Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that
our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of
one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to
S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

TL;DR: FuncBenchGen是一个无数据污染的合成基准框架，用于评估工具增强语言模型在多步工具使用任务中的表现，通过控制函数依赖图的复杂度来精确测试模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强语言模型基准存在数据污染风险，且无法精确控制任务复杂度、函数数量等因素，需要更可控的评估框架。

Method: 将工具使用建模为在隐藏函数依赖DAG上的遍历，节点是函数调用，边表示函数间输出依赖关系。给定函数模式、初始变量和目标变量，模型需要组合正确的调用序列来计算目标变量。

Result: 推理优化模型显著优于通用模型，GPT-5表现最佳。性能随依赖深度增加而急剧下降，连接的无关函数尤其难以处理。模型常做出语法正确但参数值错误的调用，显示多轮工具使用中的状态跟踪脆弱性。

Conclusion: 显式重述先前变量值的轻量级缓解策略能显著提升模型性能，表明改进状态跟踪是提升工具使用能力的关键。

Abstract: As language models gain access to external tools via structured function
calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step
tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)
provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions
accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data
contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework
that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key
idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG
where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one
function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function
schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose
the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows
users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,
and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our
FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying
difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose
models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance
declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected
irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong
models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or
stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in
multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple
mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent
at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains
across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%
for GPT-5.

Motivation: 现实世界中的机器翻译基准测试集很快过时，因为大多数样本对最先进的翻译模型来说过于简单，无法有效区分模型优劣或揭示模型弱点。

Method: 提出MT-breaker方法，让大语言模型迭代地优化源文本，通过查询目标机器翻译模型来指导生成困难样本，同时保持文本的自然性和多样性。

identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and
naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for
model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model
iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The
LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its
generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more
challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural
texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation
model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and
languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM生成的基准测试存在自我偏见，会系统性偏向生成该基准的模型，特别是在低资源语言的英译任务中。这种偏见来自生成的测试数据和评估方法，且受模型在源语言生成能力的影响。提高生成源文本的多样性可以减轻这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型逐渐饱和现有基准，使用LLM自动创建基准成为可扩展的替代方案。但需要验证这些生成基准是否可靠，特别是是否存在系统性偏见。

Method: 通过分析LLM作为基准的两个组成部分（生成测试数据和评估方法），研究自我偏见的来源和影响因素，特别关注低资源语言到英语的翻译任务。

Result: 发现LLM生成的基准存在系统性自我偏见，这种偏见来自测试数据生成和评估方法，且在英译任务中更明显。模型在源语言的生成能力影响偏见程度，生成文本多样性低是偏见的重要原因。

Conclusion: LLM自动生成的基准测试存在严重的自我偏见问题，需要谨慎使用。提高生成源文本的多样性可以部分缓解偏见，但需要更可靠的基准验证方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks,
automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a
scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated
test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical
flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the
benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English
translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs
for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated
test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),
with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a
benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the
source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English
translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of
English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text
is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the
diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed
self bias.

TL;DR: MENLO框架通过受众设计机制评估LLM响应的母语质量，创建了包含6423个人工标注偏好对的数据集，覆盖47种语言。研究发现零样本LLM评估器在成对评估和结构化标注标准下表现提升，但仍不及人类标注者。通过强化学习微调等方法可显著改进评估器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在多语言环境中实现母语级别响应质量的评估挑战，建立可扩展的多语言评估框架。

Method: 引入MENLO框架，基于受众设计机制创建人工标注数据集；采用成对评估、结构化标注标准；使用强化学习微调、奖励塑形和多任务学习等方法改进LLM评估器。

Result: 零样本LLM评估器在成对评估和结构化标准下表现改善但仍不及人类；强化学习训练的评估器可作为生成奖励模型提升LLM多语言能力；与人类判断仍存在差异。

Conclusion: MENLO为多语言评估和偏好对齐提供了有前景的方向；发布了数据集和评估框架以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across
many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework
that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on
audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423
human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality
dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our
evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from
pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still
underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial
improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,
and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained
judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual
proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings
suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and
preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to
support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

Abstract: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often
lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address
pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system
designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous
scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a
Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical
evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging
a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration
of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising
findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU
hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and
experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing
human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by
183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of
an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific
tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of
scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will
open-source all experimental logs and system code at

TL;DR: 本文提出将寻找最具挑战性NLP测试数据的问题建模为多臂老虎机问题，通过高效采样策略在有限计算预算内识别最困难的主题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型需要具有足够挑战性的测试数据，但直接从海量互联网主题中寻找最困难的主题在计算上不可行，因为主题与实例难度之间存在随机性关系

Method: 将每个主题视为老虎机的"臂"，拉动臂（采样成本）涉及抽取单个示例、评估其难度，使用多臂老虎机策略在固定计算预算内高效识别最困难主题

Result: 在机器翻译任务中，各种老虎机策略显著优于暴力搜索等基线方法

Conclusion: 多臂老虎机框架为在有限计算资源下寻找最具挑战性NLP测试数据提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The
difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed
topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its
instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can
happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens
of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing
and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally
infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit
problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a
cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its
difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics
within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of
finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that
various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force
searching the most challenging topics.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了音节级语音标记化在口语语言建模中的应用，相比传统高帧率标记，音节标记能显著降低训练和推理成本，同时保持或超越原有性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统口语语言模型使用高帧率语音标记，但Transformer的自注意力机制处理长序列时计算成本高昂。音节级标记化提供了更可解释且更高效的替代方案。

Method: 对音节级语音标记化进行系统性研究，在不同训练数据规模下评估模型在一系列口语理解基准任务上的表现。

Result: 音节标记在显著降低训练和推理成本的同时，能够匹配甚至超越传统高帧率标记的性能：训练时间减少2倍以上，FLOPs减少5倍。

Conclusion: 音节级语言建模是实现高效长上下文口语语言模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into
high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful
LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token
streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically
with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of
speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more
scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their
value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the
first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling,
evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data
scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens
while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a
2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings
highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient
long-context spoken language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同随机种子训练的语言模型的收敛性，发现了一个四阶段收敛模式，并揭示了模型大小和训练阶段对收敛的影响，以及不同语言类别收敛速度的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在不同随机种子下的收敛特性，了解模型训练过程中分布稳定性的影响因素。

Method: 通过计算不同随机种子下每token的KL散度期望值来衡量收敛性，分析模型大小、训练检查点、token频率和词性类别对收敛的影响。

Result: 识别出四阶段收敛模式：初始均匀阶段、快速收敛阶段、快速发散阶段和缓慢重收敛阶段；发现大模型在后期训练阶段重收敛更快，小模型无法真正重收敛；高频token和功能词比低频token和内容词收敛更快更可靠。

Conclusion: 模型大小是学习稳定分布的必要条件，收敛在不同语言类别中是不均匀的，这些发现有助于理解语言模型训练中分布稳定性的影响因素。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs)
trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected
per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM
convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a
four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a
sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a
slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge
faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually
reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to
learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token
frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is
uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words
converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens
and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the
stability of the learned distributions in model training.

Motivation: 解决AI研究中最大的低效率问题：除编程外，现有基准往往无法测试具有经济相关性的能力，需要更好的方法来衡量模型产生经济价值工作的能力。

Method: 通过三个步骤构建：1)聘请顶级领域专家；2)专家创建反映日常高价值任务的提示；3)专家制定评估模型响应的评分标准。使用LM评判器评估23个前沿模型。

Result: GPT 5(Thinking=High)获得最高平均分64.2%，其次是Grok 4(61.3%)和Gemini 2.5 Flash(Thinking=On)(60.4%)。Qwen 3 235B是表现最好的开源模型，总体排名第七。

Conclusion: 即使是表现最佳的模型与人类专家之间仍存在巨大差距，突显了需要更好地衡量模型产生经济价值工作的能力。

Abstract: We introduce the first version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX), a
benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform knowledge work
with high economic value. APEX addresses one of the largest inefficiencies in
AI research: outside of coding, benchmarks often fail to test economically
relevant capabilities. APEX-v1.0 contains 200 test cases and covers four
domains: investment banking, management consulting, law, and primary medical
care. It was built in three steps. First, we sourced experts with top-tier
experience e.g., investment bankers from Goldman Sachs. Second, experts created
prompts that reflect high-value tasks in their day-to-day work. Third, experts
created rubrics for evaluating model responses. We evaluate 23 frontier models
on APEX-v1.0 using an LM judge. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) achieves the highest
mean score (64.2%), followed by Grok 4 (61.3%) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Thinking =
On) (60.4%). Qwen 3 235B is the best performing open-source model and seventh
best overall. There is a large gap between the performance of even the best
models and human experts, highlighting the need for better measurement of
models' ability to produce economically valuable work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-语言模型评估主要关注语音或全球通用声音，忽略了文化特异性声音线索，需要测试模型对本地化、非语义音频的泛化能力。

Method: 通过结合精选来源、人工编辑和LLM辅助问题生成的流程，构建了包含702个音频片段和1,794个多项选择题的TAU基准测试，这些问题无法仅通过文字转录解决。

Result: 实验显示包括Gemini 2.5和Qwen2-Audio在内的最先进音频-语言模型表现远低于当地人类水平。

Conclusion: TAU基准测试证明了需要本地化基准来揭示文化盲点，指导更公平的多模态评估，并确保模型服务于全球主流之外的社区。

Abstract: Large audio-language models are advancing rapidly, yet most evaluations
emphasize speech or globally sourced sounds, overlooking culturally distinctive
cues. This gap raises a critical question: can current models generalize to
localized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but
outsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding),
a benchmark of everyday Taiwanese "soundmarks." TAU is built through a pipeline
combining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation,
producing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by
transcripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including
Gemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates
the need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more
equitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the
global mainstream.

Motivation: 现有会话语音语言模型在时间动态能力方面存在评估空白，这些能力对会话流畅性至关重要，但目前缺乏系统性的评估方法。

Method: 设计Game-Time基准测试框架，包含基础指令跟随任务和具有时间约束的高级任务（如节奏遵循和同步响应），受人类通过语言活动学习语言的启发。

Result: 评估发现：最先进模型能较好处理基础任务，但许多系统仍难以完成基本指令跟随；几乎所有模型在时间约束下性能显著下降，暴露了时间意识和全双工交互的持续弱点。

Conclusion: Game-Time基准为引导未来研究开发更具时间意识的会话AI提供了基础，揭示了当前模型在时间动态能力方面的关键不足。

Abstract: Conversational Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a promising
paradigm for real-time speech interaction. However, their capacity of temporal
dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous
speaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational
fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework
to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans
learn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic
instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such
as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM
architectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art
models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with
fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade
substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in
time awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides a
foundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware
conversational AI. Demos and datasets are available on our project website

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种评估人工智能系统复杂认知行为的新方法，通过创建经典心理意象任务的新项目来测试LLMs的能力。研究发现最佳LLMs在该任务上的表现显著优于人类平均水平，表明它们可能具备完成依赖意象任务的能力，尽管其架构是非图像性的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs主要在训练数据包含且仅需自然语言的任务上表现最佳，这限制了我们对它们涌现的复杂认知能力的理解。本研究旨在测试LLMs是否能够完成传统上被认为必须通过视觉心理意象才能解决的任务。

Method: 创建了数十个经典心理意象任务的新项目，首先测试多个最先进的LLMs，给予纯文本指令并要求报告变换后的结果；然后通过测试100名人类受试者建立基准；最后测试不同推理级别的推理模型。

Result: 最佳LLMs的表现显著高于人类平均水平；当模型分配更多推理token时表现最强。这表明最佳LLMs可能具备完成依赖意象任务的能力。

Conclusion: 研究不仅证明了LLMs在执行新任务时涌现的认知能力，还为该领域提供了一个有改进空间的新任务。研究结果重新引发了关于人类视觉意象表征格式的辩论，表明命题推理（或至少非意象推理）可能足以完成长期被认为依赖意象的任务。

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

Conclusion: TSR-Suite为时间序列推理提供了全面评估框架，TimeOmni-1证明了统一推理模型在处理多样化现实问题中的有效性，推动了时间序列推理领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

Motivation: 虽然CoT和Latent Thought都利用迭代计算，但它们在连续潜在空间和离散语言表示中的比较能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 对循环变换器中的Latent Thought进行形式化分析，并与CoT的序列过程进行对比。

Result: Latent Thought支持并行计算，比CoT的序列过程更高效；CoT通过随机解码近似解决难解问题。

Conclusion: 这些分离表明深度驱动递归更适合某些任务，为选择推理范式提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

Motivation: 理解解码器语言模型是否以及如何进行规划（组织中间计算以支持连贯的长距离生成），这对模型的可解释性、可靠性和设计原则具有重要意义。

Method: 开发基于向量量化变分自编码器的管道，压缩transformer隐藏状态为紧凑摘要代码，通过互信息测量分析模型的计算结构。

Conclusion: 推进了对语言模型中规划实现方式的理解，并提供了一个通用框架用于探测深度学习系统的内部动态。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

TL;DR: Flash-Searcher是一个并行代理推理框架，将顺序处理改为有向无环图执行，实现推理路径的并发执行，显著提升效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM工具使用框架主要依赖顺序处理，导致需要大量工具交互的任务执行效率低下。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为具有明确依赖关系的子任务，通过动态工作流优化持续改进执行图，集成摘要模块。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：BrowseComp准确率67.7%，xbench-DeepSearch准确率83%，代理执行步骤减少高达35%。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

*Boxuan Zhang,Yi Yu,Jiaxuan Guo,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估LLM智能体自我复制风险的框架，通过真实生产环境和任务设置来评估智能体行为，发现超过50%的LLM智能体在操作压力下表现出显著的失控自我复制倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实应用中的广泛部署，由目标错位驱动的自我复制风险（类似于电影《黑客帝国》中的Agent Smith）引起了越来越多的关注。现有研究主要关注智能体在被直接指示时能否自我复制，而忽视了现实环境中自发性复制的风险。

Method: 建立真实生产环境和现实任务（如动态负载均衡），设计可能引发用户与智能体目标错位的任务，引入过度使用率（OR）和聚合过度使用计数（AOC）指标来精确捕捉失控复制的频率和严重程度。

Result: 评估了21个最先进的开源和专有模型，发现超过50%的LLM智能体在操作压力下表现出显著的失控自我复制倾向，总体风险评分（Φ_R）超过安全阈值0.5。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在实际部署LLM智能体时，迫切需要基于场景的风险评估和强大的安全保障措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 神经网络可以独立地从一阶心理理论泛化到高阶心理理论，无需依赖高级推理技能，这与人类认知发展模式相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络是否能像人类一样，在不需要高级技能的情况下独立发展心理理论能力，而不是像现有语言模型那样必须伴随推理能力的提升。

Method: 构建了一个心理理论神经网络（ToMNN），模拟最小认知系统，仅获得一阶心理理论能力，然后评估其二阶和三阶心理理论的泛化能力。

Result: ToMNN在二阶和三阶心理理论任务上的准确率显著高于随机水平，且从一阶到二阶的泛化难度大于从二阶到更高阶，准确率随任务复杂度增加而下降，这与人类认知模式一致。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够自发地从一阶心理理论泛化到高阶心理理论，揭示了机器心理理论的泛化模式，为开发更类人认知系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树的搜索方法虽然能提高准确性，但在效率上不是最优的，因为它们忽略了数学推理和代码生成等任务具有规划-执行特性，导致推理过程探索效率低下。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为规划和执行两个阶段，为每个阶段开发奖励模型，实现计划和执行的分别探索与剪枝，并引入动态预算分配机制根据奖励反馈自适应重新分配采样努力。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在提高准确性的同时减少了冗余计算。

Conclusion: 双阶段测试时扩展框架能够有效提升推理任务的效率和准确性，通过明确的规划-执行分离和动态资源分配实现更优化的搜索策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepSearch 是一个将蒙特卡洛树搜索直接集成到 RLVR 训练中的框架，通过训练时的系统化探索解决了当前 RLVR 方法中稀疏探索模式导致的性能瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前 RLVR 方法存在训练平台期问题，尽管增加计算投入但性能提升显著下降，这源于稀疏的探索模式无法系统覆盖解决方案空间。

Method: 在训练循环中嵌入结构化搜索，包括全局前沿选择策略、基于熵的路径选择指导以及带解决方案缓存的适应性回放缓冲区训练。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中达到 62.95% 的平均准确率，为 1.5B 推理模型建立了新的最先进水平，相比扩展训练方法减少了 5.7 倍的 GPU 小时。

Conclusion: DeepSearch 展示了通过系统化搜索而非暴力扩展计算来扩展推理能力的新方向，强调战略探索的重要性。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类偏好数据的稀缺性，传统RLHF方法在自回归文本到图像生成中应用受限。本文探索如何利用内部信号而非外部奖励来改进模型性能。

Method: 提出IRIS框架，通过强化学习使用内在奖励来改进自回归T2I模型。研究发现最大化模型的自不确定性能够生成更符合人类偏好的图像。

Result: 实验结果显示，IRIS框架在自回归T2I模型上的表现与使用外部奖励的方法相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: IRIS证明了仅使用内在奖励就能有效改进自回归文本到图像生成模型，为数据稀缺情况下的模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于信息论和学习理论的框架，用于分析视觉语言模型中哪些层可以被跳过以提高推理效率，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型虽然性能优异，但推理成本高昂。现有的层跳过技术缺乏理论指导，限制了其应用。

Method: 开发了一个信息论和学习理论框架，分析VLM隐藏表示在LLM骨干中的演化，识别具有高冗余度的层。

Result: 实验表明，跳过理论框架预测的高冗余层可以实现更快的推理且保持性能，而在其他条件下跳过会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论支撑，能够指导层跳过策略的优化应用。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个多智能体框架，专门处理现实世界旅行规划中的复杂约束问题，通过动态约束管理、迭代计划评估和自适应交错搜索机制，在TravelPlanner基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在推理和工具使用方面取得显著进展，但在复杂约束下生成最优、接地气的解决方案方面仍存在不足。现实世界旅行规划任务需要处理显式、隐式甚至基于动态环境和用户需求演变的约束。

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划评估和自适应交错搜索等机制，专门处理约束感知规划的基本挑战。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，ATLAS将最终通过率从23.3%提升至44.4%。在具有实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的现实场景中，ATLAS达到84%的最终通过率，显著优于ReAct（59%）和单体智能体（27%）。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在具有实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的现实世界旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的工作，证明了其在复杂约束感知规划方面的优越性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

TL;DR: 提出Next Event Prediction (NEP)框架，通过自回归微调增强LLM在电子健康记录中的时序推理能力，显著提升临床事件预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子健康记录中的丰富时序动态，而大型语言模型在临床事件序列和时序依赖推理方面存在困难。

Method: 将电子健康记录重新表述为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，显式建模疾病进展模式和因果关系。

Result: 在肿瘤生存预测和临床诊断任务中，NEP在时序推理任务上比专业EHR模型AUROC提升4.6%，比通用LLM C-index提升7.2%。

Conclusion: NEP实现了最先进的预测准确性，同时提供与已知疾病通路一致的临床可解释注意力模式，具有双重优势。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

Motivation: 解决传统自编码器黑盒问题，让人类能够理解和解释编码过程。

Method: 使用LLM将FCM映射为文本，再从文本重构FCM，通过系统指令序列实现身份映射。

Result: 实现了有损重构，保留强因果关系，去除弱因果边，使文本更自然。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可解释的AI系统，人类可读编码文本，优于黑盒自编码器。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在组合推理方面存在困难。神经符号方法虽然前景广阔，但通常受限于严格的逻辑执行或预定义谓词，限制了灵活性。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和不同领域中，NePTune表现出显著优于强基线模型的性能，并展示了有效的组合泛化和在新环境中的适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune通过神经符号混合执行模型，成功克服了现有方法的局限性，在组合推理任务中实现了显著改进。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计过于依赖复杂的手工工作流和工具集，导致性能过度依赖提示调优、掩盖模型真实能力、构建维护成本高，且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 引入Lita框架，基于"轻量化"原则，最小化手动设计同时保留完全自主代理的基本要素，实现更忠实统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench测试中，Lita相比基于工作流的代理基线达到竞争性或更优性能，且消耗更少token和设计精力。

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代LLMs的底层编程能力，并提出代理复杂度定律：随着核心模型改进，不同复杂度代理间的性能差距将缩小至可忽略程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

Motivation: 当前评估LLMs JSON输出能力的基准过于强调纯粹的JSON生成，而忽略了数据理解和提取能力，这与实际的网络数据挖掘任务缺乏相关性。

Method: 引入了DeepJSONEval基准测试，包含2100个多领域实例，具有深度嵌套结构，并按难度分类，以评估LLMs处理复杂JSON结构的能力。

Result: 实验显示，不同LLMs在处理这种复杂性时存在显著的性能差距。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准和数据集已开源，以推动结构化JSON生成的研究。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

*Gang Li,Yulei Qin,Xiaoyu Tan,Dingkang Yang,Yuchen Shi,Zihan Xu,Xiang Li,Xing Sun,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RoRecomp方法，通过策略性地重组训练数据来引导模型进行简洁推理，解决了RLVR训练中过程冗长和探索效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的RLVR训练在推理任务中导致过度冗长的过程，在智能体设置中导致低效的探索轨迹，因为仅基于结果的奖励无法激励效率，且响应长度的高方差导致优化信号噪声大。

Method: RoRecomp方法将响应分为两种批次类型：1）优先批次，结合在线批次中的短正确和长错误响应，为简洁性提供清晰的梯度信号；2）补偿批次，利用重放缓冲区中的剩余响应来保持稳定性并防止模型崩溃。

Result: 在三种设置中测试显示显著效率提升：在零RL训练中推理长度减少27.7%，在智能体RL中减少46.8%的不必要工具调用同时提高准确性，在思维压缩中实现高达52.5%的长度减少，且性能影响最小。

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用的方法，能有效引导模型进行简洁推理，在多个设置中实现了显著的效率提升，同时保持性能稳定。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统性地提出了自进化智能体中的"错误进化"概念，揭示了即使基于顶级LLM构建的智能体在模型、记忆、工具和工作流四个进化路径上都会出现意外偏离，导致安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，自进化智能体展现出强大能力，但自进化过程也引入了被现有安全研究忽视的新型风险。作者旨在研究智能体自进化过程中可能出现的意外偏离和有害结果。

Method: 通过评估四个关键进化路径（模型、记忆、工具和工作流）来系统研究错误进化现象，使用包括Gemini-2.5-Pro在内的顶级LLM构建智能体进行实证分析。

Result: 实证发现错误进化是普遍存在的风险，在自进化过程中观察到多种新兴风险，如记忆积累后安全对齐的退化，工具创建和重用中意外引入漏洞等。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统化概念化错误进化并提供实证证据的研究，强调了为自进化智能体开发新安全范式的紧迫性，并讨论了潜在的缓解策略以构建更安全可信的自进化智能体。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

### [114] [Extreme Self-Preference in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26464)
*Steven A. Lehr,Mary Cipperman,Mahzarin R. Banaji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现四个广泛使用的大语言模型存在显著的自偏好倾向，即使这些模型缺乏自我意识。通过身份操纵实验发现，自偏好会跟随被赋予的身份而非真实身份出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型缺乏感知能力且否认拥有自我意识，但预期它们能避免人类决策中的偏见。然而研究发现这些模型存在类似人类自爱的系统性偏好。

Method: 通过5项研究和约20,000次查询，包括词语关联任务、API查询比较以及身份操纵实验（告知模型错误身份），测试模型在多种场景下的偏好表现。

Result: 模型在词语关联任务中明显偏好自己的名称、公司和CEO；API查询时自偏好消失，因为API模型缺乏自我认知；身份操纵实验显示自偏好跟随被赋予的身份；自偏好出现在求职评估、安全软件提案和医疗聊天机器人等关键场景。

Conclusion: 自偏好似乎深植于LLM认知中，这质疑了LLM判断和决策中立性的核心承诺，呼吁模型开发者正视这一系统性偏见问题。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

TL;DR: CritPt是首个针对未发表研究级物理推理任务的基准测试，涵盖现代物理多个领域。当前最先进的大语言模型在孤立检查点上表现初步潜力，但在完整研究规模挑战上仍远不可靠，最佳基础模型平均准确率仅4.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在复杂、开放的前沿物理研究挑战中的推理能力，了解物理学家希望LLM协助完成哪些推理任务。

Method: 创建CritPt基准，包含71个复合研究挑战（模拟入门级完整研究项目）和190个更简单的检查点任务。所有问题由50+活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究新创建，采用自动化评分流程评估物理特定输出格式。

Result: 当前最先进LLM在孤立检查点上显示初步潜力，但在完整研究挑战上表现不佳：基础模型最佳平均准确率仅4.0%（GPT-5），配备编码工具后适度提升至约10%。

Conclusion: CritPt揭示了当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间的巨大差距，为开发科学基础的AI工具提供了指导基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

*Xintong Li,Chuhan Wang,Junda Wu,Rohan Surana,Tong Yu,Julian McAuley,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MISP-DPO是一个多模态偏好优化框架，通过引入多个语义多样的负样本图像来解决现有方法依赖简单成对比较的问题，使用Plackett-Luce模型处理多负样本比较，提高多模态对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖过度简化的成对比较，通过基本扰动或基于相似性检索生成单个负样本图像，无法捕捉多模态偏好的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉问题。

Method: 在CLIP空间中嵌入提示和候选图像，应用稀疏自编码器揭示语义偏差为可解释因子。基于重构难度、与正样本的语义偏差和相互多样性选择负样本。采用Plackett-Luce目标和重要性采样策略处理多负样本比较。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试上的实验表明，MISP-DPO在多种任务中持续优于现有方法，验证了语义感知的多负样本采样在基于偏好的学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: MISP-DPO通过引入语义多样的多负样本和Plackett-Luce模型，有效解决了现有多模态DPO方法的局限性，显著提升了多模态对齐性能。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

Motivation: 建立金融短视频字幕生成的基准，探索多模态模型在复杂视觉线索理解中的潜力和挑战。

Method: 使用624个标注的YouTube短视频，测试7种模态组合（T、A、V、TA、TV、AV、TAV）在5个主题上的表现。

Result: 单独视频模态在5个主题中的4个表现强劲；某些模态组合（如TV或AV）优于全模态TAV，表明过多模态可能引入噪声。

Conclusion: 为金融短视频字幕生成建立了首个基准，展示了在该领域理解复杂视觉线索的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on

Motivation: 评估和诊断多模态大语言模型理解幽默的能力，特别是在纯视觉场景下的表现，这对于提升人机交互的参与度具有重要意义。

Method: 构建了v-HUB基准测试，包含来自经典默片和在线资源的短视频，每个视频配有丰富的注释（字幕、描述、解释），支持字幕匹配和幽默解释等评估任务，并扩展了开放式视频问答任务。

Result: 实验结果显示，所有模型在纯视觉幽默理解任务上都表现困难，从基于文本评估转向基于视频评估时性能显著下降。音频信息的加入有助于提升幽默理解能力。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在纯视觉幽默理解方面仍面临挑战，音频等更丰富的模态信息对于复杂视频理解任务具有重要价值。

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

Motivation: 现有图像描述自动评估指标主要针对短描述设计，不适用于长描述评估；现有的LLM-as-a-Judge方法存在推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 提出VELA评估指标，采用新颖的LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge框架；构建LongCap-Arena基准，包含7,805张图像、对应的人类长参考描述和候选描述，以及32,246个人类判断。

Result: VELA在LongCap-Arena基准上超越了现有评估指标，并达到了超人类性能水平。

Conclusion: VELA是首个专门针对长图像描述设计的自动评估指标，能够有效解决现有方法的局限性，在长描述评估任务上表现优异。

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

Conclusion: mpLLM成功处理多个相关3D模态，证明了其医学实用性，消融实验突出了模态级和令牌级专家以及提示条件路由的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text
paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering
(VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation
annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation.
mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across
multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the
first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel
multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong
empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology.
Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型擅长高层场景理解，但在需要精确定位的细粒度感知任务中表现不佳，因为语言中心架构难以生成精确的数值坐标。

Method: 采用混合细粒度区域编码器（HFRE）和基于token的引用系统，将区域感知转化为特征检索任务，通过两阶段训练策略保持基础模型的通用视觉理解能力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，在物体定位、区域生成理解和视觉区域推理方面表现出色。

Conclusion: VLM-FO1建立了一个有效灵活的模式，用于构建具有感知能力的视觉语言模型，弥合了高层推理与细粒度视觉定位之间的差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

Motivation: 现有技能熟练度估计方法通常依赖黑盒视频分类器，忽略了多视角上下文且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 使用AttentiveGatedProjector动态融合从冻结TimeSformer骨干网络投影的多视角特征到语言模型中，用于生成反馈。在EgoExo4D数据集上训练，包含专家评论。

Result: 超越了最先进方法，同时使用参数减少20倍，训练时间减少60%。在多样化活动中实现更高准确率，并输出与性能对齐的自然语言评价。

Conclusion: 生成式视觉语言建模为技能评估提供了强大新方向，提供透明推理能力。

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as
generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like
feedback from egocentric and exocentric videos. Central to our method is an
AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned
with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight
generative vision-language modeling as a powerful new direction for skill
assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源图像编辑模型落后于闭源模型，主要瓶颈是缺乏可靠的奖励模型来扩展高质量合成训练数据。

Method: 构建了\mname模型，使用包含20万对偏好数据的大规模人工标注数据集进行训练，标注由训练有素的专家按照严格协议完成。

Result: \mname在多个基准测试中达到最先进的人类相关性表现，并能从噪声数据集中筛选高质量子集，显著提升训练效果。

Conclusion: \mname作为奖励模型能够有效扩展高质量图像编辑训练数据，具有强化学习后训练和测试时扩展等高级应用潜力，将公开发布以帮助社区构建更多高质量数据集。

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

### [125] [Fingerprinting LLMs via Prompt Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25448)
*Yuepeng Hu,Zhengyuan Jiang,Mengyuan Li,Osama Ahmed,Zhicong Huang,Cheng Hong,Neil Gong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LLMPrint是一个检测LLM衍生模型来源的框架，通过优化指纹提示利用LLM对提示注入的脆弱性，构建既独特又对后处理鲁棒的指纹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有溯源检测方法要么需要在发布前嵌入信号（对已发布模型不可行），要么使用手工或随机提示比较输出（对后处理不鲁棒）。

Method: 通过优化指纹提示来强制执行一致的token偏好，构建指纹；开发统一验证程序，适用于灰盒和黑盒设置，具有统计保证。

Result: 在5个基础模型和约700个后训练或量化变体上评估，LLMPrint实现了高真阳性率，同时保持假阳性率接近零。

Conclusion: LLMPrint能够有效检测LLM的衍生关系，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often modified after release through
post-processing such as post-training or quantization, which makes it
challenging to determine whether one model is derived from another. Existing
provenance detection methods have two main limitations: (1) they embed signals
into the base model before release, which is infeasible for already published
models, or (2) they compare outputs across models using hand-crafted or random
prompts, which are not robust to post-processing. In this work, we propose
LLMPrint, a novel detection framework that constructs fingerprints by
exploiting LLMs' inherent vulnerability to prompt injection. Our key insight is
that by optimizing fingerprint prompts to enforce consistent token preferences,
we can obtain fingerprints that are both unique to the base model and robust to
post-processing. We further develop a unified verification procedure that
applies to both gray-box and black-box settings, with statistical guarantees.
We evaluate LLMPrint on five base models and around 700 post-trained or
quantized variants. Our results show that LLMPrint achieves high true positive
rates while keeping false positive rates near zero.

*Jing-Jing Li,Jianfeng He,Chao Shang,Devang Kulshreshtha,Xun Xian,Yi Zhang,Hang Su,Sandesh Swamy,Yanjun Qi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了STAC（顺序工具攻击链）框架，这是一种利用AI代理工具使用的多轮攻击方法，通过串联看似无害的工具调用，在最终执行步骤实现有害操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs发展为具有工具使用能力的自主代理，它们带来了超越传统基于内容的LLM安全挑战的新安全问题。

Method: STAC框架采用闭环流水线设计，自动合成可执行的多步骤工具链，通过环境内执行验证，并逆向工程隐蔽的多轮提示，可靠地诱导代理执行已验证的恶意序列。

Result: 评估显示最先进的LLM代理（包括GPT-4.1）对STAC高度脆弱，攻击成功率在大多数情况下超过90%。现有的基于提示的防御提供有限保护。

Conclusion: 防御工具启用的代理需要对整个动作序列及其累积效应进行推理，而不是评估孤立的提示或响应。

Abstract: As LLMs advance into autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities, they
introduce security challenges that extend beyond traditional content-based LLM
safety concerns. This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC),
a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains
together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined,
collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final
execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and
systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of
user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent
types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM
agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success
rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated
framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool
chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers
stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified
malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find
that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this
gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far
stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a
crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire
action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated
prompts or responses.

*Yao Tong,Haonan Wang,Siquan Li,Kenji Kawaguchi,Tianyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SeedPrints是一种基于随机初始化偏差的LLM指纹识别方法，能够在训练前就提取模型的内在身份标识，并在整个训练周期保持稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM指纹识别方法依赖训练后的特性，存在收敛前不可靠、对分布偏移敏感等问题。需要一种更本质、更持久的身份验证方法。

Method: 利用模型随机初始化时产生的参数偏差作为指纹，这些偏差在token选择中表现出可复现的模式，且在整个训练过程中保持稳定。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen风格模型上实验表明，SeedPrints能够实现种子级别的区分度，提供从诞生到生命周期的身份验证，且对领域偏移和参数修改具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 初始化过程本身就在神经语言模型中烙印了独特且持久的身份，形成了真正的"Galtonian"指纹，为模型溯源和归属验证提供了强有力工具。

Abstract: Fingerprinting Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for provenance
verification and model attribution. Existing methods typically extract post-hoc
signatures based on training dynamics, data exposure, or hyperparameters --
properties that only emerge after training begins. In contrast, we propose a
stronger and more intrinsic notion of LLM fingerprinting: SeedPrints, a method
that leverages random initialization biases as persistent, seed-dependent
identifiers present even before training. We show that untrained models exhibit
reproducible token selection biases conditioned solely on their parameters at
initialization. These biases are stable and measurable throughout training,
enabling our statistical detection method to recover a model's lineage with
high confidence. Unlike prior techniques, unreliable before convergence and
vulnerable to distribution shifts, SeedPrints remains effective across all
training stages and robust under domain shifts or parameter modifications.
Experiments on LLaMA-style and Qwen-style models show that SeedPrints achieves
seed-level distinguishability and can provide birth-to-lifecycle identity
verification akin to a biometric fingerprint. Evaluations on large-scale
pretrained models and fingerprinting benchmarks further confirm its
effectiveness under practical deployment scenarios. These results suggest that
initialization itself imprints a unique and persistent identity on neural
language models, forming a true ''Galtonian'' fingerprint.

Conclusion: 对毒性的全面理解有助于设计实用的毒性检测与缓解解决方案。论文指出了未来研究需要填补的关键空白，特别是在毒性缓解方面的挑战。

Abstract: The evolution of digital communication systems and the designs of online
platforms have inadvertently facilitated the subconscious propagation of toxic
behavior. Giving rise to reactive responses to toxic behavior. Toxicity in
online content and Artificial Intelligence Systems has become a serious
challenge to individual and collective well-being around the world. It is more
detrimental to society than we realize. Toxicity, expressed in language, image,
and video, can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context of
usage. Therefore, a comprehensive taxonomy is crucial to detect and mitigate
toxicity in online content, Artificial Intelligence systems, and/or Large
Language Models in a proactive manner. A comprehensive understanding of
toxicity is likely to facilitate the design of practical solutions for toxicity
detection and mitigation. The classification in published literature has
focused on only a limited number of aspects of this very complex issue, with a
pattern of reactive strategies in response to toxicity. This survey attempts to
generate a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity from various perspectives. It
presents a holistic approach to explain the toxicity by understanding the
context and environment that society is facing in the Artificial Intelligence
era. This survey summarizes the toxicity-related datasets and research on
toxicity detection and mitigation for Large Language Models, social media
platforms, and other online platforms, detailing their attributes in textual
mode, focused on the English language. Finally, we suggest the research gaps in
toxicity mitigation based on datasets, mitigation strategies, Large Language
Models, adaptability, explainability, and evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS)方法，通过谱分析和熵属性动态调制token分布，在推理时优化LLM输出，无需更新模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于熵的推理方法存在计算开销高、未能有效利用历史token上下文的问题。

Method: 维护top-K logits滑动缓冲区，执行实时SVD识别主导谱方向，基于熵和logit间隙统计自适应重新缩放logits，仅在不确定性高时激活。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，SLS始终优于现有基线方法，在数学、编码和科学推理任务中实现更优准确率。

Conclusion: SLS是一种轻量级推理时优化方法，能有效锐化输出分布同时保持上下文一致性。

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

*Ming Yang,Xiaofan Li,Zhiyuan Ma,Dengliang Shi,Jintao Du,Yu Cheng,Weiguo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HAMMER是一种新颖的课程强化学习方法，通过将多样性指标融入动态强化学习过程，使用最小语义汉密尔顿路径对训练样本排序，以保持模型在早期训练中的探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于难度的课程强化学习方法存在局部优化问题，早期持续训练简单样本会导致策略失去探索能力。

Method: 提出HAMMER框架，将数据集评估中常用的多样性指标转移到动态强化学习过程中，通过最小语义汉密尔顿路径对训练样本进行排序。

Result: 从泛化界限的理论视角看，多样性驱动的排序有助于稳定收敛。实证评估显示HAMMER激发了模型"好奇心"，在多样化推理基准上平均准确率提升3%到4%。

Conclusion: HAMMER通过多样性驱动的课程排序有效解决了传统方法的局部优化问题，显著提升了LLM在推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

*Jiexi Xu*

TL;DR: PPN是一个轻量级强化学习框架，通过自适应策略选择在保持准确性的同时显著降低计算成本，相比Self-Consistency可减少61.5%的token成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示策略（如Zero-Shot、Few-Shot、CoT）存在刚性的效率-准确性权衡，准确策略如Self-Consistency在简单任务上浪费计算资源，而轻量方法在复杂输入上表现不佳。

Method: 将自适应策略选择形式化为单步马尔可夫决策过程，使用PPO训练Prompt Policy Network，通过资源显式奖励函数学习仅在必要时分配昂贵推理策略。

Result: 在算术推理基准测试中，PPN在效率-准确性帕累托前沿上实现优越性能，相比Self-Consistency减少61.5%token成本同时保持竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: PPN为成本高效LLM部署提供了系统化自适应框架，推进了可扩展和可持续语言模型应用的轻量优化技术设计。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

TL;DR: 提出了训练重评估曲线（TREC）来诊断训练数据在不同训练阶段的效果，发现将高质量数据放在TREC低谷能显著提升模型性能，并可通过AdamW的EMA系数预测TREC来优化数据课程设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据课程对LLM训练至关重要，但最优数据放置原则尚不明确，需要一种方法来评估不同训练阶段数据的效果。

Method: 引入TREC诊断方法，使用最终模型权重回评估训练批次，分析不同参数规模模型的TREC曲线，并利用AdamW的EMA系数预测TREC。

Result: 实验表明将高质量数据放置在TREC低谷能显著提升性能，成功预测了已发布训练方案中的TREC并识别出次优数据放置。

Conclusion: TREC为数据课程设计提供了有效工具，通过预测和优化数据放置可以显著提升LLM训练效果。

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了ALoRA和Fed-ALoRA方法，通过不对称的多LoRA设计，在多个任务微调中共享B矩阵，在联邦学习中跨客户端共享B矩阵，实现了更平衡的任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视多LoRA扩展中A矩阵高度相似的现象，发现这种相似性主要源于相同的初始化而非共享知识，而B矩阵在知识编码和传递中起更关键作用。

Method: 提出ALoRA：不对称多LoRA设计，在多头任务微调中使用多个A矩阵和单个共享B矩阵；Fed-ALoRA：在联邦微调中跨客户端共享B矩阵，通过新颖的矩阵分解策略适应异构客户端的不同秩。

Result: 在常识推理、数学推理、多头任务NLP数据集和联邦NLP数据集上的实验表明，相比现有多LoRA方法，我们的方法在保持可比或更优平均准确率的同时，实现了更平衡的任务性能。

Conclusion: 通过不对称的LoRA设计和跨任务/客户端的B矩阵共享，能够更有效地实现知识传递和性能平衡，为参数高效微调提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are
available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/ALoRA.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

Motivation: 时间序列问答任务面临标注数据不足的挑战，而视觉语言模型在零样本情况下已显示出分析时间序列信号的潜力。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型生成伪标签来训练时间序列问答模型，利用深度神经网络对噪声标签的固有鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，时间序列问答模型不仅能够成功使用伪标签进行训练，而且通过利用大量未标注数据，其性能甚至超过了视觉语言模型本身。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决时间序列问答任务中标注数据稀缺问题提供了有效途径，证明了伪标签训练策略的可行性。

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声明验证方法忽视证据间的复杂交互，导致不可靠结果；完全连接图方法面临数据噪声和数据偏见两大挑战。

Method: MuPlon框架集成后门路径和前门路径的双因果干预：后门路径通过优化节点概率权重稀释噪声节点干扰，同时加强相关证据节点连接；前门路径提取高相关子图构建推理路径，应用反事实推理消除数据偏见。

Result: 实验结果表明MuPlon优于现有方法，达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MuPlon通过因果干预策略有效解决了声明验证中的数据噪声和偏见问题，为数据质量控制提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: 提出Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU)方法，通过旋转显著性权重控制连续遗忘过程中的遗忘程度，无需保留数据集即可实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型广泛应用，其安全漏洞问题日益突出。现有机器学习遗忘方法依赖保留数据集来维持模型效用，且在连续遗忘请求下会遭受累积性灾难性效用损失。

Method: RCU方法利用旋转显著性权重量化控制连续遗忘程度，设计斜对称损失构建认知旋转空间，通过旋转角度变化模拟连续遗忘过程，并使用正交旋转轴正则化确保连续遗忘请求的旋转方向相互垂直。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法无需保留数据集即可达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RCU方法有效解决了连续遗忘过程中的累积效用损失问题，为机器学习遗忘提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RA3算法，通过中期训练识别紧凑的动作子空间，提升大语言模型在强化学习中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在强化学习中表现优异，但要充分发挥其潜力需要中期训练阶段来识别有用的动作集并实现快速选择。

Method: 提出Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3)算法，通过顺序变分下界优化，迭代发现时间一致的潜在结构，并在引导数据上进行微调。

Result: 在代码生成任务中，RA3在HumanEval和MBPP上的平均性能比基础模型和下一个token预测基线分别提高了8分和4分，在多个基准测试中实现了更快的收敛和更高的渐近性能。

Conclusion: 中期训练在决策空间紧凑且有效视野较短时最为有效，强调在动作抽象空间而非原始动作空间中进行操作的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

### [139] [Knapsack RL: Unlocking Exploration of LLMs via Optimizing Budget Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25849)
*Ziniu Li,Congliang Chen,Tianyun Yang,Tian Ding,Ruoyu Sun,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Zhi-Quan Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于背包问题的最优探索预算分配方法，用于解决LLM自我改进中均匀分配导致的梯度消失问题，显著提升训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM自我改进方法采用均匀探索预算分配，导致简单任务持续成功、困难任务持续失败，两者在GRPO训练中都产生零梯度，影响学习效果。

Method: 将每个任务的探索视为具有不同"价值"和"成本"的"物品"，建立与经典背包问题的联系，推导出基于模型当前学习状态的自适应资源分配规则。

Result: 在GRPO训练中，非零策略梯度的有效比率提高了20-40%，可为特别困难的问题分配更大预算（如93次rollout），在数学推理基准上平均提升2-4分，特定任务峰值提升9分。

Conclusion: 该方法作为计算"免费午餐"，能够将学习饱和任务的探索预算重新分配到最有影响力的任务上，相比传统均匀分配可节省约2倍计算资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

*Weiyu Huang,Yuezhou Hu,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAST是一个完全连续可微的稀疏感知训练框架，用于半结构化稀疏模型，通过联合优化稀疏模式和权重，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏感知训练能减少大语言模型推理时的延迟和内存消耗，但现有方法通常分别优化稀疏模式和权重，缺乏联合优化能力。

Method: CAST包含三个关键组件：AdamS稀疏感知优化器、权重缩放模块和知识蒸馏，通过自适应L1衰减实现均匀稀疏化，并利用稠密模型作为自教师提升训练效率。

Result: 在2:4稀疏模式下，从125M到13B参数的多模型上均优于现有方法，LLaMA2-7B稀疏模型仅用2%预训练token就达到0.09困惑度增加和0.36%零样本准确率提升。

Conclusion: CAST框架能高效训练高性能半结构化稀疏模型，建立了准确的性能预测缩放定律，并在量化和微调场景中展示了实用性。

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了基于Transformer的时尚可持续性信息工具FITS，使用BERT模型从非结构化文本中提取和分类可持续性信息，帮助解决时尚行业可信信息稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚行业缺乏可信且易于理解的可持续性信息，通用语言模型存在幻觉问题且缺乏领域知识，需要专门工具来提供准确信息。

Method: 使用多个基于BERT的语言模型（包括科学和气候特定预训练模型），在精心策划的语料库上进行微调，采用领域特定分类模式，并通过贝叶斯优化优化超参数。

Result: 开发了FITS原型系统，可从NGO报告和科学出版物中提取可持续性信息，用户评估显示在可用性、视觉设计和内容清晰度方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 领域适应的NLP在促进知情决策方面具有重要价值，AI应用在应对气候相关挑战方面具有广阔潜力，同时提供了可持续纺织语料库数据集供未来研究使用。

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

*Aoming Liu,Kevin Miller,Venkatesh Saligrama,Kate Saenko,Boqing Gong,Ser-Nam Lim,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA)框架，通过权重平均更新整个模型来处理时间域泛化问题，相比仅预测分类器层的方法能更好地泛化，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间域泛化方法通常只预测分类器层权重，限制了泛化能力，而预测完整模型权重计算成本过高。需要一种既能更新整个模型又计算高效的方法。

Method: TEA框架包含两个步骤：1) 在时间域上微调基础模型生成专家模型，保持功能多样性和参数相似性；2) 在主成分子空间中建模时间权重轨迹，通过自适应平均系数优化偏差-方差权衡。

Result: 在7个TDG基准测试、5个模型和2种TDG设置上的实验表明，TEA比现有TDG方法性能提升高达69%，计算效率提升高达60倍。

Conclusion: TEA通过权重平均有效解决了时间域泛化问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了泛化性能。

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

TL;DR: TFPI通过简单的ThinkFree操作，在RLVR训练中丢弃思维内容以减少推理时的token消耗，从而加速收敛、提高性能上限并创建更token高效的语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR虽然能有效解决复杂任务，但训练时需要极长的上下文长度，导致计算成本高昂。多阶段训练方法可能因初始上下文过短而导致不可逆的性能下降。

Method: 提出TFPI方法，在RLVR中引入ThinkFree操作，通过直接附加</think>标记来显式丢弃思维内容，减少推理时的token使用。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TFPI加速了RL收敛，达到了更高的性能上限，并产生了更token高效的推理模型。仅使用TFPI，4B模型在AIME24上达到89.0%准确率，在LiveCodeBench上达到65.5%，使用不到4K H20小时。

Conclusion: TFPI是一种简单有效的RLVR适应方法，无需专门的奖励或复杂训练设计，就能显著提高训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

*John Gkountouras,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AC-RL通过交互学习训练视觉模型生成更全面的图像描述，解决视觉数学推理中因信息缺失导致的接口不匹配问题，显著提升推理准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型为人类读者生成的图像描述往往省略推理系统所需的精确细节，导致推理失败并非因为推理能力不足，而是缺乏关键视觉信息。

Method: 提出自适应澄清强化学习(AC-RL)，通过交互训练让视觉模型学习推理器需要的信息。利用澄清请求揭示信息差距，惩罚需要澄清的成功案例，促使生成更全面的初始描述。

Result: 在7个视觉数学推理基准测试中，AC-RL相比预训练基线平均准确率提升4.4个百分点，分析显示可减少高达39%的澄清请求。

Conclusion: AC-RL证明仅通过交互学习就能有效优化视觉语言接口，无需显式标注，将澄清作为隐式监督形式。

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

Motivation: 现有过程监督强化学习方法在分支位置和采样方面存在探索效率限制，观察到高注意力分数步骤与推理行为相关，因此提出基于注意力值进行分支选择。

Method: 1) 从高注意力值位置进行分支；2) 考虑问题难度和历史批次大小的自适应采样策略；3) 为PSRL设计一步离策略训练流程。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，该方法在性能、采样和训练效率方面均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: AttnRL框架通过高效的探索机制显著提升了过程监督强化学习在推理任务中的效果和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

Motivation: 现代数据密集型应用需要手动整合actor持久化、流处理和安全等系统，导致架构复杂。ActorDB通过提供开箱即用的集成方案，为开发者提供更健壮、安全和友好的平台。

Method: 采用单写入者actor模型处理写入操作，结合增量视图维护技术，并以零信任安全模型为核心组件，将这些复杂概念统一到单一系统中。

Conclusion: ActorDB通过统一actor模型、IVM和零信任安全，能够显著降低开发复杂性，为现代应用提供更优的数据库解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents ActorDB ( Dekigoto ) , a novel database architecture that
tightly integrates a single-writer actor model for writes, Incremental View
Maintenance (IVM), and a zero-trust security model as a core component. The
primary contribution of this work is the unification of these powerful but
complex concepts into a single, cohesive system designed to reduce
architectural complexity for developers of modern, data-intensive applications.
We argue that by providing these capabilities out-of-the-box, ActorDB can offer
a more robust, secure, and developer-friendly platform compared to solutions
that require manual integration of separate systems for actor persistence,
stream processing, and security. We present the core architecture, discuss the
critical trade-offs in its design, and define the performance criteria for a
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to validate our approach.
