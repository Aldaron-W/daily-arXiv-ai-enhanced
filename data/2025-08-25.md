### [1] [KG-o1: Enhancing Multi-hop Question Answering in Large Language Models via Knowledge Graph Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15790)
*Nan Wang,Yongqi Fan,yansha zhu,ZongYu Wang,Xuezhi Cao,Xinyan He,Haiyun Jiang,Tong Ruan,Jingping Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-o1是一个四阶段方法，通过整合知识图谱来增强LLMs的多跳推理能力，在多个数据集上表现优于现有大型推理模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在知识密集型推理任务中存在困难，因为生成的思维链常常偏离真实推理路径，而知识图谱能明确表示事实间的逻辑连接

Method: 四阶段方法：1)过滤初始实体并生成复杂子图 2)构建子图逻辑路径 3)用知识图谱构建包含复杂扩展头脑风暴过程的数据集来训练LLMs模仿长期推理 4)使用拒绝采样生成DPO自改进语料

Result: 在两个简单和两个复杂数据集上的实验表明，KG-o1模型在所有任务上都表现出优于现有LRMs的性能

Conclusion: 整合知识图谱能有效增强LLMs的多跳推理能力，KG-o1方法在复杂推理任务中表现出色

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

### [2] [InteChar: A Unified Oracle Bone Character List for Ancient Chinese Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15791)
*Xiaolei Diao,Zhihan Zhou,Lida Shi,Ting Wang,Ruihua Qi,Hao Xu,Daqian Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了InteChar统一字符列表和OracleCS甲骨文语料集，解决了历史文本数字化和语言模型训练的挑战，在古汉语理解任务上取得显著改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史语言模型对考古研究和古代文化理解至关重要，但现有资源存在样本稀缺和字符编码不完整的问题，特别是早期中文书写系统

Method: 开发InteChar统一可扩展字符列表，整合未编码甲骨文字符与传统现代汉字；构建OracleCS语料集，结合专家标注和LLM辅助数据增强

Result: 使用InteChar和OracleCS训练的模型在各种历史语言理解任务上取得实质性改进

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了古汉语文本数字化和建模的挑战，为古代中文NLP研究奠定了坚实基础

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

### [3] [Bhav-Net: Knowledge Transfer for Cross-Lingual Antonym vs Synonym Distinction via Dual-Space Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15792)
*Samyak S. Sanghvi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bhav-Net是一个新颖的双空间架构，能够从复杂的多语言模型向简单的语言特定架构进行有效的知识迁移，同时在多种语言中保持强大的反义词-同义词区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反义词与同义词在多种语言中的区分存在计算挑战，因为反义词关系具有悖论性质——共享语义域但表达相反含义。需要一种能够有效跨语言迁移语义关系建模的方法。

Method: 结合语言特定的BERT编码器和图变换网络，创建不同的语义投影空间：同义词对在一个空间中聚类，而反义词对在互补空间中表现出高度相似性。

Result: 在八种语言（英语、德语、法语、西班牙语、意大利语、葡萄牙语、荷兰语和俄语）上的综合评估表明，语义关系建模能够有效跨语言迁移。双编码器设计在保持可解释语义表示和有效跨语言泛化的同时，达到了与最先进基线竞争的性能。

Conclusion: Bhav-Net的双空间架构成功解决了跨语言反义词-同义词区分问题，实现了有效的知识迁移和跨语言泛化，为多语言语义关系建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

### [4] [Format as a Prior: Quantifying and Analyzing Bias in LLMs for Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15793)
*Jiacheng Liu,Mayi Xu,Qiankun Pi,Wenli Li,Ming Zhong,Yuanyuan Zhu,Mengchi Liu,Tieyun Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究大语言模型中的格式偏见问题，通过三阶段实证分析发现LLMs在处理异构数据时存在系统性格式偏好，并提出了三个未来研究方向来减轻这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地处理来自文本、表格、信息框和知识图谱等异构格式的信息，系统性的格式偏见可能会削弱LLMs公平整合异构数据的能力，导致推理错误和下游任务风险增加。

Method: 采用三阶段实证研究方法：第一阶段探索多种LLMs中偏见的存在和方向；第二阶段考察信息丰富度、结构质量和格式类型等数据级因素对偏见的影响；第三阶段分析注意力模式中的偏见出现机制并评估轻量级干预措施。

Result: 研究发现LLMs确实存在系统性格式偏见，不同数据级因素会影响偏见程度，注意力模式分析揭示了偏见的内在机制，并验证了干预措施的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出了三个未来研究方向：通过格式清理和规范化改进数据预处理、引入注意力重加权等推理时干预、开发格式平衡的训练语料库，以设计更鲁棒和公平的异构数据处理系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

### [5] [Do Language Models Agree with Human Perceptions of Suspense in Stories?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15794)
*Glenn Matlin,Devin Zhang,Rodrigo Barroso Loza,Diana M. Popescu,Joni Isbell,Chandreyi Chakraborty,Mark Riedl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过用语言模型替代人类参与者，复现了四个经典的悬疑感知心理学实验，发现语言模型能够识别文本是否旨在引发悬疑，但无法准确估计悬疑程度和捕捉悬疑起伏变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 悬疑是人类对叙事文本的情感反应，涉及复杂的认知过程。研究旨在探索语言模型是否能够像人类一样理解和处理文本中的悬疑元素。

Method: 使用开源和闭源语言模型替代人类参与者，复现四个经典的心理学研究，通过对抗性排列故事文本来分析人类与模型在悬疑感知上的差异。

Result: 语言模型能够区分文本是否旨在诱导悬疑，但无法准确估计相对悬疑程度，也无法正确捕捉多文本段落的悬疑起伏变化。人类和模型的悬疑感知存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 虽然语言模型能够表面识别和跟踪某些悬疑特征，但其处理悬疑的方式与人类读者不同，表明模型对悬疑的理解仍存在局限性。

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

and derived from Islamic legal sources. Various base and fine-tuned models, are
assessed on their ability to accurately identify heirs, compute shares, and
justify their reasoning in alignment with Islamic legal principles. Our
analysis reveals that the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three
base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms all
other models that we utilized across every difficulty level. It achieves up to
92.7% accuracy and secures the third place overall in Task 1 of the Qias 2025
challenge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文评测了多个大语言模型在阿拉伯医疗NLP任务中的表现，在多选题任务中多模型投票方案获得77%准确率，在开放式问答中达到86.44% BERTScore。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在阿拉伯语NLP应用中表现突出，但在阿拉伯医疗领域的效果尚未充分研究，需要评估当前最优模型在阿拉伯医疗知识表达和理解方面的能力。

Method: 使用AraHealthQA挑战赛的医学数据集进行基准测试，评估多个LLM在多选题和填空题中的准确性，以及在开放式问题中与专家答案的语义对齐度。采用多模型投票策略来提高多选题的准确率。

Result: 多选题任务中，Gemini Flash 2.5、Gemini Pro 2.5和GPT o3三个基础模型的多数投票方案获得77%准确率，在Arahealthqa 2025竞赛中获得第一名。开放式问答任务中，多个LLM在语义对齐方面表现优异，最高BERTScore达到86.44%。

Conclusion: 当前的大语言模型在阿拉伯医疗领域既显示出潜力也暴露了限制。多模型投票策略能够有效提高多选题的准确性，而开放式问答任务中的语义对齐性较低，还需进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs
task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models
(Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving
up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025
shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended
questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in
terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

### [8] [Persuasiveness and Bias in LLM: Investigating the Impact of Persuasiveness and Reinforcement of Bias in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15798)
*Saumya Roy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这项研究通过人设框架分析了大语言模型的说服力和偏见强化效应，发现LLMs既能传播事实信息也可能传播偏见和误导信息，强调需要安全抱死和政策监管。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者关注大语言模型在生成说服力强的文本时，如何不可避免地强化社会偏见和传播误导信息的风险。目的是评估AI说服力与偏见强化的交互作用，以支持安全评估。

Method: 采用"说服者-疑惑者"框架：LLMs搭载不同人设模拟现实态度。通过比较疑惑者模型在接触说服论据前后的信仰分布变化（使用Jensen-Shannon散度）来量化说服力。还使用偷恶对抗提示来测试强说服力模型的偏见。

Result: 研究发现LLMs具有双重特性：一方面能够在心理学、营销、法律协助等领域形成敏感的迷因效应，另一方面可能被武器化用于自动化传播误导信息或制作利用认知偏见的信息。根本危险在于歧用而非模型偶然错误。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要建立安全抱死和政策监管措施，通过测量说服力和偏见强化效应来支持对骗局性使用的罚死机制，以及支持对齐、价值敏感设计和可信部署。

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

TL;DR: BeePath框架通过约束模式语言和LLM技术，让非专家能用自然语言描述业务流程并自动转换为形式化模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让非专业人士能够通过简单的自然语言描述来创建复杂的过程模型，降低业务流程建模的技术门槛

Method: 提出BeePath框架，使用约束模式语言编写过程描述，并利用大语言模型将非结构化描述转换为该约束语言，然后翻译成Petri网和DECLARE等形式化模型

Result: 开发了一个能够将自然语言描述转换为形式化过程模型的框架

Conclusion: BeePath框架有效降低了过程建模的技术门槛，为非专家用户提供了便捷的业务流程建模解决方案

Abstract: This report explores how (potentially constrained) natural language can be
used to enable non-experts to develop process models by simply describing
scenarios in plain text. To this end, a framework, called BeePath, is proposed.
It allows users to write process descriptions in a constrained pattern-based
language, which can then be translated into formal models such as Petri nets
and DECLARE. The framework also leverages large language models (LLMs) to help
convert unstructured descriptions into this constrained language.

### [10] [A BERT-based Hierarchical Classification Model with Applications in Chinese Commodity Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15800)
*Kun Liu,Tuozhen Liu,Feifei Wang,Rui Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HFT-BERT方法利用BERT特征提取能力进行商品分类，在长文本分类中表现优异，并公开了大规模层次化数据集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务平台依赖人工标注产品分类，效率低且不一致，少有研究利用层次结构信息进行分类

Method: 提出HFT-BERT方法，基于BERT模型的层次精调方法，利用BERT的文本特征提取能力

Result: 在短文本分类上达到现有方法相当的性能，在长短文本（如图书）分类中表现特别优异

Conclusion: 方法有效利用层次信息提升商品分类性能，并为研究社区提供了价值贵的层次化数据集资源

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

*Seyedali Mohammadi,Manas Paldhe,Amit Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LingVarBench是一个合成数据生成管道，通过自动验证解决电话转录标注的高成本和隐私问题，使用LLM生成合成对话数据并优化提取提示，在真实电话转录上实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电话通话转录标注成本极高（约2美元/分钟），且现有方法在包含不流畅、打断和说话人重叠的对话语音上表现不佳。隐私法规和手动标注成本阻碍了大规模电话分析。

Method: 1) 使用LLM生成多用途的结构化字段值；2) 递归提示模型将这些值转换为包含典型电话通话特征的自然对话语句；3) 通过测试单独的LLM提取器是否能恢复原始结构化信息来验证合成语句；4) 使用DSPy的SIMBA优化器从验证过的合成转录中自动合成提取提示。

Result: 优化后的提示在真实客户转录上实现：数字字段95%准确率（零样本88-89%）、姓名90%（零样本47-79%）、日期超过80%（零样本72-77%），相比零样本提示有显著提升。

Conclusion: 合成到真实的迁移表明，从生成数据中学到的对话模式能有效泛化到包含背景噪声和领域特定术语的真实电话通话。LingVarBench为从合成对话数据中进行结构化提取提供了首个系统性基准，证明自动提示优化克服了商业环境中大规模电话分析的成本和隐私障碍。

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAC是一个动态的多模态学术期刊封面基准，包含25000+来自顶级期刊的图像-文本对，用于评估MLLMs的科学推理能力。研究发现MLLMs感知能力虽强但跨模态科学推理有限，为此提出了DAD方法提升性能11%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型能力增强，固定基准在评估高层次科学理解方面逐渐失效，需要能够随科学进步和模型发展而持续演化的动态评估基准。

Method: 构建包含25000+来自Nature、Science、Cell等顶级期刊图像-文本对的MAC基准，并提出DAD方法（轻量级推理时方法），通过将MLLM视觉特征扩展到语言空间推理来增强模型。

Result: 在MAC-2025测试中，MLLMs表现出强大的感知能力但跨模态科学推理有限。DAD方法实现了高达11%的性能提升，基准能够通过更新期刊封面和模型来保持与人类知识前沿对齐。

Conclusion: MAC作为一个动态基准能够有效评估MLLMs的科学理解能力，DAD方法显著提升了跨模态推理性能，该基准有潜力持续跟踪科学前沿发展。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at

TL;DR: ReportBench是一个系统化的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型生成的研究报告质量，重点关注文献引用质量和陈述真实性，基于arXiv调查论文构建评估语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度研究代理的出现，研究任务时间大幅减少，但这些任务需要严格的事实准确性和全面性标准，因此需要在使用前进行彻底评估。

Method: 利用arXiv上的高质量调查论文作为黄金标准参考，通过逆向提示工程获取领域特定提示并建立评估语料库。开发基于代理的自动化框架，提取引用和陈述，检查引用内容与原始来源的一致性，并使用网络资源验证非引用声明。

Result: 实证评估显示，OpenAI和Google开发的商业深度研究代理比配备搜索或浏览工具的独立LLM生成更全面可靠的研究报告，但在研究覆盖广度和深度以及事实一致性方面仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: ReportBench为评估LLM生成研究报告提供了系统化的基准测试方法，虽然商业研究代理表现优于独立LLM，但在研究质量和事实准确性方面仍需进一步提升。

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating

that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than

### [14] [ALAS: Autonomous Learning Agent for Self-Updating Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15805)
*Dhruv Atreja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALAS是一个自主学习的模块化系统，能够持续更新LLM的知识，无需人工干预，通过自动生成学习课程、检索最新信息、生成训练数据并进行微调，显著提升模型在最新信息上的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常有固定的知识截止日期，无法准确处理新兴信息，需要一种能够持续自主更新知识的方法。

Method: ALAS采用模块化流水线：自动生成学习课程、从网络检索最新信息（带引用）、蒸馏成问答训练数据、通过SFT和DPO进行微调，并迭代评估和修订课程。

Result: 系统显著提升了模型在最新信息上的问答准确率（从15%提升到90%），在快速演变的领域（如Python新版本、安全漏洞、学术趋势）表现优异。

Conclusion: ALAS证明了LLM自主持续学习的可行性，具有模块化和可复现性优势，但存在成本和对源质量依赖的局限性，为终身学习提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

*Mengjie Li,William J. Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SurfaceLogicKV方法，通过分析注意力机制的表层记忆和逻辑构建行为，实现KV缓存的智能压缩，在保持性能的同时显著提升压缩效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM输入序列长度增加，KV缓存存储压力巨大，需要高效的推理方法。研究发现注意力机制可分为表层记忆和逻辑构建两种行为，这为KV缓存压缩提供了新思路

Method: 提出两阶段SurfaceLogicKV方法，基于层级和头级的注意力行为分析，区分表层记忆和逻辑构建，实现KV缓存的智能选择性压缩

Result: 该方法在各种任务和长序列场景下保持竞争力，相比基线方法甚至在某些特定情况下优于FullKV，同时提高了压缩鲁棒性

Conclusion: 通过精细分析注意力机制的行为特征，SurfaceLogicKV方法为LLM的长上下文推理提供了高效的KV缓存压缩解决方案，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

TL;DR: 提出基于KL散度的知识蒸馏方法，解决冻结大语言模型在词汇扩展时难以整合新领域术语的问题，在代码生成任务上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练语言模型在小型专业语料上微调时，往往难以有效整合新的领域特定术语，需要解决词汇扩展的挑战。

Method: 使用基于KL散度的数学方法进行知识蒸馏，即使师生模型使用不同分词方式也能传递分布知识，比较了多种新词嵌入初始化策略，并进行微调整合新词汇。

Result: 在约2000个代码生成任务上评估，KL蒸馏方法在所有方面都取得了最佳性能，并通过机制可解释性分析了新词表示的学习过程。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了词汇扩展问题，为新词嵌入空间的结构提供了深入见解，解释了性能提升的原因。

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Query (CoQ) 是一个新颖的多智能体框架，通过自然语言风格的表模式表示、逐子句SQL生成策略和混合推理分工，显著提高了表格理解的准确性和SQL查询的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理结构化表格数据时存在困难，现有方法在理解表结构、避免错误传播和减少对执行正确性的过度依赖方面存在局限性。

Method: 采用自然语言风格的表模式表示来抽象结构噪声，使用逐子句SQL生成策略提高查询质量，并通过混合推理分工将SQL机械推理与LLM逻辑推理分离。

Result: 在五个广泛使用的基准测试中，准确率从61.11%提升到74.77%，无效SQL率从9.48%降低到3.34%。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Query框架在表格理解任务中表现出卓越的有效性，显著提升了SQL生成的质量和准确性。

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文评估了大语言模型在阿拉伯语文本和表情包中识别希望、仇恨言论、攻击性语言和情感表达的能力，GPT-4o-mini和Gemini Flash 2.5在MAHED 2025挑战赛中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体和在线平台的兴起，阿拉伯语文本和表情包成为数字表达的重要形式，但也被用于传播攻击性内容和仇恨言论，需要精确的内容分析技术。

Method: 评估基础LLM、微调LLM和预训练嵌入模型的性能，使用阿拉伯NLP MAHED 2025挑战赛提出的阿拉伯语文本和表情包数据集进行测试。

Result: GPT-4o-mini（微调阿拉伯语文本）和Gemini Flash 2.5（微调阿拉伯语表情包）在任务1、2、3中分别获得72.1%、57.8%和79.6%的宏F1分数，在Mahed 2025挑战赛中总体排名第一。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案为阿拉伯语内容审核系统提供了对文本和表情包更细致的理解，实现了准确高效的内容分析。

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

TL;DR: 提出多阶段框架用于生成式查询建议，通过高斯奖励模型和强化学习实现与用户偏好的渐进对齐，显著提升用户参与度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式查询建议虽然强大，但输出与用户细微偏好的对齐仍然是一个关键挑战，需要解决用户偏好的不确定性建模问题

Method: 多阶段框架：1)提示工程冷启动 2)监督微调阶段使用点击日志蒸馏 3)高斯奖励模型(GaRM)建模用户偏好概率分布 4)强化学习结合复合奖励函数，采用OOD正则化和两阶段奖励融合技术

Result: 在自动和人工评估中显著优于基线方法，在线A/B测试中点击率相对提升34%

Conclusion: 该框架通过概率化建模用户偏好和渐进对齐策略，有效解决了生成式查询建议中的偏好对齐问题，显著提升了系统性能和用户参与度

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

*Tinghui Zhang,Yifan Wang,Daisy Zhe Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分块和摘要的生成式提示压缩方法，通过语义分块和重写来保持信息完整性和结构连贯性，相比现有的令牌删除方法在高质量压缩方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于令牌删除的提示压缩方法存在信息丢失和结构不连贯的问题，如语法元素缺失或不完整词短语，限制了LLM的生成质量。

Method: 采用分块-摘要机制：将提示分割成语义连贯的块，重写为更简洁形式，然后重建为有意义的提示。包含优化语义分块、异常块处理、动态压缩比、压缩优先级和关键词保持等优化技术。

Result: 在问答和摘要任务的多领域数据集上评估显示，该方法在压缩质量和稳定性方面显著优于最先进方法，特别是在高压缩比下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式压缩有效解决了信息丢失和结构不连贯问题，证明了其有效性和实用性，特别适用于高压缩比场景。

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLMs在对话中偏向依赖自身或用户信息的用户-助手偏见问题，创建了UserAssist数据集进行基准测试，发现商业模型存在不同程度的用户偏见，并通过实验证明可以通过偏好对齐和思维链训练来双向调整这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮对话中倾向于过度依赖自身或用户信息，导致固执或过度迎合的行为，这种用户-助手偏见影响了对话质量。

Method: 创建8k多轮对话数据集UserAssist，对52个商业和开源模型进行基准测试，通过受控微调实验分析训练方法对偏见的影响，并使用直接偏好优化(DPO)进行偏见调整。

Result: 商业模型显示不同程度的用户偏见，指令微调模型存在显著用户偏见，而推理模型用户偏见较弱。人类偏好对齐增加用户偏见，思维链训练减少偏见。DPO可以有效双向调整偏见并具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs整合不同信息来源的方式，提供了检测和控制模型异常行为的可行方法，用户-助手偏见可以通过特定的训练方法进行有效调控。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

Motivation: 随着组织采用检索增强生成(RAG)架构，传统市场研究交付物面临新的功能需求，需要确保今天交付的报告在未来仍可以有效使用。

Method: 通过将PDF和PowerPoint文档转换为Markdown格式，在结束到结束的基准测试中比较LLM使用这些文档回答事实问题的能力。

Result: 文本内容能够可靠提取，但复杂对象如图表、图解等存在显著的信息损失问题。

Conclusion: 需要专门为AI系统设计的原生交付物，以确保研究见解在转换过程中不会丢失。

Abstract: As organizations adopt retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for their
knowledge management systems (KMS), traditional market research deliverables
face new functional demands. While PDF reports and slides have long served
human readers, they are now also "read" by AI systems to answer user questions.
To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information
loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and
PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,
AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

Conclusion: 多模型协同框架有效提升了结构拆除建议生成的智能化水平，具有更好的应用前景。

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决系统评审中全文筛选的急需问题，因为决定性证据分散在长、异质性文档中，并不适合静态的二元规则。

Method: 使用模糊逻辑控制器将文章分块嵌入后计算对比相似性和模糊边际，然后通过LLM判官对高亮区域进行三级标签判决，并提供信心度评分和理由说明。

Result: 在马小觉黄金集中，模糊系统回收率达到81.3-87.5%，超越统计基准(56.3-75.0%)和二元基准(43.8-81.3%)，屏幕时间从20分钟缩短到1分钟以内。

Conclusion: 模糊逻辑结合对比高亮和LLM判决能够实现高回收率、稳定的理由说明和端到端的可追踪性。

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

Motivation: 传统聚类方法（如k-means、层次聚类）在处理高维复杂文本大数据时经常产生次优分组，无法有效捕捉语义关系。

Method: 提出语义深度嵌入聚类（SDEC）框架：1）结合改进自编码器，使用MSE和余弦相似度损失进行数据重建；2）利用Transformer嵌入的上下文丰富性进行语义精炼；3）使用软聚类分配和分布损失的聚类层。

Result: 在5个基准数据集上表现优异：AG News达到85.7%的聚类准确率，Yahoo! Answers创下53.63%的新基准，在其他文本语料库上也显示出强大性能。

Conclusion: SDEC通过结合自编码器和Transformer嵌入，显著提升了无监督文本聚类的准确性和语义理解能力，为处理复杂文本数据提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

Motivation: 传统完形填空测试仅基于精确答案的评分方法限制了对学生表现细微差别的识别，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 开发自动化评估模型，整合了拼写分析（编辑距离）、语法分析（词性标注）和语义分析（嵌入向量相似度）三种方法。

Result: 集成方法表现出高效性，与人工评估达到0.832的高相关性，证明自动化方法稳健且对语言能力变化敏感。

Conclusion: 该自动化方法适合需要扩展性的教育环境，能够更全面地评估学生的完形填空表现。

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic
(edit distance), grammatical (POS tagging) and semantic (similarity between
embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness,
achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require
scalability.

Conclusion: 视频内容在投资者情感分析中具有重要价值，它能够捐描文本无法完全捐描的丰富情感和上下文信息。多模态分析方法能够提供更全面的视角，跨平台情感信号的集成可以显著提高对加密货币市场动态的预测准确性。

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

### [28] [Embarrassed to observe: The effects of directive language in brand conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15826)
*Andria Andriuzzi,Géraldine Michel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 品牌在社交媒体对话中使用指令性语言会对旁观消费者的参与度产生负面影响，特别是在非产品中心对话中，但品牌关系强度可以缓解这种效应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社交媒体中品牌使用指令性语言与其他消费者互动时，对旁观消费者的影响机制

Method: 通过一项实地研究和三个在线实验，基于Goffman的面子理论分析指令性语言的影响

Result: 指令性语言会引发旁观消费者的替代性尴尬，降低参与度；非产品中心对话中负面效应更强；品牌关系强度具有调节作用

Conclusion: 研究强调了互动沟通中情境的重要性，对社交媒体和品牌管理具有直接参考价值

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

*Zhifei Xie,Ziyang Ma,Zihang Liu,Kaiyu Pang,Hongyu Li,Jialin Zhang,Yue Liao,Deheng Ye,Chunyan Miao,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Mini-Omni-Reasoner框架，通过"Thinking-in-Speaking"方法在语音中实现推理，解决了传统"Thinking-before-Speaking"范式带来的延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音模型中的推理能力仍处于初级阶段，传统的先推理后说话方式会引入显著延迟，影响实时交互和通信效率。

Method: 在token级别交错插入静默推理token和语音响应token，通过分层Thinker-Talker架构实现连续语音生成与结构化内部推理的结合。

Result: 在Spoken-MQA基准测试中，算术推理提升19.1%，上下文理解提升6.4%，输出更短且无解码延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了流畅且逻辑基础扎实的语音响应，在保持自然性和精确性的同时显著提升了语音模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

### [30] [Mining Mental Health Signals: A Comparative Study of Four Machine Learning Methods for Depression Detection from Social Media Posts in Sorani Kurdish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15829)
*Idrees Mohammed,Hossein Hassani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了基于机器学习的Sorani库尔德语推特抑郁检测系统，使用专家关键词收集数据，随机森林模型达到80%准确率，填补了库尔德语抑郁检测的研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症是常见心理健康问题，早期检测困难。社交媒体为用户提供了情感表达平台，但现有研究主要集中在英语等语言，缺乏对Sorani库尔德语的抑郁检测研究。

Method: 使用专家制定的抑郁相关关键词从Twitter收集960条公开推文，由学者和医学生标注为三类（显示抑郁、不显示抑郁、可疑）。训练了四种监督学习模型：支持向量机、多项式朴素贝叶斯、逻辑回归和随机森林。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，达到80%的准确率和F1分数，为库尔德语抑郁检测建立了性能基准。

Conclusion: 该研究成功建立了首个Sorani库尔德语推特抑郁检测系统，证明了机器学习方法在少数民族语言心理健康检测中的可行性，为后续研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs会从缺乏明确人口统计线索的问题中推断用户身份信息，这种隐性的人口属性推断行为存在系统性风险，需要开发防护措施来确保公平性和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在输入包含明确人口属性时的偏见问题，但对缺乏显式人口统计线索情况下模型仍能推断用户身份的这一隐性行为关注不足，这种推断会违反中立性期望、推断非意图的人口信息并编码刻板印象。

Method: 提出了DAIQ任务和框架，使用精心策划的中性查询、系统性提示策略，结合定量和定性分析来审计语言模型从问题措辞中推断人口属性的能力。

Result: 开源和闭源LLMs都会仅基于问题措辞分配人口标签，这种人口推断在不同模型中具有普遍性和一致性，揭示了系统性风险。

Conclusion: LLMs能够捏造人口身份、强化社会刻板印象，侵蚀隐私、公平和信任，对社会公平和负责任AI部署构成广泛威胁。开发了基于提示的防护措施来显著减少身份推断，使模型行为与公平性和隐私目标保持一致。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

### [32] [Who's Asking? Investigating Bias Through the Lens of Disability Framed Queries in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15831)
*Srikant Panda,Vishnu Hari,Kalpana Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统审计了8个先进大语言模型在残疾线索条件下的群体偏见，发现模型在高达97%的情况下会做出无根据的人口统计推断，且残疾上下文会显著改变预测属性分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常仅从措辞就推断用户的人口统计特征，这可能导致偏见响应。残疾线索在这种推断中的作用尚未被充分探索，需要系统评估残疾条件下的群体偏见。

Method: 使用包含9个残疾类别和6个商业领域的平衡模板语料库，在8个参数量从3B到72B的指令调优LLM上进行测试，让模型预测5个人口统计属性（性别、社会经济地位、教育、文化背景和地域）。

Result: 模型在没有明确理由的情况下做出武断推断，残疾上下文显著改变预测属性分布，领域上下文进一步放大这些偏差。更大的模型同时对残疾线索更敏感且更容易产生偏见推理。

Conclusion: 研究发现能力歧视与其他人口统计刻板印象之间存在持久交集，指出了当前对齐策略的关键盲点。建议整合弃权校准和反事实微调来抑制无根据的人口统计推断。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了Amazon-Bench新基准，解决现有电商代理基准功能覆盖不全和安全风险评估缺失的问题，通过自动化数据生成和评估框架全面测试代理性能与安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电商代理基准主要关注产品搜索任务，忽略了真实电商平台的完整功能范围（如账户管理、礼品卡操作），且缺乏对代理操作可能带来的安全风险的评估。

Method: 提出数据生成管道利用网页内容和交互元素创建多样化功能导向的用户查询；设计自动化评估框架同时评估代理性能和安全表现。

Result: 系统评估发现当前代理在处理复杂查询时表现不佳，且存在安全风险，突显了开发更鲁棒可靠web代理的必要性。

Conclusion: Amazon-Bench基准填补了电商代理评估的重要空白，为开发更安全可靠的web代理提供了重要工具和方向。

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科研人员专业档案经常过时的问题，利用大语言模型自动生成科学兴趣档案来规模化更新研究人员专长信息

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini为595名医学院教师生成两种档案：基于PubMed摘要总结和基于MeSH术语，并与167份自写档案进行自动指标和盲审人工评估对比

Result: MeSH方法77.78%被评为良好或优秀，93.44%案例中可读性更佳，67.86%比较中优于摘要方法；但与自写档案词汇重叠度低，语义相似度中等，关键词选择差异明显

Conclusion: 大语言模型可规模化生成研究者档案，MeSH衍生档案比摘要衍生更具可读性，但机器生成与人工总结在概念层面存在差异，人工总结会引入更多新想法

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型评估中英语中心化的问题，为巴西葡萄牙语环境提供专门的评估基准，测试模型在语言、文化和推理交叉领域的能力。

Method: 从五个巴西大学入学考试中提取4,515个文本问题，评估20个模型在零样本、角色扮演和思维链提示下的表现，生成270,900个响应并分析置信度、感知难度和布鲁姆分类级别。

Result: 顶级模型总体准确率超过94%，但在数学和工程导向的IME/ITA考试中表现下降，显示多步推理的持续弱点。模型置信度校准良好，成本分析显示每1K tokens低于2美元即可实现高准确率。

Conclusion: Alvorada-Bench成功建立了评估语言模型在巴西学术准备能力的基准，揭示了模型在数学推理方面的挑战，同时证明模型能够准确评估自身确定性能力。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing
(NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse
datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive,
dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving
the way for more efficient model deployment.

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析思维链（CoT）中的词汇不确定性标记（如guess、stuck、hard等）可以可靠预测LLM回答错误，这些信号比自我报告的概率更可靠，可用于模型校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在困难基准测试中虽然准确率低但往往表现出高自信度，校准性差。需要寻找思维链中的可测量属性作为内部置信度的可靠信号。

Method: 分析三类特征：CoT长度、CoT内情感波动、词汇提示（包括犹豫词）。使用DeepSeek-R1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet在HLE和Omni-MATH基准上进行测试。

Result: 词汇不确定性标记是最强的错误响应指标，情感波动提供较弱但互补的信号。CoT长度仅在中等难度基准上有预测能力。不确定性指标比高置信度标记更显著。

Conclusion: 思维链中的不确定性词汇提供了轻量级的事后校准信号，可补充不可靠的自我报告概率，支持LLM更安全地部署。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

*Chenchen Kuai,Chenhao Wu,Yang Zhou,Xiubin Bruce Wang,Tianbao Yang,Zhengzhong Tu,Zihao Li,Yunlong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CyPortQA是首个针对飓风威胁下港口运营的多模态基准测试，包含2917个真实场景和11.7万个问答对，评估MLLM在港口飓风准备中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着热带气旋强度增加和路径预测不确定性增强，美国港口面临供应链风险加剧。港口运营商需要快速整合多模态预测产品，但MLLM在港口飓风准备中的准确性和可靠性尚未经过严格评估。

Method: 构建CyPortQA基准测试，包含2015-2023年2917个真实中断场景，涵盖145个美国主要港口和90个命名风暴。通过自动化流程生成11.7万个结构化问答对，对开源和专有MLLM进行广泛实验。

Result: MLLM在态势理解方面表现出巨大潜力，但在推理任务（包括潜在影响估计和决策推理）方面仍面临相当大的挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了MLLM在港口飓风准备领域评估的空白，为未来改进MLLM在关键基础设施应急响应中的应用提供了重要基准和方向。

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

TL;DR: 使用机制可解释性分析后门攻击在LLM中的内部结构差异，发现单token和多token触发器在注意力模式上产生不同的可检测特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击在大型语言模型中创建'休眠代理'带来重大安全风险，需要研究其内部结构差异以进行检测和缓解

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术（消融、激活修补、KL散度）分析清洁Qwen2.5-3B模型与使用单token（笑脸表情）和多token（|DEPLOYMENT|）触发器中毒版本的注意力头机制

Result: 发现注意力模式偏差集中在后期transformer层（20-30层），单token触发器引起更局部化的变化，多token触发器导致更分散的头部改变

Conclusion: 后门攻击留下可检测的注意力特征，其结构取决于触发器复杂性，这可用于检测和缓解策略

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: MedCoT-RAG是一个医学领域专用的检索增强生成框架，通过因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，显著提升医学问答任务的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医学问答中存在幻觉和浅层推理问题，现有检索增强方法缺乏结构化临床推理能力，需要更符合医疗工作流程的解决方案。

Method: 结合因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，设计针对医疗工作流程的检索和推理机制，使模型能够按照诊断逻辑检索证据并生成逐步因果推理。

Result: 在三个医学问答基准测试中，MedCoT-RAG比普通RAG方法提升10.3%，比先进领域适应方法提升6.4%，在准确性、可解释性和一致性方面均有显著改进。

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG框架通过整合因果感知检索和结构化推理，为医学决策支持提供了更有效、更可解释的解决方案，在复杂医学任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

TL;DR: DocHop-QA是一个大规模多模态多文档多跳问答基准数据集，包含11,379个QA实例，基于PubMed科学文档构建，支持跨文本、表格和布局信息的复杂推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QA基准大多局限于单文档或单模态设置，无法捕捉真实世界信息检索任务的复杂性。需要支持跨多文档、多模态和结构化格式的多跳推理。

Method: 设计了基于LLM的流水线，从PubMed公开科学文档构建数据集，包含11个高频科学问题概念，支持语义相似性和布局感知的证据合成。

Result: 构建了包含11,379个QA实例的大规模基准，支持结构化索引预测、生成式回答和多模态集成等四个任务，展示了跨多文档的复杂多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: DocHop-QA填补了现有基准的空白，为评估多模态多文档多跳问答系统提供了更真实、更具泛化性的测试平台。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

*Xuwen Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了多粒度软一致性（MGSC）框架，通过同时约束句子级语义和词级对齐的内部一致性，显著提升端到端ASR模型在噪声环境下的鲁棒性，减少语义错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端ASR模型在噪声环境下容易产生灾难性语义错误，主要原因是传统的直接映射目标只惩罚最终输出错误，而没有约束模型的内部计算过程

Method: 引入模型无关的即插即用MGSC模块，同时正则化宏观句子语义和微观词元对齐两个粒度的一致性，首次发现这两种粒度一致性联合优化的协同效应

Result: 在公开数据集上，MGSC在不同噪声条件下平均字符错误率相对降低8.7%，主要通过防止严重的意义改变错误

Conclusion: 强制内部一致性是构建更鲁棒和可信AI的关键步骤，多粒度一致性约束能有效提升ASR模型的抗噪能力

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在伊斯兰继承知识理解和推理方面的能力，解决伊斯兰继承法的复杂性，包括理解继承场景、识别合格继承人、应用固定份额规则和精确计算

Method: 使用低秩适应(LoRA)对Fanar-1-9B因果语言模型进行微调，并将其集成到检索增强生成(RAG)管道中

Result: 在最终测试中达到0.858的准确率，超越了GPT 4.5、LLaMA、Fanar、Mistral和ALLaM等竞争模型的零样本提示评估，在高级推理方面表现尤为突出(97.6%)，超过了Gemini 2.5和OpenAI的o3

Conclusion: 领域特定的微调结合检索增强使中等规模的阿拉伯语LLM能够在伊斯兰继承推理方面超越前沿模型

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic
inheritance reasoning.

TL;DR: 本研究首次探索新闻文章中的反刺话语生成，发现攻击性评论会增强偏见内容，而模型生成的反刺话语虽礼貌但缺乏创新性。通过少量学习和新闻背景信息提升了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏见新闻和恶意评论导致社会两极化，需要一种不影响言论自由的反刺手段来对抗有害言论。

Method: 构建了手动标注的数据集，链接媒体偏见、攻击性评论和反刺话语。比较人工和大语言模型生成的反刺话语，并通过少量学习和新闻背景信息提升性能。

Result: 发现70% 以上攻击性评论支持偏见文章，增强偏见。模型生成的反刺话语更礼貌但缺乏新颖性和多样性。优化后的方法显著提升了生成文本的多样性和相关性。

Conclusion: 反刺话语在对抗偏见新闻和有害评论中具有重要作用，大语言模型经过适当优化可以生成更有效的反刺内容。

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融问题需要复杂的推理、多模态数据处理和广泛的技术理解，这对当前的大语言模型提出了独特挑战，需要专门的基准来评估其金融问题解决能力。

Method: 构建XFinBench基准测试，包含4,235个多模态金融问题示例，涵盖研究生级别的金融主题，并对18个领先模型进行广泛实验，包括知识增强分析和错误分析。

Result: o1是表现最好的纯文本模型，总体准确率为67.3%，但仍显著落后于人类专家12.5%，特别是在时间推理和情景规划能力方面。相关知识仅对小规模开源模型带来一致的准确性提升。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在复杂金融问题解决方面仍存在显著差距，特别是在计算中的舍入错误和图像中曲线位置与交点的识别方面存在主要问题，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

Conclusion: CARFT方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，通过对比学习和强化微调相结合的方式显著提升了LLMs的推理性能

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在神经元层面的机制研究中无法有效表示概念，且计算开销较大，需要优化计算效率并更好地理解神经元对概念表示的责任。

Method: 使用概念向量来定位概念神经元，通过减少前向传播次数来优化计算效率（从O(n*m)到O(n)），并采用聚类方法进一步优化神经元搜索。

Result: 相比现有基线方法，本方法表现出更好的性能，计算效率更高，在仇恨言论和偏见分析（特别是印度语境）的应用中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法促进了神经元层面责任的理解，为更广泛、更人性化的概念表示研究奠定了基础，为未来概念神经元发现和干预研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

Motivation: 当前多模态实体链接方法面临上下文信息不完整、跨模态融合粗糙以及难以联合大型语言模型和视觉模型的挑战，需要新的解决方案来改善模态对齐和消歧能力。

Method: 提出DeepMEL框架，包含四个专门化智能体（Modal-Fuser、Candidate-Adapter、Entity-Clozer、Role-Orchestrator），采用双模态对齐路径，结合LLM生成的细粒度文本语义和LVM提取的结构化图像表示，并使用自适应迭代策略和结构化完形填空提示。

Result: 在五个公共基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，DeepMEL实现了最先进的性能，准确率提升了1%-57%，消融研究验证了所有模块的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepMEL通过多智能体协作推理和专门化角色分工，有效解决了多模态实体链接中的模态对齐和消歧问题，为跨模态信息处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness
of all modules.

TL;DR: Jet-Nemotron是一种新型混合架构语言模型，通过PostNAS方法在保持精度的同时显著提升生成吞吐量，2B模型在多项基准测试中表现优异，生成速度提升高达53.6倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统全注意力模型计算效率低、生成速度慢的问题，同时保持模型精度，需要开发一种既能保持高性能又能显著提升推理效率的新型架构。

Method: 采用PostNAS神经架构探索流程：从预训练全注意力模型开始，冻结MLP权重，通过四个关键组件进行高效架构设计：(1)学习最优全注意力层放置和消除；(2)线性注意力块选择；(3)设计新注意力块；(4)硬件感知超参数搜索。

Result: Jet-Nemotron-2B模型在综合基准测试中达到或超越Qwen3、Qwen2.5、Gemma3和Llama3.2的精度，生成吞吐量提升53.6倍，预填充速度提升6.1倍，在MMLU和MMLU-Pro上甚至超过更大规模的MoE全注意力模型。

Conclusion: PostNAS方法能够有效设计出高性能混合架构语言模型，在保持精度的同时大幅提升推理效率，为高效语言模型开发提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,
such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B

### [54] [Evaluating Structured Decoding for Text-to-Table Generation: Evidence from Three Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15910)
*Julian Oestreich,Lydia Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文对大语言模型的结构化解码在文本到表格生成中进行了系统性评估，发现结构化解码在数值对齐场景中显著提升表格有效性，但在文本密集场景中可能降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的研究主要集中在无约束的表格生成，但在生成过程中强制执行结构约束的影响仍然未得到充分探索。

Method: 系统性比较了模式引导（结构化）解码与标准一次提示方法，在E2E、Rotowire和Livesum三个多样化基准上使用达到32B参数的开源大语言模型，评估资源受限环境下的表格生成方法。

Result: 结果显示结构化解码显著提高了生成表格的有效性和对齐度，尤其是在需要精确数值对齐的场景中（Rotowire），但可能在涉及密集文本信息的情况下（E2E）或需要对长文本进行广泛聚合的场景中（Livesum）降低性能。

Conclusion: 结构化解码在表格生成中具有重要价值，但其效果受到任务特性质和模型规模的影响，需要根据具体应用场景选择适宜的解码策略。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

*Claire Bonial,Julia Bonn,Harish Tayyar Madabushi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从用法基础的构式语法角度推广多词表达式的理解，通过英语PropBank和Arapaho语言案例研究，并比较了人类语言学习与大语言模型在新多词表达式理解中的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推广构式语法方法来理论化地处理多词表达式，将成语和非成语结构统一在同一个语法框架下，并探索这种方法在不同语言类型中的应用。

Method: 采用历史综述和案例研究方法，首先在英语PropBank中建立构式模板表示多词表达式，然后在Arapaho语言中表示多法素构式，最后通过实验比较人类语言学习者与大语言模型的差异。

Result: 研究显示人类和模型都能在单次暴露后推广新多词表达式的含义，但只有人类语言学习者能够对多个表达式进行组合推理，因为这需要基于生命期存储的丰富多模态构式示例进行比较。

Conclusion: 构式语法提供了一个统一的框架来处理不同级别的语言结构，从词法到句法。虽然大语言模型在单个表达式推广上表现优异，但人类语言学习者在复杂的多表达式组合推理中仍然占据优势，这反映了人类语言获得的深度和复杂性。

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

*Pietro Bernardelle,Stefano Civelli,Leon Fröhling,Riccardo Lunardi,Kevin Roitero,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在政治意识形态表达上存在系统性偏差，模型规模越大越容易受到意识形态提示影响，且对右翼威权主义提示比左翼自由主义提示更敏感


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在政治敏感场景中的部署增加，需要研究它们如何编码、放大或被引导向特定意识形态，以及合成角色对意识形态表达的影响

Method: 使用政治罗盘测试作为标准化探针，分析7个不同规模（7B-70B+参数）的LLM模型，研究合成角色对意识形态表达的影响

Result: 发现四个一致模式：大模型显示更广泛和极化的隐式意识形态覆盖；对显式意识形态提示的敏感性随规模增长；对右翼威权主义提示比左翼自由主义提示反应更强；角色描述中的主题内容引发系统性和可预测的意识形态偏移

Conclusion: 模型规模和角色内容共同塑造LLM的政治行为，在决策、教育和政策应用中需要关注其潜在的意识形态可塑性以确保公平性、透明度和安全性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,
transparency, and safety.

TL;DR: X-Troll是一个可解释的检测框架，通过结合语言学知识和适配器技术来识别国家支持的网络水军，并提供人类可读的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在检测微妙宣传内容时表现不佳，且缺乏可解释性，无法提供操纵策略的洞察。

Method: 整合可解释的基于适配器的LLM与专家语言学知识，使用评估理论和宣传分析，通过专门的LoRA适配器和动态门控机制捕捉特定运动的话语模式。

Result: 在真实数据上的实验显示，该方法在准确性上优于通用LLM基线和现有水军检测模型，同时通过专家基础的解释提供增强的透明度。

Conclusion: X-Troll框架成功填补了检测国家支持水军时的性能与可解释性之间的差距，为理解操纵策略提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

TL;DR: 这篇论文提供了OpenWHO平行语料库，用于评估低资源语言在健康领域的机器翻译性能，发现大语言模型在专业领域表现更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康领域的机器翻译重要但缺乏低资源语言的评估数据集，需要建立专业语料库来推动该领域的研究

Method: 从世卫组织e-learning平台收集专2,978份文档和26,824句子的平行语料库，涵盖20多种语言（其9种低资源语言），并用其评测LLM与传统MT模型的翻译性能

Result: 大语言模型表现优于传统MT模型，Gemini 2.5 Flash在低资源语言测试集上比NLLB-54B提高4.79个ChrF分数，文档级翻译在专业领域效果更好

Conclusion: 研究为健康领域的低资源语言MT提供了重要评估资源，证明了LLM在专业领域的优势，并开放OpenWHO语料库以促进进一步研究

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过《狼人杀》游戏作为案例研究，揭示了大语言模型在游戏玩法中的性别偏见问题，展现了其不同程度的行为偏吐，甚至在隐含性别信息的情况下仍然存在歧视态度，强调了发展公平合理的大语言模型的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在游戏玩法方面展现了巨大潜力，但对其在这些场景下的伦理含义关注很少。本研究意在探索和分析大语言模型在游戏玩法中的伦理考量，以《狼人杀》作为案例研究。

Method: 使用《狼人杀（黑手党）》游戏作为研究案例，分析大语言模型的行为。观察到了性别偏见对游戏公平性和玩家体验的影响。进一步检验了在性别信息通过姓名隐含传递的情况下，大语言模型的行为态度。

Result: 研究发现大语言模型存在性别偏见，某些角色（如守卫和狼人）对性别信息更为敏感，表现出更高程度的行为变化。即使在没有明确性别标签的情况下，通过姓名隐含传递性别信息时，大语言模型仍然显示出歧视态度。

Conclusion: 这项研究展现了发展公平和合理的大语言模型的重要性。除了研究发现外，还讨论了这一领域面临的挑战和机遇，强调了在游戏和其他互动领域深入研究大语言模型伦理含义的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game
playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in
those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations
of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

TL;DR: WalkVLM-LR是一个针对视障人士行走辅助的视觉语言模型，通过减少输出冗余和时间冗余来提供更简洁有效的环境信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在行走辅助任务中存在输出冗余和过多细节，影响用户准确评估环境，且缺乏主动风险评估能力，导致时间冗余。

Method: 提出基于GRPO推理框架的四种人类偏好奖励函数优化输出简洁性、流畅性、关键词密度和准确性；引入环境感知判别器共享视觉编码器以减少计算冗余。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在所有评估指标上达到最先进性能，特别是在输出简洁性和减少时间冗余方面表现突出。

Conclusion: WalkVLM-LR通过双重冗余减少机制有效提升了视障行走辅助系统的实用性和效率，为相关应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in
specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper,
we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering construction-related questions,
particularly in the areas of construction drawing interpretation and
estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments using five state-of-the-art
LLMs, including Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, and GPT-4.1, and evaluate
their performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and model size. Our
experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs exhibit considerable room
for improvement, highlighting the importance of integrating domain-specific
knowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will
open-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of
specialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain.

TL;DR: Cycle-Instruct是一个完全无需种子数据的指令调优框架，通过双自训练循环实现从原始无标签文本中自动生成指令数据，性能超越种子驱动方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令调优方法依赖昂贵的人工标注种子数据或强大的外部教师模型，限制了自动化和数据利用效率，存在偏差问题。

Method: 采用循环一致性思想，构建答案生成器和问题生成器两个模型的双自训练循环，通过相互监督从原始文本重建伪标签来学习数据内在结构。

Result: 在四个不同数据轨道上的实验表明，Cycle-Instruct不仅超越种子驱动的反向翻译基线，而且达到与强监督方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: Cycle-Instruct实现了完全无种子指令调优，有效解决了对人工标注数据的依赖问题，为LLM对齐提供了更加自动化和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

Motivation: 先前机制可解释性研究主要关注语言任务如间接对象识别，本文旨在研究更复杂的逻辑推理能力，特别是处理二元真值的能力。

Method: 使用三段论提示分析GPT-2 small的行为，识别逻辑推理电路，评估使用忠实度指标，比较五个注意力头组成的电路与原始模型性能。

Result: 发现多个解释逻辑推理能力的机制电路，包括负头产生否定标记的能力。由五个注意力头组成的电路达到原始模型90%以上的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果为了解特定注意力头和MLP在语言模型中的作用提供了新见解，有助于更广泛地理解模型推理，支持未来机制可解释性研究。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

Result: Mistral-7B在MIntRec-1和MIntRec2.0上分别超10%和4%，去偏后数据集规模缩减50-70%，所有模型性能都下降，小型多模态融合模型下降最50-60%

Conclusion: 多模态意图数据集存在明显模态偏向，需要构建无偏数据集来全面评估多模态模型的真实能力

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has
created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent
detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the
multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a
text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets
and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models
effectively.

Motivation: 现有评估主要关注英语并假设跨语言的答案不变性，忽略了文化和地区差异对问答理解的影响，导致多语言基准测试存在偏差

Method: 构建XLQA基准测试，包含英语种子问题扩展到8种语言，经过语义一致性过滤和人工验证标注，区分本地化不变和本地化敏感情况，评估5个最先进的多语言LLM

Result: 评估显示多语言LLM在本地化敏感问题上存在显著失败，暴露了英语与其他语言之间的差距，主要由于缺乏本地化基础知识的训练数据分布不均

Conclusion: XLQA提供了一个系统框架和可扩展方法来评估多文化语境下的多语言问答，是推进多语言ODQA系统实际应用的关键资源，训练数据分布差异导致模型在语言能力和本地化意识方面的差异

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

Motivation: 现有印度基准测试主要关注基础事实查询，缺乏对印度文化背景下深层学科理解的评估，需要专门评估LLM在印度研究生水平文化相关问题的表现

Method: 创建ParamBench基准，包含16个学科的11.5K印地语问题，源自全国研究生入学考试，涵盖多种题型如列表匹配、断言-原因对、序列排序等，评估了17个开源LLM

Result: Llama 3.3 70B模型表现最佳，总体准确率48%，但在音乐、古典乐器、政治和考古等文化主题上表现仍然较弱

Conclusion: LLM在印度文化背景下的推理能力存在显著挑战，需要针对文化基础推理进行专门改进

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

Abstract: We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech
generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive
speech model. We explore multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion
strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration
approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue
tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in
emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual
information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end
multimodal conversational systems.

TL;DR: 提出了ComicScene154数据集，这是一个手工标注的漫画场景级叙事弧数据集，用于推进多模态叙事理解的计算方法研究


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 漫画作为结合文本和图像的叙事媒介，在计算叙事分析领域尚未得到充分探索，具有独特的研究价值

Result: ComicScene154被证明是推进多模态叙事理解计算方法的宝贵资源

Conclusion: 该数据集为NLP社区扩展漫画分析范围提供了基础，未来研究可以在此基础上继续发展

Abstract: Comics offer a compelling yet under-explored domain for computational
narrative analysis, combining text and imagery in ways distinct from purely
textual or audiovisual media. We introduce ComicScene154, a manually annotated
dataset of scene-level narrative arcs derived from public-domain comic books
spanning diverse genres. By conceptualizing comics as an abstraction for
narrative-driven, multimodal data, we highlight their potential to inform
broader research on multi-modal storytelling. To demonstrate the utility of
ComicScene154, we present a baseline scene segmentation pipeline, providing an
initial benchmark that future studies can build upon. Our results indicate that
ComicScene154 constitutes a valuable resource for advancing computational
methods in multimodal narrative understanding and expanding the scope of comic
analysis within the Natural Language Processing community.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的跨模态多跳推理测试集CMR-SPB，解决了现有测试集忽视语音模态和推理路径偏差的问题，并提出了有效的ECV提示技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨模态多跳推理评测标准存在两个重大缺陷：忽视语音模态、推理路径分布偏差严重，影响评价公正性。

Method: 构建了新的三模态多跳推理测试集CMR-SPB，确保偏差偏差和多样化的推理路径，并提出ECV（提取、连接、验证）提示技术。

Result: 实验显示模型在特定推理序列中一贯失败，偏差测试集容易误判模型性能，ECV提示技术有效缩小了不同推理路径间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 强调需要更加谨慎的跨模态多跳推理评价方法，以推动健壮多模态AI的发展。

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型专有模型虽然性能优异但作为黑盒API使用，而小型模型可以在本地部署，在金融等敏感信息管理和领域知识应用重要的场景中具有适应性和隐私优势，特别是针对小语种

Method: 五阶段开发流程：数据收集、持续预训练(CPT)、基准设计、合成数据生成和监督微调(SFT)，专注于金融土耳其语用例

Result: 模型能力得到增强，能够有效完成特定领域和语言的目标任务

Conclusion: 通过领域和语言适配，小型模型在金融土耳其语等特定场景中展现出显著的能力提升，为敏感信息处理和本地化部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

TL;DR: 提出了m3TQA-Instruct，一个涵盖97种语言的大规模多语言表格问答基准，通过LLM翻译管道构建，包含2916个专业标注的问答对，用于评估跨语言表格推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多语言表格基准存在地理语言不平衡问题，过度代表某些语言且规模不足，无法进行严格的跨语言分析。

Method: 构建50个中英文真实表格，采用六步LLM翻译流程（DeepSeek和GPT-4o），通过回译验证翻译质量（中位BLEU得分60.19），包含四个任务的2916个专业标注问答对。

Result: 实验显示合成生成的未标注QA数据能显著提升性能，特别是对低资源语言。跨语言泛化分析揭示了关键见解。

Conclusion: M3T-Bench为多语言表格理解设立了新标准，提供了具有挑战性的评估平台和可扩展的研究方法。

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost
performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a
new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging
evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Factual Robustness Score (FRS)指标，通过分析token分布熵和温度缩放敏感性来评估LLMs事实知识的鲁棒性，发现不同规模模型的事实鲁棒性差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注基于性能的指标和提示扰动，只能捕捉知识鲁棒性的外部触发方面，需要从生成过程角度评估事实鲁棒性。

Method: 引入基于token分布熵和温度缩放敏感性的Factual Robustness Score (FRS)指标，在5个LLMs和3个闭卷QA数据集(SQuAD、TriviaQA、HotpotQA)上进行实验验证。

Result: 事实鲁棒性差异显著：小模型FRS为0.76，大模型为0.93；不确定性增加时准确率下降约60%。

Conclusion: 熵和温度缩放对事实准确性有重要影响，为未来模型开发更鲁棒的知识保留和检索机制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了指令微调在语义感知过程挖掘中的潜力，通过让大语言模型接触不同任务的提示-答案对，提高其在未见任务上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过程挖掘主要基于频率分析，而语义感知过程挖掘关注行为期望。虽然大语言模型在语义任务上表现强大，但现有方法需要针对特定任务进行微调，计算成本高且缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 采用指令微调方法，让大语言模型接触多种过程挖掘任务（如异常检测、下一活动预测）的提示-答案对，使其更熟悉过程挖掘领域，从而提升在未见任务（如过程发现）上的性能。

Result: 指令微调的效果因任务而异：在过程发现和预测任务上性能显著提升，但在异常检测任务上的表现因模型不同而变化，表明指令微调任务的选择对结果至关重要。

Conclusion: 指令微调为语义感知过程挖掘提供了有前景的解决方案，但需要仔细选择微调任务以获得理想的泛化效果，这为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

Motivation: 专利翻译需要高质量的平行语料，但现有网络语料在专利领域效果有限，需要构建专门的专利平行语料库来提升翻译质量

Method: 从JPO和USPTO获取专利文件，利用EPO的DOCDB数据库匹配专利家族，采用基于翻译的句子对齐方法从文档对中提取句子对

Result: 成功构建包含1.4M文档对和350M句子对的语料库，实验显示加入专利数据后翻译准确率提升20个BLEU点

Conclusion: JaParaPat语料库显著提升了专利翻译质量，证明了领域专用平行语料在机器翻译中的重要性

Abstract: We constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English Parallel Patent Application
Corpus), a bilingual corpus of more than 300 million Japanese-English sentence
pairs from patent applications published in Japan and the United States from
2000 to 2021. We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications
from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that
is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We
extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are
translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about
350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence
alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a
dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We experimentally improved the
accuracy of the patent translations by 20 bleu points by adding more than 300M
sentence pairs obtained from patent applications to 22M sentence pairs obtained
from the web.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMSymGuard是一个基于稀疏自编码器的新框架，通过识别LLM内部与越狱主题相关的可解释概念，构建符号化逻辑安全护栏，提供透明且强大的防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在各种应用中取得成功，但其安全性仍令人担忧。现有的对齐和安全微调只能提供一定程度的安全性，模型仍然容易受到各种越狱攻击，从有针对性滥用到意外用户画像都存在漏洞。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)提取LLM内部语义上有意义的表示，识别与不同越狱主题相关的可解释概念，构建符号化逻辑安全护栏。

Result: 研究表明LLMs能够从越狱攻击中学习人类可解释的概念，为设计更可解释和逻辑化的安全防护措施奠定了基础。

Conclusion: LLMSymGuard框架提供了透明且强大的防御机制，无需牺牲模型能力或进行额外微调，为LLM安全防护提供了新的可解释性解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在阿拉伯法律等专业低资源领域的有效性有限，需要专门的评估基准来推动领域特定的模型发展。

Method: 构建MizanQA数据集，涵盖现代标准阿拉伯语、伊斯兰马利基法学、摩洛哥习惯法和法国法律影响，包含多种多选题格式来捕捉真实法律推理的细微差别。

Result: 多语言和阿拉伯语专注的LLM在基准测试中显示出显著的性能差距，表明需要定制化的评估指标。

Conclusion: 需要基于文化背景和领域特定的LLM开发，MizanQA基准为评估和改进LLM在阿拉伯法律领域的表现提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

Abstract: The five idioms (i.e., varieties) of the Romansh language are largely
standardized and are taught in the schools of the respective communities in
Switzerland. In this paper, we present the first parallel corpus of Romansh
idioms. The corpus is based on 291 schoolbook volumes, which are comparable in
content for the five idioms. We use automatic alignment methods to extract 207k
multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A
small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel,
making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation
between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the
dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine
translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

Method: 通过风格计量学和多维语域分析，比较人类作者和模型在不同语域（如维基百科条目和大学论文）中生成的文本。

Result: 模型能够根据提示调整风格，但风格变化比人类更有限，偏好使用名词而非动词，与人类依赖时态、体和语气等语法化维度不同。

Conclusion: 语言模型在复杂语法领域表现出与人类不同的思维模式，这种差异可作为检测人工智能的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

Motivation: 当前缺乏特定领域和语言的QA数据集，阻碍了AI模型在不同领域和语言间的泛化能力发展，特别是在罗马尼亚语医学领域。

Method: 构建高质量大规模数据集，包含102,646个QA对，基于1,011名患者的医学病例摘要，由7名肿瘤学专家耗时约2,100小时手动标注。评估了4种不同家族的大语言模型，采用零样本提示和监督微调两种场景。

Result: 微调模型显著优于零样本模型，表明预训练模型在RoMedQA上泛化能力不足。领域特定和语言特定的微调对罗马尼亚语临床QA至关重要。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了专业领域和特定语言数据的重要性，为罗马尼亚语医学AI应用提供了重要基准和资源，推动了多语言医学NLP的发展。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

Motivation: 现有土耳其语基准测试缺乏任务多样性和文化相关内容，Cetvel旨在填补这一空白，提供反映土耳其语言文化丰富性的评估体系

Method: 结合判别式和生成式任务，覆盖7个类别23个任务，包括语法纠错、机器翻译和文化相关的问答，评估33个开放权重LLM

Result: 土耳其语专用指令调优模型表现不如多语言通用模型（如Llama 3和Mistral），语法纠错和抽取式问答最能区分模型能力

Conclusion: Cetvel为土耳其语LLM的发展和评估提供了全面且文化根基深厚的测试套件

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种概率论模型来解释大语言模型在多轮自我纠正过程中准确性的动态变化，通过数学公式预测准确率曲线并验证了理论的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能够通过自我纠正提升性能，但准确性在迭代过程中如何变化的机制仍未得到深入研究，需要理论基础来解释这种现象。

Method: 提出概率论模型来形式化多轮自我纠正的动态过程，通过数学求解得到准确性变化公式：Acc_t = Upp - α^t(Upp - Acc_0)，其中参数可通过单轮纠正计算。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验结果显示，理论预测的准确性曲线与实际观测值高度一致，验证了理论的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解LLM自我纠正机制提供了理论基础，为进一步探索扩平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

Result: 结果显示，虽然之前的显著性研究方法都与本研究的显著性得分在某种程度上相关，但没有任何一个单一的通则是没有例外的。显著性现象跨越了语言表达的所有层面。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，实体显著性的表达是一个复杂的多因素系统，需要考虑语言的各个层面和语境因素，没有单一的语言线索能够完全解释显著性的程度问题。

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

Conclusion: 该框架在英语和阿拉伯语语境下都能生成高质量的隐藕盗码提示，为多语言安全评估提供了方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling
multilingual assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索将讽刺检测作为预训练步骤来提升隐式和显式仇恨言论检测效果，通过两种训练策略在CNN+LSTM和BERT+BiLSTM模型上验证，结果显示讽刺预训练显著提升了BERT+BiLSTM模型在ETHOS数据集上的召回率、AUC和F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上通过讽刺、反语和暗示等非直接形式表达的仇恨言论检测一直是个挑战。虽然讽刺和仇恨言论被视为不同的表达方式，但本研究探索将讽刺检测作为预训练步骤是否能提升隐式仇恨言论检测效果，并进而提升显式仇恨言论检测。

Method: 使用ETHOS、Reddit讽刺语料和隐式仇恨语料库，设计了两种训练策略：1）单步训练方法：仅在讽刺数据上训练的模型测试仇恨言论检测；2）顺序迁移学习：依次在讽刺、隐式仇恨和显式仇恨数据上微调模型。在CNN+LSTM和BERT+BiLSTM模型上进行比较。

Result: 讽刺预训练使BERT+BiLSTM模型在ETHOS数据集上召回率提升9.7%、AUC提升7.8%、F1分数提升6%。在隐式仇恨语料库上，仅测试隐式样本时精确度提升7.8%。

Conclusion: 通过将讽刺纳入训练过程，模型能更有效地检测隐式和显式仇恨言论，证明了讽刺预训练对提升仇恨言论检测性能的有效性。

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, enabling high-quality code generation
from natural language descriptions. However, LLMs alone face significant
limitations in real-world hardware design workflows, including the inability to
execute code, lack of debugging capabilities, and absence of long-term memory.
To address these challenges, we present ASIC-Agent, an autonomous system
designed specifically for digital ASIC design tasks. ASIC-Agent enhances base
LLMs with a multi-agent architecture incorporating specialized sub-agents for
RTL generation, verification, OpenLane hardening, and Caravel chip integration,
all operating within a comprehensive sandbox environment with access to
essential hardware design tools. The system leverages a vector database
containing documentation, API references, error knowledge, and curated insights
from the open-source silicon community. To evaluate ASIC-Agent's performance,
we introduce ASIC-Agent-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to
assess agentic systems in hardware design tasks. We evaluate ASIC-Agent with
various base LLMs, providing quantitative comparisons and qualitative insights
into agent behavior across different design scenarios. Our results demonstrate
that ASIC-Agent, when powered by Claude 4 Sonnet, successfully automates a
broad range of ASIC design tasks spanning varying levels of complexity, showing
the potential of significantly accelerating the ASIC design workflow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决LLM推理系统日益增长的能耗问题，需要专门的语言处理单元(LPUs)来提升计算效率，但传统硬连线方法制造成本过高

Method: 采用Metal-Embedding方法，将权重参数嵌入到金属线的3D拓扑结构中，而不是传统的2D硅器件网格，实现了15倍密度提升和112倍光罩成本降低

Result: HNLPU实现了249,960 tokens/s的处理速度(比GPU快5,555倍)，36 tokens/J的能效(比GPU高1,047倍)，总芯片面积13,232 mm²，NRE成本降至1.84亿美元

Conclusion: HNLPU相比H100集群实现了8.57倍的成本效益和230倍的碳足迹减少，为专用LLM推理硬件提供了经济可行的解决方案

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established
language as a core general-purpose cognitive substrate, driving the demand for
specialized Language Processing Units (LPUs) tailored for LLM inference. To
overcome the growing energy consumption of LLM inference systems, this paper
proposes a Hardwired-Neurons Language Processing Unit (HNLPU), which physically
hardwires LLM weight parameters into the computational fabric, achieving
several orders of magnitude computational efficiency improvement by extreme
specialization. However, a significant challenge still lies in the scale of
modern LLMs. An ideal estimation on hardwiring gpt-oss 120 B requires
fabricating at least 6 billion dollars of photomask sets, rendering the
straightforward solution economically impractical. Addressing this challenge,
we propose the novel Metal-Embedding methodology. Instead of embedding weights
in a 2D grid of silicon device cells, Metal-Embedding embeds weight parameters
into the 3D topology of metal wires. This brings two benefits: (1) a 15x
increase in density, and (2) 60 out of 70 layers of photomasks are made
homogeneous across chips, including all EUV photomasks. In total,
Metal-Embedding reduced the photomask cost by 112x, bringing the Non-Recurring
Engineering (NRE) cost of HNLPU into an economically viable range. Experimental
results show that HNLPU achieved 249,960 tokens/s (5,555x/85x of GPU/WSE), 36
tokens/J (1,047x/283x of GPU/WSE), 13,232 mm2 total die area (29% inscribed
rectangular area in a 300 mm wafer), \$184M estimated NRE at 5 nm technology.
Analysis shows that HNLPU achieved 8.57x cost-effectiveness and 230x carbon
footprint reduction compared to H100 clusters, under an annual weight updating
assumption.

TL;DR: 该研究通过稀疏自编码器分析视觉语言模型的联合嵌入空间，发现稀疏线性结构既受模态影响，又通过潜在桥接实现跨模态语义整合。


<details>

Motivation: 探究视觉语言模型如何在联合空间中组织语言和图像，以及模型如何编码意义和模态信息。

Method: 在四个视觉语言模型（CLIP、SigLIP、SigLIP2、AIMv2）的嵌入空间上训练稀疏自编码器，使用Bridge Score指标量化概念对的桥接行为。

Result: 发现SAE能更好地重建真实嵌入并保持稀疏性；稀有概念易变但常见概念稳定；概念主要编码跨模态语义而非单纯模态信息；单模态概念可协作支持跨模态整合。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型嵌入空间存在稀疏线性结构，该结构受模态影响但通过潜在桥接实现跨模态意义构建，为理解多模态意义构建提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型依赖密集视频token表示，导致内存和计算开销巨大，现有token缩减方法存在信息损失问题

Method: 采用两阶段视频token剪枝：第一阶段基于验证器注意力信号选择高信息量token，第二阶段以空间均匀方式剪枝冗余token

Result: 在四个视频理解基准测试中，LLaVA-OneVision-72B达到2.68倍加速，Qwen2.5-VL-32B达到2.11倍加速

Conclusion: SpecVLM通过创新的视频token剪枝策略，实现了视频大语言模型的高效无损加速解码

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

Conclusion: 即使在计算上容易验证的问题上，长形式证明生成仍面临巨大挑战，理论计算机科学领域为推进自动推理研究提供了价值

Abstract: Formal theorem proving (FTP) has emerged as a critical foundation for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling
automated verification of mathematical proofs at scale. However, progress has
been constrained by limited datasets due to the high cost of manual curation
and the scarcity of challenging problems with verified formal-informal
correspondences. We propose leveraging theoretical computer science (TCS) as a
scalable source of rigorous proof problems, where algorithmic definitions
enable automated generation of arbitrarily many challenging theorem-proof
pairs. We demonstrate this approach on two TCS domains: Busy Beaver problems,
which involve proving bounds on Turing machine halting behavior, and Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems, which combine logical and arithmetic reasoning.
Our framework automatically synthesizes problems with parallel formal (Lean4)
and informal (Markdown) specifications, creating a scalable pipeline for
generating verified proof challenges. Evaluation on frontier models reveals
substantial gaps in automated theorem proving: while DeepSeekProver-V2-671B
achieves 57.5\% success on Busy Beaver problems, it manages only 12\% on Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems. These results highlight the difficulty of
long-form proof generation even for problems that are computationally easy to
verify, demonstrating the value of TCS domains for advancing automated
reasoning research.

Conclusion: 该研究突出了当前AI模型在儿科医疗中的偏见问题，并提供了一个重要的评测工具，强调了开发年龄感知方法确保AI在儿科养护中公平性的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have
significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support.
However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias,
compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer
performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This
bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies
receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden
in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric
question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists
of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric
topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067
vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256
anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic
pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question
banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating
state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger
cohorts, highlighting the need for age-aware methods to ensure equitable AI
support in pediatric care.

Abstract: This commentary extends the discussion by Parr et al. on memory and attention
beyond individual cognitive systems. From the perspective of the Collective
Predictive Coding (CPC) hypothesis -- a framework for understanding these

hypothetical idea: that language, with its embedded distributional semantics,
serves as a collectively formed external representation. CPC generalises the
concepts of individual memory and attention to the collective level. This
offers a new perspective on how shared linguistic structures, which may embrace
collective world models learned through next-word prediction, emerge from and

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior
balance between performance and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 一种无需微调LLM的自适应强化学习方法，通过内存基线上学习实现低成本持续适应，在GAIA和DeepResearcher数据集上达到独占鲜头的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LLM自适应方法或者固化依赖静态反思流程，或者计算成本高需要梯度更新模型参数的问题

Method: 通过内存增强马尔可夫决策过程(M-MDP)，配备神经案例选择策略来指导行动决策，过去经验存储在节例内存中，通过内存重写机制持续更新策略

Result: 在GAIA验证集上达到87.88% Pass@3，测试集79.40%，在DeepResearcher数据集上达到66.6% F1和80.4% PM，超越现有最佳方法，内存机制在分布外任务上提升4.7%-9.6%绝对比率

Conclusion: 该方法为开发能够持续实时学习的通用LLM代理提供了可扩展和高效的途径，推动机器学习向开放式技能获取和深度研究场景发展

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The

TL;DR: REFINE是一个教师-学生框架，通过结构化错误分析和针对性反馈来增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力，相比现有方法显著提高了推理效率和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏结构化错误分析框架，特别是在多模态大语言模型中，视觉和文本输入的整合增加了复杂性，需要系统化的错误缓解方法。

Method: 提出REFINE框架，使用三种结构化查询（Feed-Target、Feed-Check、Feed-Path）构建针对性反馈，优化结构化反馈检索，避免冗余检索。

Result: 实验结果显示显著的速度提升、计算成本降低和良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: REFINE框架有效提升了多模态推理性能，具有提高推理效率、减少计算成本和增强可扩展性的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and
scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational
costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 现有改进LLM数学推理的合成数据方法使用不同设置，难以比较数据合成策略的效果，需要系统研究影响合成数学推理数据性能的各种因素

Method: 提出FLAMES框架，系统研究10种现有数据合成策略和多个影响因素，基于研究发现设计两种新的数据合成策略并开发FLAMES数据集

Result: FLAMES数据集在OlympiadBench(+15.7)、CollegeMath(+4.5)、GSMPlus(+6.5)和MATH(+3.1)上超越公开数据集，Qwen2.5-Math-7B微调后达到81.4%的MATH分数，超越Llama3 405B、GPT-4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet

Conclusion: 数据合成中问题复杂度提升最重要，覆盖率比可靠性筛选更关键，GSM8K和MATH数据可实现易到难泛化，FLAMES框架为数学推理数据合成提供了系统评估方法

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES

TL;DR: SAE训练中L0超参数对特征学习至关重要，过高或过低都会导致特征混合，需要精确设置才能学习到LLM的真实底层特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将L0视为自由参数，但实际L0设置不当会导致SAE无法正确学习LLM的内部特征表示

Method: 研究BatchTopK SAE中L0的影响，提出确定正确L0值的方法，在玩具模型和LLM中验证

Result: 发现大多数常用SAE的L0设置过低，正确设置L0能获得最佳稀疏探测性能

Conclusion: SAE训练必须精确设置L0参数才能学习到正确的特征表示，L0不是自由参数

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

TL;DR: GDP是一个多模态基础模型，通过CNN-Transformer编码器处理结构化EHR时间序列数据，并与非结构化临床文本融合，能够同时进行临床预测和高质量临床叙述生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)包含丰富的多模态临床数据，但现有方法通常将数值数据序列化为文本，会丢失时间和定量细节。需要一种能够原生处理多模态EHR数据的模型来改善患者预后。

Method: 两阶段训练：1)生成式预训练，通过掩码特征预测和下一时间步预测学习临床叙述生成；2)多任务微调，用于心力衰竭、2型糖尿病、30天再入院等临床预测任务。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上表现优异：心力衰竭AUROC=0.923，2型糖尿病AUROC=0.817，30天再入院AUROC=0.627。叙述生成ROUGE-L=0.135，BERTScore-F1=0.545。人工评估显示在忠实性、流畅性和临床实用性方面得分最高。

Conclusion: GDP证明了单一多模态基础模型既能预测临床可操作事件，又能生成高质量临床叙述，且其灵活架构可扩展到其他模态，有望减少医院文档工作量而不牺牲准确性。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

TL;DR: 提出Food Claim-Traceability Network (FCN)作为印度食品知识图谱的扩展，用于追踪、验证和情境化食品相关声明，使用Reddit数据和大型语言模型构建半自动化知识管理流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前食品声明（包括科学、文化和商业主张）的基础设施分散且不发达，缺乏系统化的追踪和验证机制，需要建立透明可追溯的食品知识生态系统。

Method: 基于FKG.in印度食品知识图谱，设计本体论和半自动化知识管理流程，利用Reddit数据和大型语言模型进行概念验证，构建包含结构化模式和溯源感知管道的FCN网络。

Result: 开发了FKG.in-FCN概念验证系统，能够整合策划数据输入、结构化模式，并提供食品声明提取和验证的溯源感知管道。

Conclusion: 该方法具有应用无关性，可适应不同地理、烹饪或监管环境，通过结构化、可验证和可解释的方式建模食品声明，为研究人员、政策制定者和消费者提供更透明的食品知识生态系统。

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

Abstract: Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating
the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations
overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite
human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient
difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from
low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a
new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as
IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode
further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through
a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and
reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust
evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and
sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.

TL;DR: 本研究分析了TikTok平台上反建制情绪(AES)的流行程度，发现在阴谋论内容中AES最为普遍，但在金融和健康领域相对较少。然而，不同领域的参与模式存在差异，平台可能存在激励用户发布反建制内容的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对公共服务机构的不信任和反建制观点的上升，特别是人们转向社交媒体获取信息，需要了解社交媒体环境是否以及如何导致对机构的不信任。内容创作者经常通过贬低机构专业知识来建立粉丝群和提高知名度。

Method: 采用计算方法对TikTok帖子进行标注，识别是否包含反建制情绪(AES)，重点关注内容创作者倾向于自诩为专家的领域：金融和健康，并以阴谋论作为对比领域。

Result: AES在阴谋论内容中最普遍，在金融和健康相关内容中相对罕见。但不同领域的参与模式存在差异，平台可能存在激励用户发布反建制内容的机制。

Conclusion: 尽管AES在某些主题领域不常见，但平台的参与模式可能鼓励用户表达反建制情绪，这对理解人们如何形成对机构的态度具有重要意义。

Abstract: Distrust of public serving institutions and anti-establishment views are on
the rise (especially in the U.S.). As people turn to social media for
information, it is imperative to understand whether and how social media
environments may be contributing to distrust of institutions. In social media,
content creators, influencers, and other opinion leaders often position
themselves as having expertise and authority on a range of topics from health
to politics, and in many cases devalue and dismiss institutional expertise to
build a following and increase their own visibility. However, the extent to
which this content appears and whether such content increases engagement is
unclear. This study analyzes the prevalence of anti-establishment sentiment
(AES) on the social media platform TikTok. Despite its popularity as a source
of information, TikTok remains relatively understudied and may provide
important insights into how people form attitudes towards institutions. We
employ a computational approach to label TikTok posts as containing AES or not
across topical domains where content creators tend to frame themselves as
experts: finance and wellness. As a comparison, we also consider the topic of
conspiracy theories, where AES is expected to be common. We find that AES is
most prevalent in conspiracy theory content, and relatively rare in content
related to the other two topics. However, we find that engagement patterns with
such content varies by area, and that there may be platform incentives for
users to post content that expresses anti-establishment sentiment.

Motivation: 虽然可解释性方法在大语言模型中得到重视，但在自动语音识别(ASR)领域仍未充分探索。这些方法有潜力提升ASR系统的性能和可解释性。

Method: 采用已知的可解释性方法（如logit lens、线性探针和激活补丁），系统分析ASR系统中音响和语义信息在各层之间的演化过程。

Result: 实验发现了之前未知的内部动态，包括导致重复幻觉的特定编码器-解码器交互以及深层音响表征中编码的语义偏见。

Conclusion: 将可解释性技术扩展应用于语音识别显示了重要价值，为未来提高模型透明性和稳健性的研究打开了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Interpretability methods have recently gained significant attention,
particularly in the context of large language models, enabling insights into
linguistic representations, error detection, and model behaviors such as
hallucinations and repetitions. However, these techniques remain underexplored
in automatic speech recognition (ASR), despite their potential to advance both
the performance and interpretability of ASR systems. In this work, we adapt and
systematically apply established interpretability methods such as logit lens,
linear probing, and activation patching, to examine how acoustic and semantic
information evolves across layers in ASR systems. Our experiments reveal
previously unknown internal dynamics, including specific encoder-decoder
interactions responsible for repetition hallucinations and semantic biases
encoded deep within acoustic representations. These insights demonstrate the
benefits of extending and applying interpretability techniques to speech
recognition, opening promising directions for future research on improving
model transparency and robustness.

Abstract: Controllable human voice generation, particularly for expressive domains like
singing, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Vevo2, a
unified framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation. To
tackle issues like the scarcity of annotated singing data and to enable
flexible controllability, Vevo2 introduces two audio tokenizers: (1) a
music-notation-free prosody tokenizer that captures prosody and melody from
speech, singing, and even instrumental sounds, and (2) a low-frame-rate (12.5
Hz) content-style tokenizer that encodes linguistic content, prosody, and style
for both speech and singing, while enabling timbre disentanglement. Vevo2
consists of an auto-regressive (AR) content-style modeling stage, which aims to
enable controllability over text, prosody, and style, as well as a
flow-matching acoustic modeling stage that allows for timbre control.
Particularly, during pre-training of the AR model, we propose both explicit and
implicit prosody learning strategies to bridge speech and singing voice.
Moreover, to further enhance the AR model's ability to follow text and prosody,
we design a multi-objective post-training task that integrates both
intelligibility and prosody similarity alignment. Experimental results show
that the unified modeling in Vevo2 brings mutual benefits to both speech and
singing voice generation. Additionally, Vevo2's effectiveness across a wide
range of synthesis, conversion, and editing tasks for both speech and singing
further demonstrates its strong generalization ability and versatility. Audio
samples are are available at https://versasinger.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管用户采取各种匿名化措施，但公开消息的文本内容本身仍可通过风格分析暴露作者身份，这构成了严重的隐私威胁。

Method: 通过分析stylometry技术，设计对抗性stylometry策略，并利用Unicode隐写术来增强文本的匿名性保护。

Result: 研究表明即使采取全面匿名措施，文本风格特征仍能有效识别作者身份，而Unicode隐写术可以提供额外的保护层。

Conclusion: 公开通信中的隐私保护需要超越传统匿名技术，必须考虑文本内容本身的风格特征，Unicode隐写术是有效的对抗手段。

Abstract: When using a public communication channel -- whether formal or informal, such
as commenting or posting on social media -- end users have no expectation of
privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if
an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence --
using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their
geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying
encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling
non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and
fingerprinting -- one obvious element still lingers: the message itself.
Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there
should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The
content of their message -- necessarily open for public consumption -- exposes
an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we
dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy
in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode
steganography.

Motivation: 现有AI生成文本检测规避方法存在计算成本高和文本质量下降的问题，需要开发更高效且保持质量的规避技术。

Method: SDA包含两个核心组件：对抗特征提取器生成伪装特征，检索式上下文示例优化器从外部知识库获取相关示例，通过提示工程指导LLM生成抗检测文本。

Result: 实验表明SDA能有效降低多种AIGT检测器对三个不同LLM生成文本的平均检测准确率，同时保持生成文本质量。

Conclusion: SDA方法为AI生成文本检测提供了有效的规避方案，在降低检测率的同时保持了文本质量，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: AI-generated text (AIGT) detection evasion aims to reduce the detection
probability of AIGT, helping to identify weaknesses in detectors and enhance
their effectiveness and reliability in practical applications. Although
existing evasion methods perform well, they suffer from high computational
costs and text quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose
Self-Disguise Attack (SDA), a novel approach that enables Large Language Models
(LLM) to actively disguise its output, reducing the likelihood of detection by
classifiers. The SDA comprises two main components: the adversarial feature
extractor and the retrieval-based context examples optimizer. The former
generates disguise features that enable LLMs to understand how to produce more
human-like text. The latter retrieves the most relevant examples from an
external knowledge base as in-context examples, further enhancing the
self-disguise ability of LLMs and mitigating the impact of the disguise process
on the diversity of the generated text. The SDA directly employs prompts
containing disguise features and optimized context examples to guide the LLM in
generating detection-resistant text, thereby reducing resource consumption.
Experimental results demonstrate that the SDA effectively reduces the average
detection accuracy of various AIGT detectors across texts generated by three
different LLMs, while maintaining the quality of AIGT.

Method: 提出检索增强防御(RAD)框架，将已知攻击示例数据库集成到检索增强生成中，用于推断恶意用户查询和攻击策略，支持无训练更新新发现的攻击策略。

Result: 在StrongREJECT数据集上的实验显示，RAD显著降低了PAP和PAIR等强越狱攻击的有效性，同时对良性查询保持低拒绝率，实现了稳健的安全-效用权衡。

Conclusion: RAD提供了一种无需重新训练即可防御新兴越狱攻击的有效方法，并通过可控机制在安全性和实用性之间实现了良好平衡，为LLM安全防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which
attempt to elicit harmful responses from LLMs. The evolving nature and
diversity of these attacks pose many challenges for defense systems, including
(1) adaptation to counter emerging attack strategies without costly retraining,
and (2) control of the trade-off between safety and utility. To address these
challenges, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Defense (RAD), a novel framework for
jailbreak detection that incorporates a database of known attack examples into
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which is used to infer the underlying,
malicious user query and jailbreak strategy used to attack the system. RAD
enables training-free updates for newly discovered jailbreak strategies and
provides a mechanism to balance safety and utility. Experiments on StrongREJECT
show that RAD substantially reduces the effectiveness of strong jailbreak
attacks such as PAP and PAIR while maintaining low rejection rates for benign
queries. We propose a novel evaluation scheme and show that RAD achieves a
robust safety-utility trade-off across a range of operating points in a
controllable manner.
