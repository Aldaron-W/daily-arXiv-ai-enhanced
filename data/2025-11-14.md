TL;DR: Omnilingual ASR是一个可扩展的大规模语音识别系统，能够通过少量数据样本支持未服务的语言，覆盖1600多种语言，其中500多种是首次获得ASR支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高资源语言ASR快速发展而大多数语言（7000+）缺乏支持的问题，突破传统架构限制，以社区合作方式扩展语言覆盖。

Method: 采用70亿参数的自监督预训练学习鲁棒语音表示，引入编码器-解码器架构实现零样本泛化，利用LLM启发的解码器，结合大规模多样化训练语料。

Result: 在自动评估中显示显著优于现有系统，尤其在低资源条件下表现优异，具有强大的泛化能力。发布从3亿到70亿参数的模型系列。

Conclusion: 开源模型和工具可以降低研究者和社区的参与门槛，促进新的参与形式，同时考虑了伦理考量和社会影响。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has advanced in high-resource languages, but most of the world's 7,000+ languages remain unsupported, leaving thousands of long-tail languages behind. Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation.

### [2] [Order Matters: Rethinking Prompt Construction in In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09700)
*Warren Li,Yiqian Wang,Zihan Wang,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现示例排序对上下文学习性能的影响与示例选择相当，两者同等重要且相互交织，需要重新审视ICL中的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视ICL中示例选择比排序更重要的常见假设，系统比较选择和排序对性能的影响。

Method: 在分类和生成任务上进行受控实验，使用多个开源模型家族和GPT-5，分析不同示例排序对性能方差的影响。

Result: 发现不同示例排序导致的性能方差与使用完全不同示例集相当，且通过开发集可以识别强排序，性能接近基于测试标签的最佳排序。

Conclusion: 示例选择和排序在提示设计中具有同等且相互交织的重要性，需要重新审视ICL中的假设。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to perform new tasks by conditioning on a sequence of examples. Most prior work reasonably and intuitively assumes that which examples are chosen has a far greater effect on performance than how those examples are ordered, leading to a focus on example selection. We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels. Our findings highlight the equal and intertwined importance of example selection and ordering in prompt design, calling for a reexamination of the assumptions held in ICL.

### [3] [Contextual morphologically-guided tokenization for Latin encoder models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09709)
*Marisa Hudspeth,Patrick J. Burns,Brendan O'Connor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了针对拉丁语的形态感知分词方法，发现形态引导的分词能提升下游任务性能，特别是在领域外文本上表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分词方法通常优先考虑信息理论目标而非语言学目标，对形态丰富的语言效果不佳。拉丁语作为形态丰富的语言，具有中等规模的预训练数据但丰富的词汇资源，这种差异在低资源语言建模讨论中常被忽视。

Method: 采用形态感知的分词方法，利用拉丁语丰富的词汇资源来改进分词过程。

Result: 形态引导的分词在四个下游任务上提升了整体性能，特别是在领域外文本上表现更突出，显示了模型改进的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 语言资源对于改进形态复杂语言的语言建模具有实用性。对于缺乏大规模预训练数据的低资源语言，开发和整合语言资源可以作为提升语言模型性能的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical component of language model pretraining, yet standard tokenization methods often prioritize information-theoretical goals like high compression and low fertility rather than linguistic goals like morphological alignment. In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages. For low-resource languages that lack large-scale pretraining data, the development and incorporation of linguistic resources can serve as a feasible alternative to improve LM performance.

*C. LeMay,A. Lane,J. Seales,M. Winstead,S. Baty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了NLP在提取总统指令中信号主题的应用，发现NLP与人工分析存在差异，需要进一步验证NLP在此类应用中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索NLP在处理大规模书面语料库中的潜力，特别是在识别总统指令中的信号主题方面，以辅助社会科学研究。

Method: 使用NLP技术从里根到克林顿政府的总统指令中提取主要主题，并与分析师的人工识别结果进行比较。

Result: NLP和人工分析都能识别相关文档，但两者结果存在差异，表明需要更多研究来验证NLP在此类应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: 虽然NLP在处理大规模语料库方面具有潜力，但由于AI/ML技术快速发展，现有工具可能已过时，需要持续评估和改进NLP在社会科学应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Our research investigates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to extract main topics from a larger corpus of written data, as applied to the case of identifying signaling themes in Presidential Directives (PDs) from the Reagan through Clinton administrations. Analysts and NLP both identified relevant documents, demonstrating the potential utility of NLPs in research involving large written corpuses. However, we also identified discrepancies between NLP and human-labeled results that indicate a need for more research to assess the validity of NLP in this use case. The research was conducted in 2023, and the rapidly evolving landscape of AIML means existing tools have improved and new tools have been developed; this research displays the inherent capabilities of a potentially dated AI tool in emerging social science applications.

### [5] [How Small Can You Go? Compact Language Models for On-Device Critical Error Detection in Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09748)
*Muskaan Chopra,Lorenz Sparrenberg,Sarthak Khanna,Rafet Sifa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现约10亿参数的轻量级语言模型（如Gemma-3-1B）在机器翻译关键错误检测任务中能提供最佳的质量效率平衡，通过轻量级校准和小样本监督可实现可信赖的本地化错误检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在机器翻译评估方面表现出色，但其规模和成本限制了在边缘设备和隐私敏感工作流中的部署，需要探索更小模型的有效性。

Method: 使用小于20亿参数的模型进行英语到德语关键错误检测基准测试，采用标准化提示、轻量级logit-bias校准和多数投票方法，评估语义质量和计算效率。

Result: Gemma-3-1B在SynCED-EnDe-2025数据集上达到MCC=0.77和F1-ERR=0.98，在MacBook Pro M4 Pro上保持400ms单样本延迟；Qwen-3-1.7B获得最高MCC但计算成本更高。

Conclusion: 紧凑的指令调优LLM结合轻量级校准和小样本监督，可为机器翻译提供可信赖的本地化关键错误检测，实现隐私保护、低成本的实时错误筛查。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at evaluating machine translation (MT), but their scale and cost hinder deployment on edge devices and in privacy-sensitive workflows. We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors. Overall, compact, instruction-tuned LLMs augmented with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy, on-device CED for MT, enabling private, low-cost error screening in real-world translation pipelines. All datasets, prompts, and scripts are publicly available at our GitHub repository.

### [6] [Predicate-Argument Structure Divergences in Chinese and English Parallel Sentences and their Impact on Language Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09796)
*Rocco Tripodi,Xiaoyu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了中英文平行句子中的谓词-论元结构，发现语言迁移具有不对称性，源语言的选择对跨语言NLP应用至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言NLP在低资源语言场景中具有重要价值，但语言差异（特别是类型学上相距较远的语言）阻碍了语言迁移效果。本文旨在分析中英文谓词-论元结构的对齐情况。

Method: 通过注释投影实验，分别以中文和英文作为源语言，将注释投影到对应的平行句子中，进行定性和定量分析。

Result: 语言迁移具有明显的不对称性，不同源语言选择会导致不同的迁移效果。

Conclusion: 在跨语言NLP应用中，源语言的选择需要仔细考虑，这一不对称性需要在提出任何跨语言NLP科学主张前进行深入研究。

Abstract: Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained significant traction in recent years, offering practical solutions in low-resource settings by transferring linguistic knowledge from resource-rich to low-resource languages. This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric. An aspect that requires attention when it comes to selecting the source language in transfer learning applications and that needs to be investigated before any scientific claim about cross-lingual NLP is proposed.

### [7] [TARG: Training-Free Adaptive Retrieval Gating for Efficient RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09803)
*Yufeng Wang,Lu wei,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TARG是一种无需训练的检索门控方法，通过基础模型生成的简短草稿计算轻量级不确定性分数，仅在分数超过阈值时触发检索，显著减少检索次数和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成(RAG)虽然提高了事实准确性，但每次查询都检索会降低质量、增加令牌数量和延迟。

Method: 从基础模型的简短无上下文草稿中，通过前缀对数计算轻量级不确定性分数：平均令牌熵、基于top-1/top-2对数间隙的边际信号，或少量随机前缀的小N方差。

Result: 在NQ-Open、TriviaQA和PopQA数据集上，TARG与Always-RAG相比，在保持或提高EM/F1的同时，减少了70-90%的检索次数，并降低了端到端延迟。

Conclusion: TARG通过自适应检索门控有效平衡了准确性和效率，边际信号是现代指令调优LLM下的稳健默认选择，小N方差提供了保守的预算优先替代方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factuality but retrieving for every query often hurts quality while inflating tokens and latency. We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative. We provide ablations over gate type and prefix length and use a delta-latency view to make budget trade-offs explicit.

### [8] [Khmer Spellchecking: A Holistic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09812)
*Marry Kong,Rina Buoy,Sovisal Chenda,Nguonly Taing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成高棉语子词分割、命名实体识别、字形转音素转换和语言模型的整体拼写检查方法，在基准测试中达到94.4%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高棉语拼写检查面临词汇表与分词模型不匹配、单词形式多样、复合词生成灵活、专有名词误判等问题，现有解决方案无法充分应对这些挑战

Method: 整合高棉语子词分割、命名实体识别、字形转音素转换和语言模型，通过识别潜在修正候选并排序最优候选来解决拼写检查问题

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在高棉语拼写检查任务中达到94.4%的最先进准确率，优于现有解决方案

Conclusion: 提出的整体方法有效解决了高棉语拼写检查的多重挑战，并建立了公开可用的高棉语拼写检查和命名实体识别基准数据集

Abstract: Compared to English and other high-resource languages, spellchecking for Khmer remains an unresolved problem due to several challenges. First, there are misalignments between words in the lexicon and the word segmentation model. Second, a Khmer word can be written in different forms. Third, Khmer compound words are often loosely and easily formed, and these compound words are not always found in the lexicon. Fourth, some proper nouns may be flagged as misspellings due to the absence of a Khmer named-entity recognition (NER) model. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not adequately address these challenges. This paper proposes a holistic approach to the Khmer spellchecking problem by integrating Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer NER, Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to tackle these challenges, identify potential correction candidates, and rank the most suitable candidate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art Khmer spellchecking accuracy of up to 94.4%, compared to existing solutions. The benchmark datasets for Khmer spellchecking and NER tasks in this study will be made publicly available.

Result: 通过迭代原型设计和用户反馈优化，系统能够提供个性化的课程推荐。

Conclusion: 该系统可作为学生、教师和职业顾问的有用工具，促进终身学习和职业发展，改善大学毕业生就业结果。

Abstract: This paper aims to address the challenge of selecting relevant courses for students by proposing the design and development of a course recommendation system. The course recommendation system utilises a combination of data analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms to recommend courses that align with current industry trends and requirements. In order to provide customised suggestions, the study entails the design and implementation of an extensive algorithmic framework that combines machine learning methods, user preferences, and academic criteria. The system employs data mining and collaborative filtering techniques to examine past courses and individual career goals in order to provide course recommendations. Moreover, to improve the accessibility and usefulness of the recommendation system, special attention is given to the development of an easy-to-use front-end interface. The front-end design prioritises visual clarity, interaction, and simplicity through iterative prototyping and user input revisions, guaranteeing a smooth and captivating user experience. We refined and optimised the proposed system by incorporating user feedback, ensuring that it effectively meets the needs and preferences of its target users. The proposed course recommendation system could be a useful tool for students, instructors, and career advisers to use in promoting lifelong learning and professional progression as it fills the gap between university learning and industry expectations. We hope that the proposed course recommendation system will help university students in making data-drive and industry-informed course decisions, in turn, improving graduate outcomes for the university sector.

*Neo Wang,Sonit Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于RAG方法的LLM问答系统，用于解决课程论坛中学生问题回复延迟和重复问题，通过微调开源LLM和本地知识库检索来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程论坛中学生问题数量增加导致回复延迟和重复问题频发，需要自动化解决方案来减轻教师负担。

Method: 使用开源大语言模型微调，结合检索增强生成(RAG)方法从本地知识库检索相关文档，并集成多链思维推理来减少幻觉问题。

Result: 在HotpotQA数据集上的实验表明，微调后的LLM结合RAG方法在问答任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: 基于RAG的LLM问答系统能有效解决课程论坛中的问题回复挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The course forums are increasingly significant and play vital role in facilitating student discussions and answering their questions related to the course. It provides a platform for students to post their questions related to the content and admin issues related to the course. However, there are several challenges due to the increase in the number of students enrolled in the course. The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLM with RAG method has a strong performance on question answering task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TermGPT是一个多级对比微调框架，通过构建句子图和生成语义一致但具有区分性的正负样本，在句子和标记级别进行对比学习，以解决LLM在专业领域术语表示上的各向同性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在专业领域（如法律和金融）的术语级表示存在各向同性问题，导致对领域特定术语的区分能力不足，这严重影响了法律判决预测和金融风险分析等下游任务。

Method: 首先构建句子图来捕捉语义和结构关系，基于上下文和拓扑线索生成语义一致但具有区分性的正负样本；然后设计句子和标记级别的多级对比学习方法，增强全局上下文理解和细粒度术语区分能力。

Result: 实验表明，TermGPT在金融和法律领域的术语区分任务中优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: TermGPT通过多级对比学习框架有效解决了LLM在专业领域术语表示的各向同性问题，显著提升了术语区分能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in text generation tasks; however, their embedding spaces often suffer from the isotropy problem, resulting in poor discrimination of domain-specific terminology, particularly in legal and financial contexts. This weakness in terminology-level representation can severely hinder downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis, where subtle semantic distinctions are critical. To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues. We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination. To support robust evaluation, we construct the first financial terminology dataset derived from official regulatory documents. Experiments show that TermGPT outperforms existing baselines in term discrimination tasks within the finance and legal domains.

*Mingye Zhu,Yi Liu,Zheren Fu,Quan Wang,Yongdong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InTRO是一个新的框架，通过token级探索和自反馈来解决LLM链式思维推理训练中的泛化问题，在数学推理基准上显著提升准确率并减少冗长性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调会惩罚同样有效的替代推理路径，而强化学习存在信用分配困难和计算成本高的问题，需要一种更好的链式思维推理训练方法。

Method: 使用修正因子（基于生成策略与其答案条件对应策略之间的信息差异估计的token级重要性权重）来进行信息丰富的下一个token选择，实现token级探索和自反馈。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准上，InTRO相比基线方法持续表现更好，将解决方案准确率相对基础模型提升高达20%，推理链更简洁，并展示出跨领域迁移能力。

Conclusion: InTRO框架通过token级优化实现了准确简洁的推理，在数学推理任务上表现出色，并具有向其他领域推广的潜力。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for chain-of-thought reasoning presents a significant challenge: supervised fine-tuning on a single "golden" rationale hurts generalization as it penalizes equally valid alternatives, whereas reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards struggles with credit assignment and prohibitive computational cost. To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity. Beyond this, InTRO enables cross-domain transfer, successfully adapting to out-of-domain reasoning tasks that extend beyond the realm of mathematics, demonstrating robust generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HierRouter是一种分层路由方法，通过动态组装专用轻量级语言模型来提升LLM推理性能，在保持低成本的同时将响应质量提高达2.4倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能优异，但计算和内存成本高昂，限制了在资源受限或实时场景中的部署。

Method: 将问题建模为有限时域马尔可夫决策过程，训练基于PPO的强化学习代理在多跳推理的每个阶段迭代选择要调用的模型，基于上下文和累积成本做出路由决策。

Result: 在六个基准测试（包括问答、代码生成和数学推理）中，HierRouter相比独立使用单个模型将响应质量提高达2.4倍，而平均仅产生最小的额外推理成本。

Conclusion: 分层路由为成本高效、高性能的LLM推理提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art performance across many tasks but impose high computational and memory costs, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained or real-time settings. To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average. These results highlight the promise of hierarchical routing for cost-efficient, high-performance LLM inference. All codes can be found here https://github.com/ Nikunj-Gupta/hierouter.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnchTable是一个新颖框架，通过NTK安全向量蒸馏和干扰感知合并技术，在微调LLM时保持安全对齐，防止有害输出，同时最小化性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM微调过程会系统性地削弱安全对齐，导致伦理准则失效和有害输出风险增加，需要解决这一关键漏洞。

Method: 使用基于神经正切核的安全向量蒸馏方法解耦安全约束与任务特定推理，结合干扰感知合并技术平衡安全性和实用性。

Result: 在11个不同数据集上的评估显示，EnchTable实现了显著更低的不安全率、更高的效用分数，并能抵抗静态和动态越狱攻击。

Conclusion: EnchTable能有效维持LLM的安全对齐，具有通用适用性，可无缝集成到各种部署流程中，且性能损失最小。

Abstract: Many machine learning models are fine-tuned from large language models (LLMs) to achieve high performance in specialized domains like code generation, biomedical analysis, and mathematical problem solving. However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains. Additionally, we validate EnchTable can be seamlessly integrated into various deployment pipelines without significant overhead.

Motivation: 为听力障碍人士的日常交流提供统一灵活的解决方案，将Omni-Model范式引入辅助技术领域。

Method: 构建全面的预处理流程（面部关键点检测、唇部区域隔离稳定、多模态样本质量评估），采用课程学习策略，使用SigLIP编码器和Unified 3D-Resampler高效编码高帧率唇部运动。

Result: 在专门构建的HI-Dialogue数据集上，HI-TransPA在字面准确性和语义保真度方面均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 为将Omni-Model应用于辅助通信技术奠定了基础，提供了端到端建模框架和必要的处理工具。

Abstract: To provide a unified and flexible solution for daily communication among hearing-impaired individuals, we introduce the Omni-Model paradigm into assistive technology and present HI-TransPA, an instruction-driven audio-visual personal assistant. The model fuses indistinct speech with high-frame-rate lip dynamics, enabling both translation and dialogue within a single multimodal framework. To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness. We further adopt a SigLIP encoder combined with a Unified 3D-Resampler to efficiently encode high-frame-rate lip motion. Experiments on our purpose-built HI-Dialogue dataset show that HI-TransPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both literal accuracy and semantic fidelity. This work establishes a foundation for applying Omni-Models to assistive communication technology, providing an end-to-end modeling framework and essential processing tools for future research.

TL;DR: 提出了Norm-RAG框架，通过检索增强和语义分块技术在多轮对话中进行细粒度的社会规范推理，并引入了多语言对话数据集MINDS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会规范推理具有主观性、上下文依赖性和跨文化差异，现有方法主要针对孤立话语或合成对话，难以捕捉真实对话的流动性。

Method: 开发Norm-RAG框架，建模话语级属性（沟通意图、说话者角色、人际框架、语言线索），通过语义分块检索结构化规范文档，实现可解释的规范推理。

Result: 实验表明Norm-RAG改进了规范检测和泛化能力，提升了文化适应性和社交智能对话系统的性能。

Conclusion: Norm-RAG框架能够有效处理多语言对话中的社会规范推理，为开发更具文化适应性的对话系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Social norms are implicit, culturally grounded expectations that guide interpersonal communication. Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression. Our experiments show that Norm-RAG improves norm detection and generalization, demonstrates improved performance for culturally adaptive and socially intelligent dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过扩展LLM提示策略到646个选择题，发现单纯使用GPT-4o-mini生成知识组件效果不如专家设计，且产生过多冗余标签。提出基于余弦相似度的语义合并方法，在0.8阈值下将KC数量从569减少到428，同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识组件(KCs)是自适应学习系统的核心，但人工识别成本高。虽然LLM有望自动化此过程，但现有研究存在数据集小、产生冗余标签的问题。

Method: 1. 扩展"模拟教科书"LLM提示策略到646个选择题数据集；2. 提出基于余弦相似度的语义相似KC标签合并方法；3. 评估不同相似度阈值下的性能。

Result: 初始LLM方法表现差于专家模型(RMSE 0.4285 vs 0.4206)，生成过多KCs(569 vs 101)。使用余弦相似度0.8阈值合并后，KC数量降至428，RMSE改善至0.4259。

Conclusion: 单独使用扩展的LLM生成不足够，但结合语义合并技术可为知识组件自动识别和优化提供可行路径。

Abstract: Knowledge Components (KCs) are foundational to adaptive learning systems, but their manual identification by domain experts is a significant bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a "simulated textbook" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.

TL;DR: 提出了REAP方法，通过子任务规划器和事实提取器模块来增强多跳推理任务中的全局规划和内容利用，显著提升了推理的准确性和可追溯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在多跳推理任务中缺乏全局规划，容易陷入局部推理困境，且对检索内容的利用不足，忽视潜在线索，影响推理结果的准确性。

Method: 提出递归评估和自适应规划(REAP)方法，包含子任务规划器(SP)和事实提取器(FE)模块。SP维护全局视角，指导推理方向并评估任务状态；FE对检索内容进行细粒度分析，提取可靠答案和线索。两个模块协同工作，逐步丰富全局知识表示。

Result: 在多个公开多跳数据集上的实验表明，该方法在域内和域外设置下均显著优于现有RAG方法，验证了其在复杂多跳推理任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: REAP方法通过结构化子任务和事实维护，结合统一的任务范式设计，有效提升了多跳推理的可靠性和可追溯性，为解决复杂推理任务提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been extensively employed to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple public multi-hop datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing RAG methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, validating its effectiveness in complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 对最先进语言模型在数值声明验证任务上的系统性评估显示，即使领先的专有系统在特定扰动下准确率下降高达62%，没有模型在所有条件下都表现稳健。增加上下文长度通常降低准确率，但用扰动演示丰富扩展上下文后，大多数模型能显著恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型任务上表现强劲，但在数值推理方面存在困难，需要系统评估其在数值声明验证任务上的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用受控扰动（包括标签翻转探针）对最先进模型在数值声明和证据对上的真实性预测进行系统性评估，测试上下文长度和扰动演示的影响。

Result: 所有模型在特定扰动下准确率显著下降（最高62%），没有模型在所有条件下都表现稳健。增加上下文长度通常降低准确率，但用扰动演示丰富扩展上下文后，大多数模型能显著恢复性能。

Conclusion: 数值事实核查存在关键局限性，鲁棒性仍然是当前语言模型面临的开放挑战。

Abstract: Large language models show strong performance on knowledge intensive tasks such as fact-checking and question answering, yet they often struggle with numerical reasoning. We present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models for veracity prediction on numerical claims and evidence pairs using controlled perturbations, including label-flipping probes, to test robustness. Our results indicate that even leading proprietary systems experience accuracy drops of up to 62\% under certain perturbations. No model proves to be robust across all conditions. We further find that increasing context length generally reduces accuracy, but when extended context is enriched with perturbed demonstrations, most models substantially recover. These findings highlight critical limitations in numerical fact-checking and suggest that robustness remains an open challenge for current language models.

TL;DR: ETC是一种无需训练的动态RAG方法，通过建模token级不确定性动态来确定最佳检索时机，利用熵序列的一阶和二阶差分检测不确定性趋势，实现更早更精确的检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态RAG方法基于token级置信度触发检索，可能导致错误传播后才进行干预。需要更早检测不确定性趋势来确定最佳检索时机。

Method: ETC利用熵序列的一阶和二阶差分来检测不确定性趋势，无需训练即可确定检索时机，是即插即用、模型无关的方法。

Result: 在6个QA基准测试和3种LLM骨干网络上，ETC始终优于强基线方法，同时减少检索频率，在领域特定场景中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 趋势感知的不确定性建模能够产生更有效的检索时机，ETC方法具有鲁棒的泛化能力，可轻松集成到现有解码流水线中。

Abstract: Dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows large language models (LLMs) to fetch external knowledge on demand, offering greater adaptability than static RAG. A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing. The method is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and readily integrable into existing decoding pipelines. Implementation code is included in the supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言检索增强生成中，当检索到的证据与用户查询和上下文示例语言不同时，模型经常会出现语言漂移，生成非预期语言的响应，这在推理密集型解码中尤为明显。

Method: 提出Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD)，一种轻量级、无需训练的解码策略，通过惩罚非目标语言标记来温和地引导生成朝向目标语言。

Result: 在三个多语言数据集和多种类型不同的语言上的实验表明，SCD持续改善了语言对齐和任务性能。

Conclusion: SCD为多语言RAG提供了一种有效且可推广的解决方案，能够有效缓解输出语言漂移问题。

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform knowledge-intensive tasks in multilingual settings by leveraging retrieved documents as external evidence. However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.
  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.

TL;DR: BERTScore在金融领域存在数值变化敏感性不足的问题，FinNuE数据集揭示了这一局限性，并推动了金融NLP中数值感知评估框架的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERTScore作为广泛采用的语义相似度评估指标，在金融领域存在关键局限：对数值变化敏感性低，而金融文本中数值精度直接影响语义（如区分2%收益与20%损失）。

Method: 构建FinNuE诊断数据集，通过受控数值扰动覆盖财报电话会议、监管文件、社交媒体和新闻文章等金融文本类型，用于评估BERTScore的性能。

Result: BERTScore无法区分语义关键的数值差异，经常为财务上截然不同的文本对分配高相似度分数，揭示了基于嵌入的指标在金融领域的根本局限性。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了基于嵌入的指标在金融领域的根本局限性，并推动了金融NLP中数值感知评估框架的发展需求。

Abstract: BERTScore has become a widely adopted metric for evaluating semantic similarity between natural language sentences. However, we identify a critical limitation: BERTScore exhibits low sensitivity to numerical variation, a significant weakness in finance where numerical precision directly affects meaning (e.g., distinguishing a 2% gain from a 20% loss). We introduce FinNuE, a diagnostic dataset constructed with controlled numerical perturbations across earnings calls, regulatory filings, social media, and news articles. Using FinNuE, demonstrate that BERTScore fails to distinguish semantically critical numerical differences, often assigning high similarity scores to financially divergent text pairs. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations of embedding-based metrics for finance and motivate numerically-aware evaluation frameworks for financial NLP.

Conclusion: PustakAI框架和NCERT-QA数据集为评估LLMs在教育系统中的应用提供了有效工具，揭示了当前模型在课程对齐方面的能力与不足。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like content. This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education. In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance. In this paper, we present the framework "PustakAI"\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset "NCERT-QA" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8. We classify the curated QA pairs as Factoid, Inferential, and Others (evaluative and reasoning). We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum. Along with the usability of the dataset, we analyze the strengths and limitations of current open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1b, Llama3.2:3b, and Nemotron-mini:4b) and high-end LLMs (Llama-4-Scout-17B and Deepseek-r1-70B) as AI-based learning tools in formal education systems.

Motivation: 标准自注意力的二次复杂度限制了Transformer模型在长上下文任务中的应用，而现有高效变体通常需要架构更改和昂贵的从头预训练。

Method: 将长输入分段为重叠块，使用参数无关的融合机制为每个块表示提供文档结构意识，通过累积前后块的上下文向量来丰富边界表示。

Result: 在长文档摘要任务中，该方法与最先进方法竞争且经常超越，无需架构修改或外部检索机制。

Conclusion: ScaleFormer提供了一种简单有效的方法，使预训练模型能够有效推理长文本，实现线性复杂度并保持文档叙事流。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of standard self-attention severely limits the application of Transformer-based models to long-context tasks. While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text. Experiments on long-document summarization show that our method is highly competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without requiring architectural modifications or external retrieval mechanisms.

Motivation: 语音象征性是语言学中语音形式与意义之间非任意关联的概念，本研究旨在探索多模态大语言模型如何解释人类语言中的听觉信息，特别是对语音象似性的处理能力。

Method: 使用LEX-ICON数据集（包含4种自然语言的8,052个单词和2,930个伪词），在文本（正字法和IPA）和听觉形式输入下，通过测量音素级注意力分数来观察模型在25个语义维度上的分层信息处理。

Conclusion: 这些结果连接了人工智能和认知语言学领域，为MLLMs的可解释性提供了首个大规模、定量的语音象似性分析。

Abstract: Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖大规模多轮对话数据集微调大语言模型，将每次响应生成视为孤立任务，未能明确将多轮指令跟随纳入优化目标，导致模型难以处理复杂的长距离约束。

Method: GraphIF包含三个关键组件：基于智能体的关系提取模块（通过动作触发机制捕获轮间语义关系构建结构化图）、关系图提示生成模块（将结构化图信息转换为自然语言提示）和响应重写模块（使用生成的图提示优化初始LLM输出）。

Result: 在两个长多轮对话数据集上的广泛实验表明，GraphIF可以无缝集成到指令调优的大语言模型中，并在所有四个多轮指令跟随评估指标上带来显著改进。

Conclusion: 图结构特别适合建模多轮指令跟随，GraphIF框架成功利用图提示增强了大语言模型的多轮指令跟随能力。

Abstract: Multi-turn instruction following is essential for building intelligent conversational systems that can consistently adhere to instructions across dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We present ADI-20, an extension of the previously published ADI-17 Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) dataset. ADI-20 covers all Arabic-speaking countries' dialects. It comprises 3,556 hours from 19 Arabic dialects in addition to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We used this dataset to train and evaluate various state-of-the-art ADI systems. We explored fine-tuning pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN-based models, as well as Whisper encoder blocks coupled with an attention pooling layer and a classification dense layer. We investigated the effect of (i) training data size and (ii) the model's number of parameters on identification performance. Our results show a small decrease in F1 score while using only 30% of the original training data. We open-source our collected data and trained models to enable the reproduction of our work, as well as support further research in ADI.

Abstract: With the growing number of submitted scientific papers, there is an increasing demand for systems that can assist reviewers in evaluating research claims. Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.

Motivation: 社交媒体已成为监测灾难事件的重要工具，但现有系统存在事件相关偏差问题，影响对新兴事件的泛化能力。

Method: 通过因果视角进行偏差缓解，提出减少事件和领域相关偏差的方法。

Result: 在三个灾难分类任务中，该方法比多个基线方法高出最多+1.9% F1分数，并显著提升了基于预训练语言模型的分类器性能。

Conclusion: 基于因果推理的偏差缓解方法能有效提高社交媒体灾难事件分类的泛化性能。

Abstract: Due to the rapid growth of social media platforms, these tools have become essential for monitoring information during ongoing disaster events. However, extracting valuable insights requires real-time processing of vast amounts of data. A major challenge in existing systems is their exposure to event-related biases, which negatively affects their ability to generalize to emerging events. While recent advancements in debiasing and causal learning offer promising solutions, they remain underexplored in the disaster event domain. In this work, we approach bias mitigation through a causal lens and propose a method to reduce event- and domain-related biases, enhancing generalization to future events. Our approach outperforms multiple baselines by up to +1.9% F1 and significantly improves a PLM-based classifier across three disaster classification tasks.

TL;DR: VISTA是一个基于Web的可视化交互系统，用于分析多轮推理任务中大型语言模型的推理过程，通过可视化上下文影响、交互式修改对话历史和自动生成推理依赖树来降低分析复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮交互场景更贴近真实世界问题解决，但分析其中的复杂推理过程面临挑战，包括上下文依赖复杂、缺乏专门可视化工具导致研究人员认知负荷高。

Method: 开发VISTA系统，提供上下文影响可视化、交互式对话历史修改进行"假设"分析、自动解析会话生成推理依赖树等功能。

Result: VISTA显著降低了分析推理链的复杂性，促进了对当前LLM能力和局限性的深入理解。

Conclusion: VISTA提供了一个统一交互框架来理解LLM在多轮推理中的表现，平台开源且支持自定义基准和本地模型的集成。

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn interactions, as these scenarios more closely mirror real-world problem-solving. However, analyzing the intricate reasoning processes within these interactions presents a significant challenge due to complex contextual dependencies and a lack of specialized visualization tools, leading to a high cognitive load for researchers. To address this gap, we present VISTA, an web-based Visual Interactive System for Textual Analytics in multi-turn reasoning tasks. VISTA allows users to visualize the influence of context on model decisions and interactively modify conversation histories to conduct "what-if" analyses across different models. Furthermore, the platform can automatically parse a session and generate a reasoning dependency tree, offering a transparent view of the model's step-by-step logical path. By providing a unified and interactive framework, VISTA significantly reduces the complexity of analyzing reasoning chains, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs. The platform is open-source and supports easy integration of custom benchmarks and local models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Text-to-SQL领域因数据稀缺、简单和低多样性而导致的性能瓶颈问题，建立可扩展的数据中心化基础。

Method: 提出六维数据增强框架，包含SQL执行验证、自然语言问题生成、思维链推理轨迹和数据分类，采用模块化数据库管理器确保跨数据库兼容性，并引入掩码对齐检索方法进行结构感知的示例匹配。

Result: 构建了89,544个高质量Text-to-SQL对的数据集SQLFlow；在相同数据预算下，开源LLM微调后性能持续提升；闭源LLM的检索策略优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 建立了可扩展的数据中心化基础，强调了高质量结构化数据在现代AI中的关键作用，为推进Text-to-SQL系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The data-centric paradigm has become pivotal in AI, especially for Text-to-SQL, where performance is limited by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets. To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries. Experiments show our retrieval strategy outperforms existing methods, underscoring the value of SQLFlow's high-fidelity data and our novel technique. Our work establishes a scalable, data-centric foundation for advancing Text-to-SQL systems and highlights the critical role of high-quality structured data in modern AI.

Motivation: 现有LLMs的Chain-of-Thought提示方法虽然推理能力强，但往往产生不必要的冗长解释，增加了成本并可能降低准确性。不同效率导向方法的公平比较受到碎片化评估实践的阻碍。

Method: 构建EffiReason-Bench基准，包含三个类别：推理蓝图、动态执行和后处理优化。通过标准化推理结构、全面选项分析和人工验证的流程，为CommonsenseQA和LogiQA构建经过验证的CoT标注。

Result: 在6个开源LLMs（1B-70B）和4个数据集上评估了7种方法。实验表明没有单一方法在所有情况下都最优，最佳策略取决于骨干模型规模、任务复杂度和架构。

Conclusion: 提出了E3-Score这一受经济权衡模型启发的原则性指标，提供平滑稳定的评估。高效推理方法的选择需要根据具体场景进行权衡，没有通用最优解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting achieve strong reasoning but often produce unnecessarily long explanations, increasing cost and sometimes reducing accuracy. Fair comparison of efficiency-oriented approaches is hindered by fragmented evaluation practices. We introduce EffiReason-Bench, a unified benchmark for rigorous cross-paradigm evaluation of efficient reasoning methods across three categories: Reasoning Blueprints, Dynamic Execution, and Post-hoc Refinement. To enable step-by-step evaluation, we construct verified CoT annotations for CommonsenseQA and LogiQA via a pipeline that enforces standardized reasoning structures, comprehensive option-wise analysis, and human verification. We evaluate 7 methods across 6 open-source LLMs (1B-70B) on 4 datasets spanning mathematics, commonsense, and logic, and propose the E3-Score, a principled metric inspired by economic trade-off modeling that provides smooth, stable evaluation without discontinuities or heavy reliance on heuristics. Experiments show that no single method universally dominates; optimal strategies depend on backbone scale, task complexity, and architecture.

TL;DR: 提出了PAL框架，通过两阶段训练和选择生成策略，直接以人设对齐为目标改进个性化对话生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流模型通过token级语言模型训练隐式实现个性化，容易忽视给定人设并生成通用回复

Method: 两阶段训练：人设感知学习和人设对齐，配备选择生成推理策略，在语义层面提升人设敏感度

Result: 实验表明该框架优于许多最先进的个性化对话方法和大型语言模型

Conclusion: PAL框架通过直接以人设对齐为训练目标，能够生成更相关的人设对话回复

Abstract: Personalized dialogue generation aims to leverage persona profiles and dialogue history to generate persona-relevant and consistent responses. Mainstream models typically rely on token-level language model training with persona dialogue data, such as Next Token Prediction, to implicitly achieve personalization, making these methods tend to neglect the given personas and generate generic responses. To address this issue, we propose a novel Persona-Aware Alignment Framework (PAL), which directly treats persona alignment as the training objective of dialogue generation. Specifically, PAL employs a two-stage training method including Persona-aware Learning and Persona Alignment, equipped with an easy-to-use inference strategy Select then Generate, to improve persona sensitivity and generate more persona-relevant responses at the semantics level. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms many state-of-the-art personalized dialogue methods and large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言训练数据选择方法通常忽略数据的内在语言结构，导致模型的多语言能力对训练数据组成高度敏感

Method: 两阶段预选择框架：首先基于语言可分性分数过滤训练数据，然后使用现有选择方法精炼子集

Result: 在6个基准测试和22种语言上的实验表明，LangGPS能提升现有选择方法的有效性和泛化能力，尤其对理解任务和低资源语言效果显著

Conclusion: 语言可分性可作为多语言数据效用的新视角，支持开发更具语言意识的LLMs，并可用于多语言课程学习

Abstract: Joint multilingual instruction tuning is a widely adopted approach to improve the multilingual instruction-following ability and downstream performance of large language models (LLMs), but the resulting multilingual capability remains highly sensitive to the composition and selection of the training data. Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains. Together, we hope our work offers a new perspective on data utility in multilingual contexts and support the development of more linguistically informed LLMs.

Motivation: 当前端到端语音模型存在显著响应延迟，主要源于语音令牌的自回归生成和复杂流匹配模型的使用。

Method: 集成多码本分词器和多令牌预测策略，直接生成多码本语音令牌，无需延迟诱导的流匹配模型。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发实时交互应用的高效高性能语音语言模型提供了有价值的见解，并比较了单码本和多码本策略。

Abstract: Current end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have made notable progress, yet they still encounter considerable response latency. This delay primarily arises from the autoregressive generation of speech tokens and the reliance on complex flow-matching models for speech synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce VocalNet-M2, a novel low-latency SLM that integrates a multi-codebook tokenizer and a multi-token prediction (MTP) strategy. Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model. Furthermore, our MTP strategy enhances generation efficiency and improves overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注单轮交互和对话特征，忽略了多轮通信的复杂性以及指令遵循和安全性等关键能力，且全双工模型在多轮设置中的评估面临对话边界模糊和上下文不一致等挑战。

Method: 通过将连续的全双工对话分割为离散的轮次，开发了MTR-DuplexBench基准测试，支持在对话质量、对话动态、指令遵循和安全性四个维度上进行逐轮综合评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前全双工语音语言模型在维持多轮对话和跨评估维度的一致性表现方面存在困难，验证了所提基准测试的必要性和有效性。

Conclusion: MTR-DuplexBench基准测试填补了全双工语音语言模型多轮评估的空白，为模型开发提供了更全面的评估框架，有助于提升模型的整体性能。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) enable real-time, overlapping conversational interactions, offering a more dynamic user experience compared to traditional half-duplex models. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions and conversational features, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication and critical capabilities such as instruction following and safety. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark. The benchmark and code will be available in the future.

Conclusion: 证明了在企业AI部署中，隐私和性能可以兼得，让银行、医院、律师事务所等机构能够采用对话式文档AI而无需将专有信息传输给外部提供商。

Abstract: Organizations handling sensitive documents face a critical dilemma: adopt cloud-based AI systems that offer powerful question-answering capabilities but compromise data privacy, or maintain local processing that ensures security but delivers poor accuracy. We present a question-answering system that resolves this trade-off by combining semantic understanding with keyword precision, operating entirely on local infrastructure without internet access. Our approach demonstrates that organizations can achieve competitive accuracy on complex queries across legal, scientific, and conversational documents while keeping all data on their machines. By balancing two complementary retrieval strategies and using consumer-grade hardware acceleration, the system delivers reliable answers with minimal errors, letting banks, hospitals, and law firms adopt conversational document AI without transmitting proprietary information to external providers. This work establishes that privacy and performance need not be mutually exclusive in enterprise AI deployment.

Conclusion: 通过识别并纠正LLMs的不平衡评估偏好，本文提出的方法显著提升了多步数学推理中的批判能力，为解决LLMs批判性能差的问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: To improve Multi-step Mathematical Reasoning (MsMR) of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to obtain scalable supervision from the corpus by automatically critiquing mistakes in the reasoning process of MsMR and rendering a final verdict of the problem-solution. Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct. Extensive experimental results on our built OPS and existing available critic benchmarks demonstrate the validity of our method.

Abstract: In the context of pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs), synthetic data has emerged as an alternative for generating high-quality pretraining data at scale. This is particularly beneficial in low-resource language settings where the benefits of recent LLMs have been unevenly distributed across languages. In this work, we present a systematic study on the generation and evaluation of synthetic multilingual pretraining data for Indic languages, where we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset BhashaKritika, comprising 540B tokens using 5 different techniques for 10 languages. We explore the impact of grounding generation in documents, personas, and topics. We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages. To support scalable and language-sensitive evaluation, we introduce a modular quality evaluation pipeline that integrates script and language detection, metadata consistency checks, n-gram repetition analysis, and perplexity-based filtering using KenLM models. Our framework enables robust quality control across diverse scripts and linguistic contexts. Empirical results through model runs reveal key trade-offs in generation strategies and highlight best practices for constructing effective multilingual corpora.

Motivation: 文化遗产文本包含丰富知识，但由于将非结构化话语转换为结构化知识图谱的挑战，难以系统查询。

Method: 五步方法：基础分析、注释模式开发、管道架构、集成优化和全面评估，使用三个LLM（Claude Sonnet 3.7、Llama 3.3 70B、GPT-4o-mini）的顺序管道。

Result: 成功提取复杂文化遗产知识：元数据提取F1 0.96-0.99，实体识别F1 0.7-0.8，假设提取F1 0.65-0.75，证据提取F1 0.95-0.97，话语表示G-EVAL 0.62。较小模型表现竞争力强，可实现成本效益部署。

Conclusion: ATR4CH是首个协调基于LLM的提取与文化遗产本体论的系统方法，提供了可复制的框架，支持文化遗产机构将文本知识系统转换为可查询的知识图谱。

Abstract: Cultural Heritage texts contain rich knowledge that is difficult to query systematically due to the challenges of converting unstructured discourse into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing. Practical Implications - ATR4CH enables Cultural Heritage institutions to systematically convert textual knowledge into queryable KGs, supporting automated metadata enrichment and knowledge discovery.

Result: 大量实验表明，TruthfulRAG优于现有方法，有效缓解知识冲突，提高了RAG系统的鲁棒性和可信度。

Conclusion: TruthfulRAG是首个利用知识图谱解决RAG系统中事实层面知识冲突的框架，能够使LLM生成更忠实和准确的响应。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval-based methods with generative models. As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.

### [44] [Position: On the Methodological Pitfalls of Evaluating Base LLMs for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10381)
*Jason Chan,Zhixue Zhao,Robert Gaizauskas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文认为评估基础LLM的推理能力存在方法论问题，因为基础LLM的预训练目标与推理评估的规范性标准不匹配，其输出只是语言统计模式的副产品，不能视为真正的推理尝试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究评估基础LLM的推理能力来揭示其局限性和偏见，但作者认为这种方法存在根本性问题，需要重新审视。

Method: 通过分析基础LLM预训练目标与推理评估标准之间的不匹配，论证其输出只是语言统计模式的副产品而非真正的推理。

Result: 发现基础LLM生成逻辑有效或无效结论只是语言统计模式符合度的偶然副产品，不能作为其真实推理能力的体现。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新审视依赖这些假设的现有研究，未来工作应考虑这些方法论陷阱，并指出基础LLM的推理结论不能推广到经过指令调优的后训练LLM。

Abstract: Existing work investigates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to uncover their limitations, human-like biases and underlying processes. Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following. We call for a critical re-examination of existing work that relies implicitly on these assumptions, and for future work to account for these methodological pitfalls.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELICATE是一种用于历史意大利语实体链接的神经符号方法，结合BERT编码器和Wikidata上下文信息，通过时间合理性和实体类型一致性选择知识库实体。ENEIDE是一个历史意大利语多领域实体链接语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人文学科中实体链接的挑战，包括复杂文档类型、缺乏领域特定数据集和模型、以及长尾实体问题。

Method: 提出DELICATE神经符号方法，结合BERT编码器和Wikidata上下文信息，利用时间合理性和实体类型一致性进行实体选择。同时构建ENEIDE多领域语料库。

Result: DELICATE在历史意大利语实体链接任务中优于其他模型，即使与具有数十亿参数的大型架构相比。其置信度得分和特征敏感性提供了比纯神经方法更可解释的结果。

Conclusion: DELICATE方法在历史意大利语实体链接任务中表现出色，提供了更好的可解释性，ENEIDE语料库为领域研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: In spite of the remarkable advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing, the task of Entity Linking (EL) remains challenging in the field of humanities due to complex document typologies, lack of domain-specific datasets and models, and long-tail entities, i.e., entities under-represented in Knowledge Bases (KBs). The goal of this paper is to address these issues with two main contributions. The first contribution is DELICATE, a novel neuro-symbolic method for EL on historical Italian which combines a BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata to select appropriate KB entities using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. The second contribution is ENEIDE, a multi-domain EL corpus in historical Italian semi-automatically extracted from two annotated editions spanning from the 19th to the 20th century and including literary and political texts. Results show how DELICATE outperforms other EL models in historical Italian even if compared with larger architectures with billions of parameters. Moreover, further analyses reveal how DELICATE confidence scores and features sensitivity provide results which are more explainable and interpretable than purely neural methods.

TL;DR: 轻量级模型通过类比范式组织，仅用100个结构化示例就能在英语使役/起始交替任务上达到F1=0.95，超越GPT-3的零样本性能，证明类比方法能大幅减少数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否通过类比范式组织，能让轻量级模型在极少数据下达到与大型语言模型相当的性能。

Method: 采用计算化方法实现三个认知启发原则：类比结构、对比学习和最小上下文线索，在结构化补全任务中测试模型从类比模式识别正确句子补全的能力。

Result: 仅用100个结构化示例训练轻量级模型（BERT+CNN，50万参数），在英语使役/起始交替任务上达到F1=0.95，优于GPT-3零样本（F1=0.87）。消融研究证实类比组织和对比结构提升性能。

Conclusion: 类比范式组织能够以比传统方法少几个数量级的数据实现有竞争力的语言规则学习。

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong performance through training on vast datasets. Can analogical paradigm organization enable lightweight models to match this performance with minimal data? We develop a computational approach implementing three cognitive-inspired principles: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues. We test this approach with structured completion tasks where models identify correct sentence completions from analogical patterns with contrastive alternatives. Training lightweight models (BERT+CNN, $0.5M$ parameters) on only one hundred structured examples of English causative/inchoative alternations achieves $F1=0.95$, outperforming zero-shot \texttt{GPT-o3} ($F1=0.87$). Ablation studies confirm that analogical organization and contrastive structure improve performance, consistently surpassing randomly shuffled baselines across architectures. Cross-phenomenon validation using unspecified object alternations replicates these efficiency gains, confirming approach robustness. Our results show that analogical paradigm organization enables competitive linguistic rule learning with orders of magnitude less data than conventional approaches require.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对模糊请求生成多个解释-答案对的方法，通过强化学习和定制奖励函数训练模型，在单次生成中覆盖更多有效答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理模糊请求时往往隐含地承诺单一解释，这种意图误解会使用户感到沮丧并带来安全风险。

Method: 使用强化学习和定制奖励函数训练模型，以多个有效答案作为监督信号，在单个结构化响应中生成多个解释-答案对。

Result: 在对话问答和语义解析任务上的实验表明，该方法比基线方法实现了更高的有效答案覆盖率。人工评估确认预测的解释与其答案高度一致。

Conclusion: 该方法通过明确解释提高透明度，通过单次生成步骤实现效率，并通过结构化输出格式支持下游应用。

Abstract: Large language models often respond to ambiguous requests by implicitly committing to one interpretation. Intent misunderstandings can frustrate users and create safety risks. To address this, we propose generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single structured response to ambiguous requests. Our models are trained with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision. Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches. Human evaluation confirms that predicted interpretations are highly aligned with their answers. Our approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and supports downstream applications through its structured output format.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在状态跟踪任务中的能力，该任务需要模型跟踪多个实体的状态变化，以隔离状态跟踪组件与其他因素。

Method: 基于三个明确定义的状态跟踪任务构建基准测试，分析LLMs在不同场景下的表现，包括使用思维链机制的情况。

Result: 新一代LLMs（GPT-4、Llama3）能够有效跟踪状态，特别是在结合思维链机制时；而旧代模型虽然理解任务并在初始阶段能解决，但在一定步骤后经常失败。

Conclusion: 新一代LLMs在状态跟踪任务中表现出色，思维链机制能显著提升性能，但模型能力存在代际差异，旧代模型在复杂状态跟踪中存在局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex tasks, including those requiring a certain level of reasoning. In this paper, we focus on state tracking, a problem where models need to keep track of the state governing a number of entities. To isolate the state tracking component from other factors, we propose a benchmark based on three well-defined state tracking tasks and analyse the performance of LLMs in different scenarios. The results indicate that the recent generation of LLMs (specifically, GPT-4 and Llama3) are capable of tracking state, especially when integrated with mechanisms such as Chain of Thought. However, models from the former generation, while understanding the task and being able to solve it at the initial stages, often fail at this task after a certain number of steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LocalBench是首个专门评估LLMs在美国县级本地知识能力的基准，包含14,782个验证问答对，涵盖526个县。评估显示现有模型在本地知识方面存在严重不足，最佳模型在叙事类问题准确率仅56.8%，数值推理低于15.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs评估主要关注宏观地理任务，但缺乏对超本地知识的系统评估。随着AI在公民平台、社区新闻等应用需求增长，需要能够理解社区特定动态、文化叙事和本地治理的AI系统。

Method: 基于Localness概念框架构建LocalBench基准，整合人口普查数据、本地subreddit讨论和区域新闻等多样化来源，涵盖物理、认知和关系三个本地维度。评估了13个最先进LLMs在闭卷和网络增强设置下的表现。

Result: 模型表现显著不足：最佳模型在叙事类问题准确率56.8%，数值推理低于15.5%。更大模型规模和网络增强不能保证更好性能，搜索使Gemini准确率提升13.6%，但降低GPT系列11.4%。

Conclusion: 结果强调了开发能够支持公平、位置感知AI系统的语言模型的紧迫需求，这些系统需要能够参与不同地理和文化背景下本地社区的多样化、细粒度现实。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on macro-scale geographic tasks, such as global factual recall, event summarization, and regional reasoning. Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.

TL;DR: KPPO是一个基于知识供给的提示优化框架，通过系统知识集成而非潜在激发来解决知识密集型任务中的局限性，在15个基准测试中平均性能提升约6%，同时减少29%的token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注激发模型能力，但在知识密集型任务中存在根本限制，无法提供所需的事实知识、术语精度和推理模式。

Method: 提出KPPO框架，包含三个关键创新：知识差距填补机制、批量候选评估方法和自适应知识修剪策略。

Result: 在15个知识密集型基准测试中，KPPO比最强的基于激发的方法平均性能提升约6%，同时实现相当或更低的token消耗。

Conclusion: KPPO通过将提示优化重新定义为系统知识集成，有效解决了知识密集型任务中的挑战，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: While prompt optimization has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing language model performance, existing approaches primarily focus on elicitation-based strategies that search for optimal prompts to activate models' capabilities. These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

Result: RIFL显著提升指令遵循能力，在AdvancedIF上获得6.7%绝对提升，在公开基准上表现优异

Conclusion: 评分标准是训练和评估大语言模型高级指令遵循能力的有效工具，为开发更可靠AI系统铺平道路

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive performance on a range of tasks, yet advanced instruction following (IF)-especially for complex, multi-turn, and system-prompted instructions-remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了语言风格（如恐惧、好奇等）如何重构有害意图，从而引发对齐模型的不安全响应。通过构建风格增强的越狱基准，发现风格重构可将越狱成功率提升高达57个百分点，并提出了风格中和预处理方法来缓解此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主要评估对语义等价越狱提示的鲁棒性，但忽视了语言风格变化作为攻击面的潜在风险。本文旨在系统研究不同语言风格如何重构有害意图并引发模型的不安全响应。

Method: 构建风格增强的越狱基准，将3个标准数据集的提示转换为11种不同语言风格，使用手工模板和LLM重写来保持语义意图。评估16个开源和闭源指令调优模型，并引入风格中和预处理步骤来消除操纵性风格线索。

Result: 风格重构显著提高了越狱成功率，最高提升57个百分点。恐惧、好奇和同情等风格最为有效，情境化重写优于模板化变体。风格中和预处理显著降低了越狱成功率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前安全流程中被忽视的系统性和规模化抵抗漏洞，语言风格重构是LLM安全评估中需要重视的新攻击面。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated for robustness against paraphrased or semantically equivalent jailbreak prompts, yet little attention has been paid to linguistic variation as an attack surface. In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.
  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates. Our findings reveal a systemic and scaling-resistant vulnerability overlooked in current safety pipelines.

Motivation: 现有基准在统计能力、数据生成一致性和评估灵活性方面存在根本性挑战，限制了当前记忆评估框架的发展。需要专门研究对话记忆的小语料优势，而不是简单应用通用RAG解决方案。

Method: 构建了全面的对话记忆评估基准，包含6个主要类别：用户事实、助手回忆、弃权、偏好、时间变化和隐式连接。比较了全上下文方法与RAG记忆系统的性能。

Result: 简单全上下文方法在150次对话内达到70-82%准确率，而Mem0等RAG记忆系统只有30-45%。确定了实用过渡点：前30次对话长上下文表现最佳，150次对话内仍可行，超过150次需要混合或RAG方法。

Conclusion: 对话记忆具有小语料优势，其中穷举搜索和完全重排序是可行的，这值得专门研究关注，而不是简单将通用RAG解决方案应用于对话历史。

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for conversational memory evaluation containing 75,336 question-answer pairs across diverse categories including user facts, assistant recall, abstention, preferences, temporal changes, and implicit connections. While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.

Motivation: 探索文学体裁作为形式分类而非制度分类的有效性，分析作者性别如何影响文学分类标准。

Method: 使用CONLIT数据集构建文学小说和体裁小说语料库，采用Welch's ANOVA比较叙事特征分布，使用逻辑回归建模文学分类效果，分析风格和语义向量表示。

Result: 发现每个文学类别具有统计显著的形式标记，女性作者身份会缩小并模糊获得文学地位的标准。

Conclusion: 文学体裁确实存在形式上的显著差异，但作者性别在文学分类中起到重要调节作用，女性作者面临更严格的评判标准。

Abstract: Though the concept of genre has been a subject of discussion for millennia, the relatively recent emergence of genre fiction has added a new layer to this ongoing conversation. While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在长文档理解上面临两个挑战：大量无关内容的信息干扰，以及Transformer架构的二次计算成本。现有方法要么牺牲细节，要么增加系统复杂性。

Method: 提出URaG框架，引入轻量级跨模态检索模块，将早期Transformer层转换为高效证据选择器，识别并保留最相关页面，让深层层专注于相关信息。

Result: 广泛实验表明URaG实现了最先进的性能，同时将计算开销减少了44-56%。

Conclusion: URaG证明了MLLMs固有的证据定位能力可以在推理过程中显式利用，实现高效的长文档理解，统一检索与生成于单一模型中。

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with long document understanding due to two fundamental challenges: information interference from abundant irrelevant content, and the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based architectures. Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%. The code is available at https://github.com/shi-yx/URaG.

Conclusion: 研究表明，当精心整合时，升级到更先进的语言模型可以显著提升文本情感分析的性能，特别是DeBERTa的复杂注意力系统有助于处理复杂句子结构。

Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis faces ongoing challenges in Aspect Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE), particularly in accurately capturing the relationships between aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities. While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text. The implementation of our approach is publicly available at: https://github.com/VishalRepos/DESS.

TL;DR: 本文研究了MedGemma模型在医疗订单提取任务中的表现，比较了三种提示范式，发现简单的一样本提示方法在验证集上表现最佳，而复杂推理框架可能导致过度思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确从医患对话中提取医疗订单对于减轻临床文档负担和确保患者安全至关重要。本文旨在评估领域特定开源语言模型MedGemma在结构化订单提取中的性能。

Method: 系统评估了三种不同的提示范式：简单的一样本方法、推理导向的ReAct框架和多步骤代理工作流。

Result: 实验表明，虽然ReAct和代理流程等复杂框架功能强大，但简单的一样本提示方法在官方验证集上取得了最高性能。

Conclusion: 在手动标注的转录本上，复杂推理链可能导致"过度思考"并引入噪声，使直接方法更加稳健高效。这项工作为在不同数据条件下选择适当的临床信息提取提示策略提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: The accurate extraction of medical orders from doctor-patient conversations is a critical task for reducing clinical documentation burdens and ensuring patient safety. This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.

TL;DR: 该研究针对MEDIQA-WV 2025共享任务，提出了两种互补方法来生成伤口护理查询的文本回复：基于检索的提示挖掘和基于元数据预测的生成策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步远程医疗的快速发展增加了医生工作负担，需要AI系统帮助更有效地处理患者查询，特别是结合图像的伤口护理问题。

Method: 1. 提示挖掘策略：嵌入训练数据并检索最相似的示例作为少样本演示；2. 元数据引导生成：识别关键元数据属性，训练分类器预测这些属性并动态调整生成过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，提示挖掘提高了回复的相关性，元数据引导生成进一步提升了临床精确度。

Conclusion: 这两种方法为开发能够提供可靠高效伤口护理支持的AI工具指明了有前景的方向。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of asynchronous remote care has intensified provider workload, creating demand for AI systems that can assist clinicians in managing patient queries more efficiently. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了编码器增强的因果解码器模型架构，相比因果变换器具有更好的训练效率和压缩性能，并展示了如何基于熵估计来优化模型训练以提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于因果语言模型的语言压缩算法虽然高效，但用于准确估计语言熵在计算上不可行。需要找到更高效的方法来估计语言熵并利用熵信息来提升模型性能。

Method: 引入编码器增强的因果解码器模型架构，通过估计每个token的熵值，训练模型接近但不超出估计的每token熵值。

Result: 该方法在有限硬件条件下实现了比因果变换器更高的压缩率，且接近熵估计的模型比单纯最小化损失的模型具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 考虑语言熵约束的训练策略能够有效提升语言模型的泛化性能，编码器增强架构在训练效率和压缩性能方面优于传统因果变换器。

Abstract: Language prediction is constrained by informational entropy intrinsic to language, such that there exists a limit to how accurate any language model can become and equivalently a lower bound to language compression. The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.

TL;DR: SSR是一个新颖的LLM推理框架，通过将模型响应分解为可验证的(子问题，子答案)对，实现步骤级置信度估计和精确细化，在多个推理基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时框架依赖粗略的自验证和自校正，限制了在复杂任务上的有效性，需要更细粒度的评估和精确细化方法。

Method: 将模型响应分解为可验证的(子问题，子答案)对，通过受控重解和自一致性检查进行步骤级置信度估计，定位不可靠步骤并迭代细化。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试和三个LLM上的实证结果显示，SSR持续优于最先进的迭代自细化基线方法。

Conclusion: SSR不仅提供性能提升，还为评估和理解LLM内部推理过程提供了原则性的黑盒方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet existing test-time frameworks often rely on coarse self-verification and self-correction, limiting their effectiveness on complex tasks. In this paper, we propose Socratic Self-Refine (SSR), a novel framework for fine-grained evaluation and precise refinement of LLM reasoning. Our proposed SSR decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains. Empirical results across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs show that SSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines. Beyond performance gains, SSR provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/socratic-self-refine-reasoning.

Conclusion: Instella为社区提供了透明、高性能且多功能的替代方案，推动了开放和可复现的语言建模研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet the majority of high-performing models remain closed-source or partially open, limiting transparency and reproducibility. In this work, we introduce Instella, a family of fully open three billion parameter language models trained entirely on openly available data and codebase. Powered by AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs, Instella is developed through large-scale pre-training, general-purpose instruction tuning, and alignment with human preferences. Despite using substantially fewer pre-training tokens than many contemporaries, Instella achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open models and is competitive with leading open-weight models of comparable size. We further release two specialized variants: Instella-Long, capable of handling context lengths up to 128K tokens, and Instella-Math, a reasoning-focused model enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on mathematical tasks. Together, these contributions establish Instella as a transparent, performant, and versatile alternative for the community, advancing the goal of open and reproducible language modeling research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒蒸馏问题，即仅从专有教师模型的文本输出学习，无法访问其内部logits或参数，需要更有效的蒸馏方法。

Method: 将学生LLM作为生成器，训练判别器区分师生模型响应，形成极小极大博弈，判别器作为在线奖励模型与学生共同进化，提供稳定自适应反馈。

Result: GAD持续超越常用的序列级知识蒸馏方法，Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct学生模型在LMSYS-Chat自动评估中与GPT-5-Chat教师模型表现相当。

Conclusion: GAD是黑盒LLM蒸馏的一个有前景且有效的范式。

Abstract: Black-box distillation creates student large language models (LLMs) by learning from a proprietary teacher model's text outputs alone, without access to its internal logits or parameters. In this work, we introduce Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy and black-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game. The discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model that co-evolves with the student, providing stable, adaptive feedback. Experimental results show that GAD consistently surpasses the commonly used sequence-level knowledge distillation. In particular, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (student) trained with GAD becomes comparable to its teacher, GPT-5-Chat, on the LMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation. The results establish GAD as a promising and effective paradigm for black-box LLM distillation.

*Yesheng Liang,Haisheng Chen,Song Han,Zhijian Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParoQuant是一种仅权重的后训练量化方法，通过成对旋转量化和通道级缩放来抑制异常值，减少量化误差，在推理任务上比AWQ平均提升2.4%准确率，且开销小于10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)权重和激活中的异常值会导致较大的量化误差和严重的精度下降，特别是在推理任务中误差会在长思维链中积累。现有PTQ方法要么无法充分抑制异常值，要么在推理时引入显著开销。

Method: 提出成对旋转量化(ParoQuant)，结合硬件高效的独立Givens旋转和通道级缩放，均衡通道间幅度并缩小每个量化组内的动态范围。同时协同设计推理内核以充分利用GPU并行性，保持旋转和缩放操作的轻量级。

Result: 在推理任务上比AWQ平均提升2.4%准确率，且开销小于10%。

Conclusion: ParoQuant为推理LLM的更高效和准确部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) into low-precision representations to reduce memory footprint and accelerate inference. However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead. This paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs.

Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在多智能体系统中的广泛应用，其可靠性影响尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究用LLM智能体替代传统智能体是否能有效提升多智能体系统的可靠性。

Method: 从拜占庭容错角度研究LLM智能体的可靠性，设计了基于置信度探测的加权拜占庭容错共识机制CP-WBFT，利用LLM的内在反思和判别能力，通过探测加权的信息流传输方法来提升可靠性。

Conclusion: LLM智能体具有更强的怀疑能力，CP-WBFT机制能有效利用这一特性提升多智能体系统的可靠性，在极端故障条件下仍能保持稳定性能。

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of agent architectures and effectively identifying problematic agents when failures occur are crucial challenges in multi-agent systems (MAS). Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\% fault rate). Notably, our approach surpasses traditional methods by attaining remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in both mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.

TL;DR: Music Flamingo是一个专为音乐理解设计的大规模音频-语言模型，通过多阶段数据标注、增强的模型架构和后训练强化学习，在音乐理解和推理任务上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频-语言模型在音乐理解方面面临挑战，因为音乐具有动态、分层和信息密集的特性。现有模型受限于高质量音乐数据和标注的稀缺性，只能生成简短描述、回答浅层问题，且在不同音乐文化间的泛化能力有限。

Method: 1) 构建MF-Skills大规模数据集，包含丰富的描述和问答对；2) 在增强的Audio Flamingo 3骨干网络上进行微调；3) 引入后训练方法：先在MF-Think链式思维数据集上冷启动，然后基于GRPO的强化学习配合定制奖励。

Result: Music Flamingo在10多个音乐理解和推理基准测试中取得了最先进的成果，展现了作为通用音乐智能音频-语言模型的强大能力。

Conclusion: 该模型为音乐理解设定了新标准，展示了模型如何从表层识别转向分层、类人的音乐感知，为构建能与音乐进行有意义交互的下一代模型提供了基准和基础。

Abstract: We introduce Music Flamingo, a novel large audio-language model designed to advance music (including song) understanding in foundational audio models. While audio-language research has progressed rapidly, music remains challenging due to its dynamic, layered, and information-dense nature. Progress has been further limited by the difficulty of scaling open audio understanding models, primarily because of the scarcity of high-quality music data and annotations. As a result, prior models are restricted to producing short, high-level captions, answering only surface-level questions, and showing limited generalization across diverse musical cultures. To address these challenges, we curate MF-Skills, a large-scale dataset labeled through a multi-stage pipeline that yields rich captions and question-answer pairs covering harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context. We fine-tune an enhanced Audio Flamingo 3 backbone on MF-Skills and further strengthen multiple skills relevant to music understanding. To improve the model's reasoning abilities, we introduce a post-training recipe: we first cold-start with MF-Think, a novel chain-of-thought dataset grounded in music theory, followed by GRPO-based reinforcement learning with custom rewards. Music Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art results across 10+ benchmarks for music understanding and reasoning, establishing itself as a generalist and musically intelligent audio-language model. Beyond strong empirical results, Music Flamingo sets a new standard for advanced music understanding by demonstrating how models can move from surface-level recognition toward layered, human-like perception of songs. We believe this work provides both a benchmark and a foundation for the community to build the next generation of models that engage with music as meaningfully as humans do.

Abstract: Automated medical image captioning translates complex radiological images into diagnostic narratives that can support reporting workflows. We present a Swin-BART encoder-decoder system with a lightweight regional attention module that amplifies diagnostically salient regions before cross-attention. Trained and evaluated on ROCO, our model achieves state-of-the-art semantic fidelity while remaining compact and interpretable. We report results as mean$\pm$std over three seeds and include $95\%$ confidence intervals. Compared with baselines, our approach improves ROUGE (proposed 0.603, ResNet-CNN 0.356, BLIP2-OPT 0.255) and BERTScore (proposed 0.807, BLIP2-OPT 0.645, ResNet-CNN 0.623), with competitive BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR. We further provide ablations (regional attention on/off and token-count sweep), per-modality analysis (CT/MRI/X-ray), paired significance tests, and qualitative heatmaps that visualize the regions driving each description. Decoding uses beam search (beam size $=4$), length penalty $=1.1$, $no\_repeat\_ngram\_size$ $=3$, and max length $=128$. The proposed design yields accurate, clinically phrased captions and transparent regional attributions, supporting safe research use with a human in the loop.

Motivation: 序列微调方法在类增量学习中存在分布漂移问题，导致先前学习类别与新模型分布不匹配，影响分类器性能。

Method: 引入线性SLDC和弱非线性SLDC变体，学习特征映射算子来对齐微调前后的特征分布，并结合知识蒸馏减少表示漂移。

Result: 在标准CIL基准测试中，SLDC显著提升了SeqFT性能，结合KD后达到与联合训练相当的效果。

Conclusion: SLDC有效解决了序列微调中的分布漂移问题，为类增量学习提供了有效的分布对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that sequential fine-tuning (SeqFT) of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs), followed by classifier refinement using approximate distributions of class features, can be an effective strategy for class-incremental learning (CIL). However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at understanding and generating video descriptions but their high memory, computation, and deployment demands hinder practical use particularly for blind and low-vision (BLV) users who depend on detailed, context-aware descriptions. To study the effect of model size on accessibility-focused description quality, we evaluate SmolVLM2 variants with 500M and 2.2B parameters across two diverse datasets: AVCaps (outdoor), and Charades (indoor). In this work, we introduce two novel evaluation frameworks specifically designed for BLV accessibility assessment: the Multi-Context BLV Framework evaluating spatial orientation, social interaction, action events, and ambience contexts; and the Navigational Assistance Framework focusing on mobility-critical information. Additionally, we conduct a systematic evaluation of four different prompt design strategies and deploy both models on a smartphone, evaluating FP32 and INT8 precision variants to assess real-world performance constraints on resource-limited mobile devices.

Method: MuSeR方法包含三个关键方面：1）属性条件查询生成器模拟多样化用户情境；2）LLM自我评估和精炼响应；3）使用精炼后的数据进行监督微调。

Result: 在HealthBench数据集上显著提升LLM性能，特别是在上下文感知维度。通过知识蒸馏，较小的Qwen3-32B模型超越了教师模型，在HealthBench上达到63.8%的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MuSeR方法有效增强了LLM在医疗领域的上下文感知能力，为开发更安全、更有帮助的医疗AI助手提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%).

Result: 在三个知名数据集上的实验表明，ProgRAG在多跳KGQA任务中优于现有基线方法，提供了更高的可靠性和推理质量。

Conclusion: ProgRAG通过渐进式推理路径扩展和不确定性感知剪枝，有效解决了KG增强LLM中的检索和推理问题，显著提升了多跳知识图谱问答的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.

Abstract: Fake news detection methods based on writing style have achieved remarkable progress. However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于有向二分图编码器的自动ICD编码方法，通过建模常见代码和罕见代码之间的细粒度共现关系，利用LLM生成代码描述来增强表示，在长尾分布下显著提升了Macro-F1性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动ICD编码面临大规模标签空间（10,000-20,000个代码）和长尾分布问题，许多罕见代码缺乏足够的训练数据，需要有效利用代码间的共现关系来提升罕见代码的分类性能。

Method: 构建有向二分图编码器，将代码分为常见和罕见两类节点，边仅从常见代码指向罕见代码。基于条件概率定义共现偏置，注入注意力模块进行共现编码。使用LLM生成代码描述来增强初始嵌入。

Result: 在三个自动ICD编码基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，特别是在长尾分类的关键指标Macro-F1上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过建模代码间的细粒度共现关系并利用LLM增强代码表示，能够有效解决ICD编码中的长尾分布问题，显著提升罕见代码的分类性能。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding aims to assign multiple disease codes to clinical documents, constituting a crucial multi-label text classification task in healthcare informatics. However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system. Experiments on three automated ICD coding benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, which is the key metric for long-tail classification.

Conclusion: OutSafe-Bench填补了多模态内容安全评估的空白，揭示了当前MLLM的安全脆弱性，强调了开发更强大安全措施的必要性。

Abstract: Since Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly being integrated into everyday tools and intelligent agents, growing concerns have arisen regarding their possible output of unsafe contents, ranging from toxic language and biased imagery to privacy violations and harmful misinformation. Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.

Method: 提出AgentEvolver系统，包含三种协同机制：自我提问（好奇心驱动的任务生成）、自我导航（经验重用和混合策略指导改进探索效率）、自我归因（基于贡献度分配差异化奖励）。

Conclusion: AgentEvolver通过整合三种自进化机制，实现了智能体能力的可扩展、成本效益高且持续改进的进化。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance human productivity by reasoning, using tools, and executing complex tasks in diverse environments. However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

TL;DR: LayerNorm在Pre-LayerNorm和Post-LayerNorm transformers中对学习和记忆的影响不同：在Pre-LayerNorm中稳定学习，在Post-LayerNorm中影响记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LayerNorm在Pre-LayerNorm和Post-LayerNorm transformers中如何影响记忆和学习，因为尽管Pre-LayerNorm因稳定梯度流而更受欢迎，但LayerNorm对学习和记忆的具体影响尚不清楚。

Method: 通过分析13个模型在6个视觉和语言数据集上的表现，研究LayerNorm参数对Pre-和Post-LayerNorm transformers的影响，特别关注早期层LayerNorm的重要性。

Result: 在Pre-LayerNorm模型中，移除LayerNorm参数会加剧记忆并破坏学习稳定性；在Post-LayerNorm模型中，移除LayerNorm参数能有效减轻记忆问题并恢复真实标签。早期层LayerNorm最为关键。

Conclusion: LayerNorm在transformer中塑造记忆和学习方面扮演着关键但不同的角色，这为理解transformer架构提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.

Conclusion: 该框架为行为健康、教育和数字治疗等领域的人本应用提供了理论基础，并指出了未来基于模拟验证的实证研究路径，旨在启动关于情感感知和可信个性化系统的伦理对齐强化学习方法讨论。

Abstract: Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.

TL;DR: 该研究使用大语言模型模拟具有认知偏见和意识形态的用户代理，通过审计-节点框架追踪虚假信息在网络中的传播演化，量化事实退化程度，发现身份和意识形态驱动的用户会加速虚假信息传播，而专家型用户能保持事实稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的虚假信息往往利用人类的认知偏见、情感和身份认同来传播。为了研究这些机制，需要一种能够模拟用户层面偏见和意识形态的方法来分析虚假信息的演化过程。

Method: 建立基于大语言模型的合成代理系统，模拟具有不同偏见和意识形态的用户节点。新闻文章在这些节点网络中传播，每个节点重写接收到的内容。通过问题-回答审计机制追踪每一步的事实保真度，并定义虚假信息指数和传播率来量化事实退化。

Result: 在21种用户角色和10个领域的实验中，发现基于身份和意识形态的用户角色会加速虚假信息传播，特别是在政治、营销和技术领域。专家型用户能保持事实稳定性。一旦早期失真出现，异质用户交互会迅速将虚假信息升级到宣传级别的失真。

Conclusion: 大语言模型既能作为人类偏见的代理，又能作为追踪信息保真度的审计工具。该框架为研究、模拟和缓解数字生态系统中的虚假信息传播提供了一种可解释、经验基础的方法。

Abstract: Misinformation on social media thrives on surprise, emotion, and identity-driven reasoning, often amplified through human cognitive biases. To investigate these mechanisms, we model large language model (LLM) personas as synthetic agents that mimic user-level biases, ideological alignments, and trust heuristics. Within this setup, we introduce an auditor--node framework to simulate and analyze how misinformation evolves as it circulates through networks of such agents. News articles are propagated across networks of persona-conditioned LLM nodes, each rewriting received content. A question--answering-based auditor then measures factual fidelity at every step, offering interpretable, claim-level tracking of misinformation drift. We formalize a misinformation index and a misinformation propagation rate to quantify factual degradation across homogeneous and heterogeneous branches of up to 30 sequential rewrites. Experiments with 21 personas across 10 domains reveal that identity- and ideology-based personas act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, marketing, and technology. By contrast, expert-driven personas preserve factual stability. Controlled-random branch simulations further show that once early distortions emerge, heterogeneous persona interactions rapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion. Our taxonomy of misinformation severity -- spanning factual errors, lies, and propaganda -- connects observed drift to established theories in misinformation studies. These findings demonstrate the dual role of LLMs as both proxies for human-like biases and as auditors capable of tracing information fidelity. The proposed framework provides an interpretable, empirically grounded approach for studying, simulating, and mitigating misinformation diffusion in digital ecosystems.
