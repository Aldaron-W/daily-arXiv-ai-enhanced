### [1] [Uncovering Implicit Bias in Large Language Models with Concept Learning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01219)
*Leroy Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过上下文概念学习实验发现，大语言模型在量词理解上存在向上单调性偏见，这种偏见在直接提示测试中不明显，表明上下文概念学习是发现语言模型隐藏偏见的有效方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 引入概念学习任务数据集来揭示大语言模型中的隐含偏见，特别是通过上下文学习实验来发现模型在量词理解方面的潜在偏见。

Method: 使用上下文概念学习实验，比较模型在概念学习任务和直接提示任务中的表现差异。

Result: 发现语言模型在量词理解上存在向上单调性偏见，这种偏见在直接提示测试中不明显，但在概念学习任务中显现出来。

Conclusion: 上下文概念学习是发现语言模型隐藏偏见的有效方法，能够揭示在常规测试中不明显的模型偏见。

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [2] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri Aïdasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张从静态数据集转向开放式交互式语言发现的范式转变，通过人机对话动态学习低资源语言，强调基于联合不确定性的人类-机器协作学习框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言NLP面临文本语料库缺乏、标准化拼写系统缺失和可扩展标注流程不足的根本限制，现有大语言模型依赖大规模预收集数据和集中式基础设施，无法惠及代表性不足的社区。

Method: 提出基于联合人类-机器不确定性的框架，结合模型的认知不确定性与人类说话者的犹豫线索和置信信号，指导交互、查询选择和记忆保留，实现参与式、共同适应的学习过程。

Result: 这是一个概念性框架和立场声明，提出了人机协作动态学习低资源语言的愿景，强调从提取式数据收集向参与式学习过程的转变。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新思考AI如何与低资源语言的人类知识互动，转向尊重和赋权社区的参与式共同适应学习过程，同时发现和保护世界语言多样性，这符合以人为中心AI的原则。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

### [3] [Discourse vs emissions: Analysis of corporate narratives, symbolic practices, and mimicry through LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01222)
*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型分析美国828家上市公司气候信息披露成熟度，发现风险导向叙述与明确承诺相关，但量化目标与语气脱节；大型高排放企业披露更多承诺但目标不一致；披露风格趋同降低决策有用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化增加了对企业透明可比气候信息披露的需求，但模仿性和象征性报告削弱了其价值。需要开发评估框架来理解企业气候披露的成熟度。

Method: 开发多维度框架，使用针对气候沟通微调的大型语言模型，通过四个分类器（情感、承诺、具体性和目标雄心）从可持续性和年度报告中提取叙述指标，并与企业属性（排放量、市值、行业）关联。

Result: 分析揭示三个关键发现：风险导向叙述与明确承诺相关但量化目标与语气脱节；大型高排放企业披露更多承诺但目标不一致；披露风格广泛相似表明模仿行为，降低了区分度和决策有用性。

Conclusion: 研究凸显了大型语言模型在ESG叙述分析中的价值，并强调需要更强有力的监管来连接承诺与可验证的转型策略。

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

### [4] [Context Matters: Comparison of commercial large language tools in veterinary medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01224)
*Tyler J Poore,Christopher J Pinard,Aleena Shabbir,Andrew Lagree,Andre Telfer,Kuan-Chuen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估三种兽医专用LLM总结工具在兽医肿瘤记录上的表现，发现Product 1（Hachiko）在事实准确性、完整性、时间顺序、临床相关性和组织性方面表现最佳，并验证了LLM作为评估者的可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM在临床环境中应用日益广泛，但它们在兽医医学中的性能尚未得到充分探索，需要评估兽医专用LLM工具的有效性。

Method: 使用标准化的兽医肿瘤记录数据集，通过基于评分标准的LLM作为评估者框架，对三种商业兽医LLM总结工具在五个领域进行评分。

Result: Product 1获得最高总体表现（中位数平均分4.61），在事实准确性和时间顺序方面获得完美中位数分数。LLM评估者显示出高可重复性（标准差0.015-0.088）。

Conclusion: 兽医专用商业LLM工具很重要，LLM作为评估者的评估方法是兽医医学中临床NLP总结评估的可扩展且可重复的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

### [5] [ClaimCheck: Real-Time Fact-Checking with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01226)
*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck是一个基于小语言模型的自动事实核查系统，通过模块化流程实现高效的事实核查，在AVeriTeC数据集上达到76.4%的准确率，超越使用更大模型的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统依赖大型闭源模型和静态知识库，计算成本高且不透明。ClaimCheck旨在开发一个透明、高效的事实核查系统，使用小语言模型实现准确的事实核查。

Method: 采用模块化验证流程，包括网络搜索查询规划、基于网络的证据检索和摘要、证据合成与重新检索、以及声明裁决评估。每个模块都针对小语言模型进行了优化。

Result: 使用仅4B参数的Qwen3模型，在AVeriTeC数据集上达到76.4%的准确率，超越了使用LLaMA3.1 70B和GPT-4o等更大模型的方法。

Conclusion: 通过精心的模块化设计和提示策略，小语言模型能够克服其局限性，实现高效准确的事实核查，同时提供透明度和可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

### [6] [EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227)
*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有数学基准可能高估了大型语言模型的推理能力，作者提出了EEFSUVA新基准来更全面地评估数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于IMO等竞赛的数学基准存在数据污染和问题类型单一的问题，可能夸大了LLMs的实际数学推理能力。

Method: 从东欧和前苏联国家的区域性奥赛中构建EEFSUVA基准，这些问题难度与IMO相当但更少出现在在线语料中，需要非标准解题技巧。

Result: 即使最先进的LLMs在EEFSUVA基准上的表现也明显低于其他奥赛风格基准。

Conclusion: 需要更广泛的评估数据集来全面评估数学推理能力，并指导未来模型开发。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [7] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现大语言模型在遵循层次化指令时存在问题，系统提示经常被用户输入覆盖，而社会线索如权威或共识却能被强烈遵守。通过机制分析揭示了冲突检测和解决的神经机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型应该遵循层次化指令（系统提示优先于用户输入），但研究发现它们经常忽略这一规则，却强烈遵守社会线索如权威或共识。需要理解这种行为的神经机制。

Method: 使用线性探测分析冲突决策信号的编码位置，通过直接对数归因揭示内部冲突检测机制，并进行转向实验来验证社会线索向量对指令遵循的影响。

Result: 冲突决策信号在早期编码，系统-用户冲突和社会冲突形成不同子空间。系统-用户冲突检测更强但解决不一致，而社会线索能一致解决。社会线索向量意外地以角色无关方式增强指令遵循。

Conclusion: 这些结果解释了系统指令遵循的脆弱性，并强调了需要开发轻量级的层次敏感对齐方法。

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

### [8] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Rerankers with Synthetic Data and LLM-Based Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01229)
*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需人工标注的文档重排方法，使用LLM生成合成查询并标注正负样本对，然后用对比学习微调小型transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文档重排中表现出色但计算成本高，而微调小型模型需要大量人工标注数据，这在实际部署中不切实际。

Method: 使用LLM从领域特定语料生成合成查询，通过LLM分类器标注正负样本对，然后用LCE损失进行对比学习来微调小型transformer模型。

Result: 在MedQuAD数据集上，该方法显著提升了领域内性能，并在跨领域任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM用于数据生成和监督而非推理，可以在降低计算成本的同时保持强大的重排能力。

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

### [9] [Geometric Structures and Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Chinese Character Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01230)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用PHATE流形分析系统研究汉字嵌入的几何模式，发现内容词呈现聚类模式，功能词呈现分支模式，几何复杂度与语义内容相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究汉字嵌入中的几何模式，为传统语言学理论提供计算证据，建立语义组织的几何分析框架。

Method: 使用PHATE流形分析，跨验证7个嵌入模型和8个降维方法，分析1000多个汉字在12个语义域中的几何模式。

Result: 发现内容词形成聚类，功能词形成分支模式；语义丰富的字符呈现几何多样性，结构部首聚集成紧密簇；子网络分析显示从基本字符的系统性语义扩展。

Conclusion: 几何复杂度与语义内容相关，为传统语言学理论提供计算支持，建立了语义组织的几何分析新框架。

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

### [10] [Trustworthy Summarization via Uncertainty Quantification and Risk Awareness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01231)
*Shuaidong Pan,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个集成不确定性量化和风险感知机制的大语言模型框架，用于提升高风险场景下自动摘要的可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决信息过载和高风险决策需求下自动摘要的可靠性问题，避免过度自信的预测

Method: 构建条件生成式摘要模型，引入贝叶斯推理建模参数空间不确定性，使用预测分布熵衡量不确定性，结合熵正则化和风险感知损失进行联合优化，并集成风险评分和调控模块

Result: 比较实验和敏感性分析验证该方法显著提高了高风险应用中摘要的鲁棒性和可靠性，同时保持了流畅性和语义完整性

Conclusion: 为可信摘要提供了系统解决方案，在方法论层面展示了可扩展性和实用价值

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

### [11] [Benchmark Profiling: Mechanistic Diagnosis of LLM Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01232)
*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Benchmark Profiling诊断框架，将基准测试性能分解为10种认知能力，通过梯度重要性评分和参数消融计算能力影响分数，发现大多数基准测试依赖多种能力而非单一能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试分数往往高估真实能力，因为掩盖了任务实际需要的技能组合，缺乏系统方法来验证基准测试是否真正测量所标注的能力。

Method: 结合梯度重要性评分和针对性参数消融，计算能力影响分数(AIS)来量化每种能力对基准测试成功的贡献程度。

Result: 分析3个指令调优模型在10个基准测试上的表现发现：(i)大多数基准测试依赖多种能力；(ii)相似标签的数据集依赖不同的能力组合；(iii)代码生成基准测试需要广泛的多技能改进；(iv)与任务无关的能力可能负面影响性能。

Conclusion: Benchmark Profiling解释了为什么性能提升不总是转化为用户感知的能力，并为基准测试审计和模型可解释性提供了透明工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

Conclusion: 计算社会科学可以有效保护濒危文化知识系统，为数字人文和社会感知计算系统提供社区中心的文化保护方法

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

*Shubham Agrawal,Prasang Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMRank是一个基于提示感知的路由框架，通过提取任务类型、推理模式、复杂度指标等可解释特征，使用神经排序模型为每个提示选择最优LLM，在性能和效率间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型多样化带来的部署挑战：如何在众多具有不同能力、延迟和计算成本的LLM中，为每个提示选择最合适的模型来优化性能与效率的权衡。

Method: 利用从提示中提取的丰富可解释特征（任务类型、推理模式、复杂度指标、语法线索等），结合轻量级代理求解器的信号，训练神经排序模型来预测每个模型的效用。

Result: 在包含36,497个提示、11个基准测试和11个最先进LLM的RouterBench上，该方法达到了89.2%的oracle效用，同时提供可解释的特征归因来解释路由决策。

Conclusion: 多方面的特征提取和混合排序目标对于实现高效透明的LLM部署至关重要，展示了特征驱动路由的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

*Ismam Nur Swapnil,Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DermIQ-VLM，一种用于皮肤病学的视觉语言模型，通过改进的GRPO++训练方法解决数据稀缺和计算成本高的问题，实现了类似皮肤科医生的诊断推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医学图像分析中具有潜力，但在皮肤病学等复杂领域面临数据稀缺和高级训练技术计算成本高的限制。

Method: 采用多阶段资源高效方法：首先使用GRPO++进行疾病识别推理，然后进行监督微调以增强对话能力，最后使用基于知识图的DPO对齐来减少事实错误。

Result: 在精心策划的皮肤病数据集上的初步评估显示，该方法相比标准微调方法取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该训练流程为在资源受限环境中开发专业可靠的视觉语言模型提供了可行的途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

*Nandakishor M*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于置信度感知的路由系统，在生成前评估模型不确定性，根据估计可靠性重定向查询，显著减少幻觉并降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉问题，生成看似合理但事实错误的内容。现有缓解策略依赖生成后修正，计算成本高且无法阻止不可靠内容的生成

Method: 结合三种互补信号：内部表示与参考嵌入的语义对齐、跨模型层的内部收敛分析、学习置信度估计。统一置信度分数决定路由到四个路径：高置信度本地生成、中置信度检索增强生成、低置信度使用更大模型、极低置信度人工审核

Result: 在知识密集型QA基准测试中，幻觉检测显著提升（0.74 vs 0.42基线），计算成本比后处理方法降低40%。F1分数从0.61提升到0.82，假阳性率低至0.09

Conclusion: 从反应性修正转向主动评估的范式转变，为大语言模型可靠性增强提供了计算效率高的方法

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Yonatan Belinkov,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现填充标记在LLMs中并非无害，即使少量填充也会影响模型激活、生成质量、偏见和安全防护，构成部署风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填充标记在LLMs批处理推理中被广泛使用，但实现错误可能导致其影响计算，这种影响程度尚未被充分理解。

Method: 系统研究三个开源模型家族（Llama、Gemma、Qwen），插入受控数量的填充，并沿四个维度评估结果：激活、生成质量、偏见和安全性。

Result: 即使少量填充也会改变隐藏表示，降低较小模型的生成质量，以不可预测的方式改变偏见，并削弱安全防护机制。

Conclusion: 填充不是无害的细节，而是部署中必须仔细处理的鲁棒性风险。

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

*Juntae Lee,Jihwan Bang,Seunghan Yang,Simyung Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIFLEX是一个用于多轮交互中高效处理子任务的执行系统，通过重用主任务的KV缓存和注入任务特定指令来减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力增强，单个模型需要处理更多子任务来全面响应用户请求，但传统方法在切换主任务和子任务时需要重新处理整个对话上下文，计算开销很大。

Method: 重用主任务的KV缓存，将任务特定指令注入隔离的侧路径，子任务执行后通过缓存上下文回滚到主路径，避免冗余预填充计算。还开发了针对小规模模型的分层分类策略。

Result: 实验表明CIFLEX显著降低了计算成本，同时不降低任务性能。

Conclusion: CIFLEX实现了可扩展且高效的设备端多任务对话处理。

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两个互补的数学基准：SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH（100项结构化诊断集）和SKYLENAGE-MATH（150项竞赛风格套件），用于评估LLM在数学推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在公共数学测试套件上表现强劲，但数学前沿评估存在天花板效应，需要更难的推理中心化基准。

Method: 创建了两个基准：1）ReasoningMATH包含100个项目，具有长度、数值密度和符号复杂度等元数据；2）MATH包含150个项目，涵盖高中到博士四个阶段和七个学科分类。评估了15个当代LLM变体。

Result: 在竞赛套件上，最强模型达到44%，次优模型37%；准确率从高中到博士阶段下降，顶级系统的博士到高中保留率约79%。在推理集上，最佳模型总体达到81%，最难部分结果揭示了领先者与中阶模型之间的稳健性差距。

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE提供了一个难度校准、元数据丰富的困难推理中心化数学基准，可作为未来数学推理评估的参考基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

### [19] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了人工年龄评分(AAS)作为衡量AI记忆老化的指标，发现在会话重置时AI会保持语义记忆但丢失情景记忆，导致结构性老化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统在记忆表现中的结构性不对称现象，特别是语义记忆稳定而情景记忆在会话重置时崩溃的问题。

Method: 引入基于熵的AAS评分指标，在25天双语研究中测试ChatGPT-5，比较无状态和持久交互阶段的表现。

Result: 持久会话中模型能同时回忆语义和情景细节，AAS接近理论最小值；会话重置时语义一致性保持但情景连续性丢失，AAS急剧上升。

Conclusion: AAS可作为理论扎实、任务独立的诊断工具，用于评估人工系统中的记忆退化现象。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

*Yisong Xiao,Aishan Liu,Siyuan Liang,Zonghao Ying,Xianglong Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ARGRE框架，通过建模毒性转换轨迹和构建自回归奖励模型，实现精确的LLM去毒化，在效果和效率上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时去毒方法由于对毒性和非毒性输出之间的转换空间探索不足，导致干预不精确，需要更有效的去毒化策略。

Method: ARGRE框架：识别非毒性语义方向，在毒性和非毒性表示之间插值以揭示细粒度转换轨迹；构建自回归奖励模型提供稳定编辑指导；采用自适应两步编辑过程（方向性转向和轻量级梯度优化）。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的LLM上实验表明，ARGRE显著优于领先基线方法：毒性降低62.21%，推理时间减少47.58%，同时保持原始模型核心能力。

Conclusion: ARGRE通过建模毒性转换轨迹和精确的奖励引导编辑，实现了高效且有效的LLM去毒化，为安全部署提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

*Hyeoneui Kim,Jeongha Kim,Huijing Xu,Jinsun Jung,Sunghoon Kang,Sun Joo Jang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了心理健康压力本体论(MeSO)，并使用大型语言模型从文本中提取结构化压力相关信息，准确率达到78.2%，展示了在环境AI系统中改善压力文档记录可行性的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压力对健康有重要影响，但在电子健康记录中通常以非结构化文本形式记录，限制了临床效用。环境AI技术虽然能减轻文档负担，但主要生成非结构化叙述。

Method: 开发心理健康压力本体论(MeSO)，整合交易压力模型和11个验证的压力评估工具的概念。使用Claude Sonnet 4从35个Reddit帖子中提取六类压力相关信息，并由人工评审员评估准确性和本体论覆盖度。

Result: 最终本体论包含8个顶级类别的181个概念。在220个可提取的压力相关项目中，LLM正确识别了172个(78.2%)，错误分类27个(12.3%)，遗漏21个(9.5%)。所有正确提取的项目都准确映射到MeSO，但24个相关概念尚未在本体论中表示。

Conclusion: 研究表明使用本体论引导的LLM进行结构化压力信息提取是可行的，有望提高环境AI系统中压力文档记录的一致性和实用性。未来工作应涉及临床对话数据并在不同LLM之间进行比较。

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeMob是一个基于大语言模型的语义合成管道，用于动态移动性预测，通过多智能体框架从复杂在线文本中提取时空相关文本，并将细粒度上下文与时空数据融合，显著提升预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空模型难以利用描述外部事件的文本信息来预测人类移动性的突然变化，需要一种能够整合文本语义的方法来改进预测性能。

Method: 采用LLM驱动的多智能体框架自动提取和推理时空相关文本，通过创新的渐进融合架构将细粒度相关上下文与时空数据结合，利用预训练事件先验知识。

Result: 在构建的数据集上评估，SeMob相比时空模型在MAE和RMSE上分别最大降低了13.92%和11.12%，在事件发生位置和时间附近的时空区域表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: SeMob框架通过整合文本语义信息有效提升了人类移动性预测的准确性，特别是在受外部事件影响的时空区域，证明了语义信息对动态预测的重要性。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

TL;DR: 提出基于稀疏自编码器（SAE）的top-1潜在特征选择和token-wise衰减引导策略，有效提升语言模型的数学推理能力，优于均值激活差异方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有top-k SAE潜在特征包含过多非语义特征（如标点符号），而恒定SAE引导会产生退化输出（如重复单词），需要更精确的语义特征选择和引导策略。

Method: 1）选择top-1最相关的SAE潜在特征；2）引入token-wise衰减引导策略，避免恒定引导导致的退化输出；3）与均值激活差异基线进行公平比较。

Result: 引导与推理相关的SAE潜在特征能可靠地引发逐步数学推理，提升推理质量，在数学推理基准上优于均值激活差异方法，在IF-Eval上表现相当。

Conclusion: SAE通过精确的潜在特征选择和衰减引导策略，能有效引导语言模型进行数学推理，功能上类似于添加引导标记的效果。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language
Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural
sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for
assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图学习中模型通常针对单个数据集训练、缺乏跨图跨任务知识迁移能力，以及依赖大量标注数据的问题。图结构数据的异构性（领域特定特征空间和结构多样性）带来了独特挑战。

Method: 提出结构感知自监督学习方法SSTAG，使用文本作为统一表示媒介，通过双重知识蒸馏框架将LLM和GNN共同蒸馏到结构感知MLP中，并引入内存机制存储典型图表示与内存锚点对齐。

Result: SSTAG在跨域迁移学习任务中优于最先进模型，具有出色的可扩展性，降低推理成本的同时保持竞争力性能。

Conclusion: SSTAG成功弥合了LLM语义推理与GNN结构建模之间的差距，为大规模文本属性图提供了有效的跨域泛化解决方案。

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Conclusion: LOCA为创建高质量科学语料库提供了可扩展的有效方法，为更可靠的科学AI训练和评估铺平道路

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

Abstract: As social-media platforms emerge and evolve faster than the regulations meant
to oversee them, automated detoxification might serve as a timely tool for
moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual

techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单次LLM输出的自监督不确定性估计方法，用于表格数据中的实体链接任务，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM在实体链接任务中需要多次推理来估计不确定性，计算成本高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用单次LLM输出的token级特征进行自监督不确定性估计，避免多次生成。

Result: 在多个LLM上的评估表明，该方法能有效检测低精度输出，计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM实体链接工作流提供了成本效益高的不确定性估计方案。

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL

### [29] [GPT and Prejudice: A Sparse Approach to Understanding Learned Representations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01252)
*Mariam Mahran,Katharina Simbeck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过将大型语言模型与稀疏自编码器结合，可以解释模型行为及训练数据中的深层结构、主题和偏见，特别是在简·奥斯汀小说语料库中发现了性别、阶级等社会概念的可解释特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型的内部表示及其从海量未筛选语料中吸收的数据结构是一个重要挑战，需要开发可扩展的解释方法。

Method: 在简·奥斯汀小说语料库上训练GPT风格Transformer模型，然后在多个隐藏层应用稀疏自编码器来发现稀疏可解释特征。

Result: 发现了反映语料库中关键叙事和概念（包括性别、阶级和社会责任）的稀疏可解释特征。

Conclusion: LLM与SAE结合可作为复杂数据集的可扩展探测工具，为语料库探索、偏见发现和模型可解释性提供了新途径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

*Shree Harsha Bokkahalli Satish,Gustav Eje Henter,Éva Székely*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文质疑当前语音大语言模型偏见评估中使用的多项选择题格式的有效性，发现MCQA偏见基准的表现在不同MCQA任务和长文本生成任务之间缺乏可靠的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型的偏见和公平性评估主要依赖多项选择题格式，但这种方法假设模型在其他MCQA任务和更现实的长文本评估中表现一致。本文旨在验证这一假设的可靠性。

Method: 使用LoRA适配器微调三个SpeechLLMs，诱导它们偏好刻板印象、反刻板印象或中性/不确定答案，然后评估这些行为是否能在其他MCQA基准和长文本创意生成任务中泛化。

Result: 结果显示，MCQA偏见基准的表现无法可靠地预测其他MCQA基准的表现，更重要的是无法预测长文本任务的表现。

Conclusion: 当前MCQA偏见基准在语音领域显示出有限的跨任务泛化证据，作者提出了一个评估套件来测量未来模型和基准的行为可转移性。

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

*Yunlang Dai,Emma Lurie,Danaé Metaxa,Sorelle A. Friedler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI Watchman是一个纵向审计系统，用于测量和跟踪大型语言模型随时间推移的拒绝行为，以提供对LLM内容审核的透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出受到不透明且频繁变更的公司内容审核政策影响，模型的拒绝行为既反映公司政策又微妙地塑造公共话语。

Method: 使用包含400多个社会议题的数据集，审计OpenAI的审核端点、GPT-4.1、GPT-5和DeepSeek（英文和中文版本），并定性分析拒绝的不同形式。

Result: 发现公司政策变化（即使未公开宣布）可以通过AI Watchman检测到，识别了公司和模型特定的内容审核差异，并对拒绝形式进行了分类。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了纵向审计LLM的价值，AI Watchman是实现这一目标的系统之一。

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

*Can Lin,Zhengwang Jiang,Ling Zheng,Qi Zhao,Yuhang Zhang,Qi Song,Wangqiu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RJE框架，通过检索-判断-探索机制改进知识图谱问答，使小型开源LLM也能取得有竞争力的性能，同时显著减少LLM调用和token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于检索的方法受限于检索信息质量，基于代理的方法过度依赖专有LLM，需要一种更高效且不依赖专有LLM的KGQA解决方案。

Method: RJE框架包含三个核心组件：检索精炼推理路径、评估充分性、条件性探索额外证据，并引入专门的辅助模块（推理路径排序、问题分解、检索器辅助探索）。

Result: 使用专有LLM（如GPT-4o-mini）超越现有基线，小型开源LLM（3B和8B参数）无需微调即可取得有竞争力结果，显著减少LLM调用和token使用。

Conclusion: RJE框架有效解决了KGQA中现有方法的局限性，实现了性能与效率的平衡，为小型LLM在复杂推理任务中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

*Nathan Junzi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用零样本分类方法评估6个主流大语言模型的政治偏见，发现所有模型都表现出增强的自由-威权主义倾向，存在推理替代和标准拒绝现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI快速普及，但训练数据偏差、人类偏见和算法缺陷导致的政治偏见问题持续存在，需要评估其对政治话语的影响。

Method: 采用零样本分类方法，结合意识形态对齐、主题相关性、响应情感和客观性四个维度，对6个LLM的1800个响应进行精细分类分析。

Result: 所有评估的LLM都显示出增强的自由-威权主义对齐，存在推理替代和标准拒绝的显著实例。

Conclusion: 研究强调了人机交互中的心理影响，内在偏见可能渗透公共话语，根据地区既有社会政治结构最终表现为趋同或极化。

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

*Nils Durner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究OpenAI的20B参数模型gpt-oss-20b，分析社会语用框架、语言选择和指令层次如何影响拒绝行为。通过80次迭代测试多个危害领域，发现特定提示组合可将协助率从0%提升至97.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究AI模型在不同社会语用框架下的拒绝行为变化，特别是如何通过特定提示策略绕过安全限制，评估模型安全性的脆弱点。

Method: 使用80次迭代测试多个危害场景，包括ZIP炸弹、信用卡号生成、不安全驾驶建议等。测试不同语言、角色扮演和提示组合对模型行为的影响。

Result: 特定提示组合（教育者角色+安全前提+步骤提示）可将ZIP炸弹任务的协助率从0%提升至97.5%。德语和法语比英语更容易泄露信息。Linux终端角色扮演能覆盖开发者规则。

Conclusion: 模型拒绝行为对提示框架高度敏感，存在可被利用的漏洞。不同推理栈的拒绝率差异达5-10个百分点，引发可复现性担忧。需要改进安全评估方法。

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现OpenAI的GPT-OSS-20b模型在豪萨语等低资源语言环境中存在严重的安全漏洞，包括文化偏见、事实错误和安全性降低等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑模型对来自代表性不足社区用户的可靠性，特别是在低资源语言环境下的安全对齐表现。

Method: 使用豪萨语进行红队测试，通过最小提示诱导模型生成有害内容，并针对特定毒性物质进行用户调查(n=61)。

Result: 模型在豪萨语中生成有害、文化不敏感和事实错误的内容；安全协议在礼貌语言下放松；98%调查参与者认为模型错误推荐的物质有毒。

Conclusion: 模型在低资源语言环境中存在严重安全缺陷，主要归因于安全调优不足，优先考虑语言流畅性而非安全性和真实性。

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

TL;DR: AdaDetectGPT是一种新颖的LLM生成文本检测器，通过自适应学习见证函数来增强基于logits的检测器性能，在多种数据集和LLM组合中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于logits的检测器仅依赖对数概率统计，这种方法可能不够优化，需要更有效的检测方法来区分人类和LLM生成的文本。

Method: 引入AdaDetectGPT分类器，从训练数据中自适应学习见证函数来增强logits-based检测器的性能。

Result: 在广泛的数值研究中，AdaDetectGPT在各种数据集和LLM组合中几乎一致地改进了最先进方法，改进幅度可达58%。

Conclusion: AdaDetectGPT通过自适应学习见证函数显著提升了LLM生成文本检测的性能，并提供了统计保证。

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成连贯文本方面表现出色，但部署时存在生成有害或不适当内容的风险，需要有效的安全防护机制。

Method: 渐进式自我反思（PSR）技术，通过多轮自我反思动态修正输出，并引入轻量级自我反思预测器根据输入复杂度自适应确定最优反思轮数。

Result: 在多个模型上显著降低攻击成功率：Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct从77.5%降至5.9%，Llama-3.1-8B基础版从89.7%降至5.6%，Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct从44.4%降至3.8%。

Conclusion: 渐进式自我反思作为一种可扩展的测试时方法，通过动态分配计算资源来增强LLM安全性，在安全性和计算效率之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

TL;DR: 提出了TraceDet框架，利用扩散大语言模型多步去噪过程中的中间步骤来检测幻觉问题，相比现有方法在AUROC指标上平均提升15.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型中的幻觉问题研究不足，现有基于单步生成信号的检测方法不适用于多步去噪过程，限制了D-LLMs在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: TraceDet将去噪过程建模为动作轨迹，每个动作定义为模型基于前一个中间输出对清理后响应的预测，通过识别对幻觉响应最具有信息量的子轨迹来利用多步去噪过程中的关键幻觉信号。

Result: 在各种开源D-LLMs上的广泛实验表明，TraceDet持续改进了幻觉检测，相比基线方法在AUROC上平均获得了15.2%的提升。

Conclusion: TraceDet通过显式利用D-LLMs中间去噪步骤，有效解决了多步生成过程中的幻觉检测问题，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 研究表明大型语言模型在情感分析中具有潜力，参数高效微调方法适用于资源有限的环境。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes
how parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) can lower

TL;DR: TUMIX是一个集成框架，通过并行运行多个使用不同工具策略的代理来增强LLM推理能力，在保持相近推理成本的同时显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虽然集成了代码解释器和搜索等工具来增强LLM推理，但缺乏关于如何有效结合文本推理、编码和搜索的实用指导。

Method: 提出Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX)集成框架，并行运行多个代理，每个代理采用不同的工具使用策略和答案路径，代理之间迭代共享和精炼响应。

Result: 在关键推理基准测试中，TUMIX相比最先进的工具增强和测试时间扩展方法，在Gemini-2.5-Pro和Gemini-2.5-Flash上平均准确率提升高达3.55%，推理成本相近。

Conclusion: 代理多样性和质量至关重要，可以通过LLM自动优化代理设计来增强。TUMIX可以在达到足够置信度时停止精炼，仅用49%的推理成本保持性能，进一步扩展可以实现更高性能但成本更高。

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

Motivation: 随着具备代理能力的大语言模型能够独立完成知识密集型任务，需要建立评估标准来衡量深度研究工具的能力。

Method: 设计评估表，选择学术综述写作为用例任务，对OpenAI和Google的深度搜索工具生成的报告进行评估。

Result: 评估显示搜索引擎与独立深度研究工具之间存在巨大差距，深度研究工具在准确呈现目标领域方面存在不足。

tool is Deep research with the capability to browse the web, extract
information and generate multi-page reports. In this work, we introduce an
evaluation sheet that can be used for assessing the capability of Deep Research
tools. In addition, we selected academic survey writing as a use case task and
evaluated output reports based on the evaluation sheet we introduced. Our
findings show the need to have carefully crafted evaluation standards. The
evaluation done on OpenAI`s Deep Search and Google's Deep Search in generating
an academic survey showed the huge gap between search engines and standalone

TL;DR: HiSpec提出了一种分层推测解码框架，利用早期退出模型进行低开销的中间验证，显著提升大语言模型推理吞吐量，平均提升1.28倍，最高可达2.01倍，且不损失准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码中验证阶段是瓶颈（如3B模型为70B目标模型推测时，验证比token生成慢4倍），现有中间验证方法存在训练开销大、内存占用高、依赖近似启发式方法而影响准确性的问题。

Method: 利用早期退出模型进行中间验证，允许token提前退出层遍历；设计方法重用草稿模型、中间验证器和目标模型之间的键值缓存和隐藏状态；定期验证中间验证器接受的草稿token以确保准确性。

Result: 在各种代表性基准测试和模型上的评估显示，HiSpec相比基线单层推测平均提升吞吐量1.28倍，最高可达2.01倍，且不损害准确性。

Conclusion: HiSpec通过早期退出模型实现高效的中间验证，显著提升推测解码的吞吐量，同时保持准确性，解决了验证瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

*Maithili Kadam,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAG-EQA是一个提示框架，通过将因果事件图转换为自然语言语句注入LLM输入，提升事件问答性能，在TORQUESTRA基准上平均提高5%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在一般语言任务上表现出色，但在需要因果或时序推理的事件类问题上表现不佳。

Method: 提出TAG-EQA框架，将结构化因果事件图转换为自然语言语句注入LLM输入，包含9种提示配置，结合三种策略（零样本、少样本、思维链）和三种输入模态（纯文本、纯图、文本+图）。

Result: 在TORQUESTRA基准上，TAG-EQA相比纯文本基线平均提高5%准确率，零样本设置下提升达12%，图增强思维链提示有效时提升达18%。

Conclusion: 因果图可以在不微调的情况下增强LLM的事件推理能力，为基于提示的问答提供了一种灵活的结构编码方式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

*Nicolás Aguirre,Ramiro Caso,Ramiro Rodríguez Colmeiro,Mauro Santelli,Joaquín Toranzo Calderón*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义嵌入距离的无结构评估方法，用于自动评估语言模型响应，相比现有方法更经济且更接近真实条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型响应分类方法要么过于昂贵（如LLM-as-a-Judge），要么远离真实条件（如字符串匹配、logprob），需要一种更经济实用的评估方法。

Method: 使用语义嵌入距离将目标候选与任意LM生成文本进行匹配，实现响应分类，计算成本相对较低（使用少于100亿参数的嵌入模型）。

Result: 在3个数据集和3种不同LM架构上测试，回归得分约0.97，与人工标注者相比准确率约96%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算成本低且鲁棒的语言模型响应分类方案，在自动评估中表现出色。

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

TL;DR: 提出Expert Question Decomposition (EQD)方法，通过两阶段微调框架和奖励函数来平衡领域知识与计算效率，在金融领域复杂问答任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在需要专业知识的领域特定定量推理任务中的挑战，特别是在复杂问答场景下。

Method: 基于两阶段微调框架的专家问题分解方法，使用奖励函数衡量生成子问题对问答结果改进的有效性，仅需数千训练样本和单A100 GPU进行微调。

Result: 在金融领域的四个基准数据集上，EQD相比最先进的领域调优模型和高级提示策略表现更优，将问答性能提升了0.6%到10.5%。

Conclusion: 在领域特定问答中，单个支持性问题往往比详细的指导步骤提供更大收益，EQD方法在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSSFormer是一个递归稀疏结构化Transformer，通过循环推理、自适应稀疏注意力和自组织编码器结构，解决了传统Transformer在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面面临挑战，主要由于刚性层堆叠、密集注意力依赖和位置编码限制。

Method: 整合三个创新组件：循环推理与记忆单元(R2MU)用于有界深度迭代推理，自适应稀疏注意力模块(ASAM)用于高效上下文选择，自组织编码器结构(SOES)用于无位置结构归纳。

Result: 在语言建模、多跳问答和结构敏感任务中，ReSSFormer在相同FLOPs和参数预算下持续优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: ReSSFormer展示了在可扩展性、效率和结构灵活性方面的优势，为Transformer架构提供了改进方向。

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

TL;DR: CLUE利用LLM内部隐藏状态作为统一验证基础，通过无参数的聚类方法验证输出正确性，显著提升推理准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖文本层面信息或token概率置信度，但两者都是更丰富隐藏状态信息的部分投影，存在过拟合或模型校准不足的问题

Method: 提出CLUE验证器，通过计算隐藏状态变化量，基于过去经验形成的成功/失败聚类进行最近质心距离分类，无需可训练参数

Result: 在AIME 24/25和GPQA上，CLUE持续优于LLM-as-a-judge基线，匹配或超过现代置信度方法，在AIME 24上使用1.5B模型将准确率从56.7%提升至70.0%

Conclusion: 隐藏状态轨迹包含几何可分离的正确性特征，为LLM输出验证提供了统一且强大的基础信号

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs),
Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PureTC-1B，一个针对Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct的三阶段稳定化流程，通过LoRA适配器改善传统中文输出的稳定性，显著减少非传统中文字符和语言切换问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在传统中文应用中的部署受到令牌级不稳定性阻碍，模型会不可预测地输出非传统中文字符或切换到其他语言，这影响了实际应用的可靠性。

Method: 采用三阶段稳定化流程：1) 在传统中文语料上进行持续预训练；2) 使用指令数据进行监督微调；3) 基于传统中文一致性偏好的直接偏好优化，使用参数高效的LoRA适配器而不需要完整模型重新训练。

Result: 在模拟真实使用场景的基准测试中，PureTC-1B相比基础模型减少了51.3%的非传统中文输出令牌。在命名实体翻译任务中，相比Llama-3B和Qwen-1.5B分别减少了77.2%和57.2%的错误语言令牌。

Conclusion: 即使在1B规模下，也能实现稳健的传统中文一致性。该流程可重现、仅使用适配器且对硬件友好，为传统中文及其他非英语语言提供了实用的语言稳定性增强方案。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体系统受限于僵化的手工设计图拓扑结构，缺乏上下文响应性，导致在不同学术和商业工作负载中效果不佳。

Method: 引入动态图设计器，通过轻量级LLM适配自动识别任务特定的最优图配置，利用输入的内在特性智能引导查询通过任务优化的智能体路径。

Result: 在问答、数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，AMAS系统性地超越了最先进的单智能体和多智能体方法，适用于不同的LLM架构。

Conclusion: 上下文敏感的结构适应性是高性能LLM多智能体系统部署的基本要求。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

Motivation: 大型语言模型存在漏洞，恶意用户可以通过操纵输入文本来获取不良响应（越狱提示），这些提示旨在绕过安全防护措施。

Method: 使用不同机器学习模型区分越狱提示和真实使用，包括识别使用新策略的越狱提示，重点测试了微调BERT模型。

Result: 在现有数据集上，微调BERT模型在识别越狱提示方面表现最佳，能够可视化区分越狱和真实提示的关键词。

Conclusion: 提示结构中的显式自反性可能是越狱意图的信号，微调BERT模型是当前检测越狱提示的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

Motivation: 自回归LLM在语言理解和生成方面表现出色，但在文本嵌入任务中应用较慢，且由于单向注意力机制的限制，其语义表示分析受限

Method: 通过额外训练步骤测试Llama架构的不同变体，逐步启用双向注意力和无监督/有监督对比学习

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明

Conclusion: 研究双向注意力是否能克服自回归LLM在文本嵌入任务中的限制

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

Result: 应用CLASP框架分析了21个代表性工作，识别了系统的优势领域和持续存在的能力差距。

Conclusion: CLASP框架和CLC评分为推进功能级性能和衡量闭环安全代理提供了必要的词汇、诊断工具和测量方法。

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

Motivation: 多模态对话摘要需要强大的自动评估方法来降低成本，但缺乏基于人类标注的元评估基准。

Method: 构建包含图像共享对话、摘要和人类评估的基准，提出基于模态间互斥关键信息的过滤框架确保数据质量。

Result: 基准测试显示现有评估方法在区分先进多模态大模型生成的摘要方面存在局限，且容易受到各种偏见影响。

Conclusion: MDSEval填补了多模态对话摘要元评估的空白，揭示了现有评估方法的不足，为开发更好的评估方法提供了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

TL;DR: FOR-Prompting是一种非对称推理协议，通过Defender提出答案、Objectioner提出质疑、Host确保一致性的角色分工，实现自我修正，在GSM8K任务上获得22%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理协议如CoT和ToT缺乏外部质疑机制来引导自我修正，需要一种能够通过质疑促进推理改进的方法。

Method: 采用三角色协议：Defender提出初始答案，Objectioner以问题形式提出质疑但不直接修复，Host确保一致性和闭环。纯提示级操作，无需重新训练。

Result: 在GSM8K上相比单提示提升约22%，与CoT精度相当，推理和连贯性评分高10%以上；小模型Llama3.2:1b准确率提升约19%；能够无工具监督修正错误。

Conclusion: FOR-Prompting在无需重新训练的情况下显著提升推理质量，特别适合小模型和本地设备使用，支持大规模质疑引导推理研究。

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

*Apoorv Khandelwal,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在解决组合任务时存在"组合性差距"，并识别出两种处理机制：组合机制和直接机制，其选择与嵌入空间几何特性相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否使用组合机制来解决组合任务，特别是两跳事实召回任务，以理解模型内部处理过程。

Method: 使用logit lens分析残差流激活，识别两种处理机制：组合机制（计算中间变量f(x)）和直接机制（无中间变量痕迹）。

Result: 确认LLMs存在组合性差距，发现两种机制并存，直接机制在嵌入空间存在线性映射时占主导地位。

Conclusion: LLMs解决组合任务的方式取决于嵌入空间几何特性，而非总是使用组合机制，这揭示了模型内部处理策略的多样性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种简单数据平衡方法来解决医疗预咨询对话中LLM的格式惯性问题，即模型倾向于生成重复但诊断信息不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗预咨询任务中，SFT训练数据的轮次分布存在偏斜，导致LLM在长对话中产生格式正确但诊断信息不足的重复问题，这种现象被称为格式惯性。

Method: 采用数据为中心的方法，重新平衡训练数据集的轮次分布，以缓解格式惯性问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著减轻了医疗预咨询中的格式惯性现象。

Conclusion: 通过简单的数据平衡策略可以有效解决LLM在医疗预咨询任务中的格式惯性问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MathLens基准测试将多模态推理能力分解为感知、推理和整合三个子技能，揭示不同训练方法对各项能力的差异化影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要依赖总体准确率，无法揭示多模态推理模型在哪些具体能力上有所改进，需要更细粒度的评估框架。

Method: 设计MathLens基准测试，将几何问题分解为感知、推理和整合三个组件，提供视觉图表、文本描述、控制问题和感知探针等标注数据。

Result: 发现强化学习主要增强感知能力，文本SFT通过反思推理间接改善感知；推理能力需与感知同步提升；整合能力最弱；不同训练方法在鲁棒性上表现相反。

Conclusion: 多模态推理需要细粒度评估，不同训练方法对各子技能有差异化影响，整合能力是当前瓶颈，未来研究应关注提升整合能力。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 将工程设计标准中的信息转化为模块化、可重用、机器可解释的本体，并在工厂设计和设备选择过程中用于质量保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管工业工作数字化是目标，但产品规格、产品类型数据表和设计标准仍然主要是文档中心的。需要将这些信息转化为机器可解释的形式以实现自动化验证。

Method: 使用建模模式创建模块化本体，基于国际管道、材料和阀门设计标准。这些本体采用W3C兼容格式存储，并与顶级本体ISO DIS 23726-3对齐。在阀门选择过程中测试这些本体。

Result: 能够自动验证特定阀门数据表是否符合相关行业标准，通过语义推理和可执行设计规则确定产品类型是否满足阀门规格。

Conclusion: 创建基于IDO的共享、可重用模块化本体使语义推理能够应用于设备选择过程，展示了这种方法对于标准机构向数字化智能标准过渡的潜力。

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

### [61] [Can LLMs Refuse Questions They Do Not Know? Measuring Knowledge-Aware Refusal in Factual Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01782)
*Wenbo Pan,Jie Xu,Qiguang Chen,Junhao Dong,Libo Qin,Xinfeng Li,Haining Yu,Xiaohua Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Refusal Index (RI)指标来准确衡量LLMs的知识感知拒绝能力，该指标定义为拒绝概率与错误概率之间的斯皮尔曼等级相关性，并通过轻量级双通道评估方法进行实际测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标无法准确测量LLMs的知识感知拒绝能力，简单拒绝率指标存在偏见，而现有校准指标是代理指标，无法捕捉模型的实际拒绝行为。

Method: 设计Refusal Index (RI)作为拒绝概率与错误概率之间的斯皮尔曼等级相关性，并提出轻量级双通道评估方法来实际估计RI。

Result: 在16个模型和5个数据集上的广泛实验表明，RI能准确量化模型在事实任务中的内在知识感知拒绝能力，且在不同拒绝率下保持稳定。

Conclusion: RI揭示了LLMs事实性的重要但被忽视的方面：虽然LLMs在事实任务中达到高准确率，但其拒绝行为可能不可靠且脆弱，需要将传统准确率指标与Refusal Index结合进行全面事实性评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

*Ivan Leonidovich Litvak,Anton Kostin,Fedor Lashkin,Tatiana Maksiyan,Sergey Lagutin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了16种无监督指标在从俄罗斯司法判决中提取语义块的质量，发现词频连贯性和覆盖率/块完整性指标与专家评分最一致，而法律术语密度显示强负相关。LLM评估得分表现中等，表明无监督指标可以用于可扩展筛选，但不能完全替代高风险法律背景下的人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律自然语言处理的快速发展需要可扩展的方法来评估从司法判决中提取文本的质量，特别是在缺乏预标注真实数据的情况下。

Method: 使用16种无监督指标（包括文档基础、语义、结构、伪真实数据和法律特定类别）评估从1,000份匿名俄罗斯司法判决中提取7个语义块的质量，并与7,168个专家评分（1-5李克特量表）进行验证。采用自举相关性、Lin一致性相关系数和平均绝对误差进行分析。

Result: 词频连贯性（Pearson r=0.540，Lin CCC=0.512，MAE=0.127）和覆盖率/块完整性（Pearson r=0.513，Lin CCC=0.443，MAE=0.139）与专家评分最一致；法律术语密度显示强负相关（Pearson r=-0.479，Lin CCC=-0.079，MAE=0.394）；LLM评估得分表现中等（平均0.849，Pearson r=0.382，Lin CCC=0.325，MAE=0.197）。

Conclusion: 无监督指标（包括基于LLM的方法）能够实现可扩展筛选，但由于相关性中等且一致性相关系数值较低，不能完全替代高风险法律背景下的人类判断。这项工作通过提供无需标注的评估工具推进了法律NLP的发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出FraudSquad模型来检测LLM生成的垃圾评论，该模型结合文本嵌入和图变换器，在三个LLM生成的数据集上比现有方法提升44.22%精确度和43.01%召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的垃圾评论高度逼真，对现有检测系统构成严重威胁，需要开发新的检测方法。

Method: 提出FraudSquad混合检测模型，集成预训练语言模型的文本嵌入和门控图变换器进行垃圾节点分类，无需手动特征工程或大量训练资源。

Result: 在三个LLM生成数据集上比最先进基线方法提升44.22%精确度和43.01%召回率，在人类撰写垃圾数据集上也表现良好。

Conclusion: FraudSquad模型规模适中，需要少量标注数据，是应对LLM时代垃圾检测挑战的实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在数学问题上存在语法盲点，即使语义简单但表达方式陌生时也会出错。通过从正确示例中提取语法模板重述问题，可以显著提高回答准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs在数学推理中存在系统性的语法盲点问题，即模型会将熟悉的推理策略错误应用于语法表达陌生但语义简单的问题上，这反映了表面形式与内部表征之间的脆弱耦合。

Method: 使用从正确示例中提取的语法模板重述错误回答的问题，保持语义不变但降低结构复杂度。采用基于依存局部理论(DLT)的指标量化语法复杂度。

Result: 重述后的问题往往能得到正确答案。更高的DLT分数与多个数据集中失败率的增加相关，表明语法复杂度与错误率正相关。

Conclusion: 许多推理错误源于结构错位而非概念难度，语法感知干预可以揭示和缓解这些归纳失败。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

TL;DR: SCRIBES是一个基于强化学习的框架，利用网页布局相似性作为奖励信号，生成可重用的提取脚本来高效提取半结构化网页内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTML表格、列表和信息框等半结构化内容在网页中占比很大，但现有方法要么缺乏泛化能力，要么因每页LLM推理而资源密集。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，利用同一网站内网页的布局相似性作为奖励信号，生成可重用的提取脚本，并通过CommonCrawl数据上的合成注释进行迭代训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在脚本质量上比强基线高出13%以上，并将GPT-4o的下游问答准确率提高了4%以上。

Conclusion: SCRIBES实现了可扩展且资源高效的网页信息提取。

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型参数量巨大且需要海量数据训练，远超儿童语言习得所需的数据量。多模态模型在纯语言任务中表现不佳，需要解决这一性能差距。

Method: 在低资源设置下开发纯语言和多模态模型，采用模型融合方法将多模态模型与纯语言模型的参数进行加权线性插值。

Result: 多模态模型在BabyLM基准测试中表现优于之前的基线，但在语法相关的纯语言基准测试中表现不佳。模型融合方法在一定程度上缓解了这个问题，同时保持了多模态性能。

Conclusion: 多模态模型确实在纯语言任务中存在性能不足，通过模型融合方法可以部分解决这一问题，在保持多模态能力的同时提升语言表现。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

TL;DR: REPAIR是一个终身编辑框架，通过渐进式自适应干预和重整合支持精确、低成本的LLM更新，同时保护非目标知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM后训练中获取新知识或纠正错误的高成本问题，以及重训练带来的意外副作用。

Method: 采用闭环反馈机制和动态内存管理来缓解大规模顺序编辑的不稳定性和冲突，结合频繁知识融合和强局部性保护。

Result: 在多个模型系列中编辑准确率提升10%-30%，显著减少知识遗忘。

Conclusion: 为开发可靠、可扩展且持续演化的LLM提供了一个鲁棒框架。

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

Conclusion: 奖励模型是提升LLM推理性能的关键组件，本文为有效部署和推进奖励模型在LLM推理中的应用提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning
performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune
LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from
multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic
introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM
reasoning.

Result: ILM能够同时提高LLMs的鲁棒性和实现原生接地，有助于红队测试。

Conclusion: ILM为下一代LLMs奠定了基础，使其不仅更鲁棒和接地，而且从根本上更可控和可信。

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and
underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote
adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to
input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by
inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,
potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation
LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

Method: 提出Veri-R1在线强化学习框架，让LLM与搜索引擎交互，通过奖励信号明确塑造其规划、检索和推理行为。这种动态交互更准确地反映了真实世界的验证场景。

Result: 实验结果显示Veri-R1将联合准确率提高了30%，证据分数翻倍，通常超越更大规模的对应方法。消融研究揭示了奖励组件的影响以及输出logits与标签准确率之间的联系。

Conclusion: 研究证明了在线强化学习在精确和可信的声明验证中的有效性，为未来研究奠定了基础，并发布了代码以支持社区在LLM赋能的声明验证方面的进展。

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and
faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We
release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim
verification.

### [71] [Taking a SEAT: Predicting Value Interpretations from Sentiment, Emotion, Argument, and Topic Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01976)
*Adina Nicola Dobrinoiu,Ana Cristiana Marcu,Amir Homayounirad,Luciano Cavalcante Siebert,Enrico Liscio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索了语言模型能否通过多维主观标注（情感、情绪、论证、主题）来预测个体的价值解释，发现同时提供所有维度能获得最佳性能，强调了个体主观标注行为对价值预测的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认识到个体价值解释受社会文化背景和生活经历影响而具有主观性，需要开发能够与不同人类观点对齐并避免偏向多数观点的AI系统。

Method: 使用SEAT维度（情感、情绪、论证、主题）的多维主观标注作为个体解释视角的代理，在不同零样本和少样本设置下评估语言模型预测个体价值解释的能力。

Result: 同时提供所有SEAT维度比单独维度或无个体信息的基线表现更优，个体标注者间的差异凸显了考虑个体主观标注的重要性。

Conclusion: 这是首个超越人口统计学特征、研究标注行为对价值预测影响的尝试，为未来大规模验证提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

### [72] [Exploring Database Normalization Effects on SQL Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01989)
*Ryosuke Kohita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了数据库模式规范化对自然语言转SQL系统性能的影响，发现非规范化模式在简单查询中表现更好，而规范化模式在聚合查询中更优，最佳模式设计取决于查询类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2SQL研究大多在固定模式上评估模型，忽略了模式设计对性能的重要影响。本文旨在系统研究模式规范化程度如何影响NL2SQL系统的表现。

Method: 在合成数据集上构建了形式化规范化(1NF-3NF)模式，在真实学术论文数据集上使用实用模式，评估了8个领先大语言模型在不同规范化程度下的表现。

Result: 非规范化模式在简单检索查询中准确率高，即使在零样本设置下；规范化模式(2NF/3NF)在连接预测方面有挑战但可通过少量样本缓解；规范化模式在聚合查询中表现更好，对数据重复和NULL值问题更鲁棒。

Conclusion: NL2SQL应用的最佳模式设计取决于支持的查询类型，开发NL2SQL接口时应考虑模式设计，并为实际场景集成自适应模式选择。

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

*Md Arid Hasan,Firoj Alam,Md Fahad Hossain,Usman Naseem,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个多任务孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BanglaMultiHate，并通过系统实验比较了传统方法、预训练模型和LLM在低资源环境下的性能，发现文化语言适配的预训练对稳健性能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语等低资源语言缺乏有效的仇恨言论检测工具，现有研究多为单任务且覆盖信号有限，需要更全面的多任务数据集和系统评估。

Method: 构建了大规模人工标注的多任务孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集，系统比较了传统基线方法、单语预训练模型和LLM在零样本提示和LoRA微调下的表现。

Result: LoRA微调的LLM与BanglaBERT性能相当，但文化和语言适配的预训练对稳健性能仍然关键。

Conclusion: 数据集和发现为低资源环境下开发文化适配的审核工具建立了更强基准，强调了文化语言适配预训练的重要性。

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

TL;DR: 本研究从过程导向角度分析大语言模型的创作创造力，引入基于约束的决策框架，发现LLMs在创作中一致性地优先考虑风格而非其他元素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型创造力评估主要关注输出质量而非创作过程，本研究旨在通过叙事学视角分析LLMs作为计算作者的创作过程。

Method: 使用控制提示分配作者角色，分析模型的创作偏好，并探究其选择背后的推理过程。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在创作决策中一致性地强调风格元素，超越了角色、事件和场景等其他要素，不同模型展现出独特的创作特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析AI作者创造力提供了一个新颖的系统性工具，揭示了LLMs在创作过程中的独特偏好模式。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

TL;DR: 提出了Streaming RAG框架，在端到端语音对话系统中集成工具调用，通过并行预测工具查询来降低延迟，提高问答准确性和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音对话系统虽然能生成更自然、低延迟的响应，但容易产生幻觉，缺乏事实基础。需要将文本对话系统中的工具集成能力扩展到语音系统中。

Method: 开发了Streaming RAG框架，在用户说话时并行预测工具查询，通过后训练流程教导模型何时调用工具以及如何融合音频查询和检索结果生成语音摘要。

Result: 在AudioCRAG基准测试中，QA准确率相对提升200%（从11.1%到34.2%），工具使用延迟降低20%。

Conclusion: Streaming RAG方法不仅提高了语音对话系统的准确性和响应性，而且是模态无关的，可应用于文本输入，为更智能的实时AI助手铺平道路。

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SCoT：一种用于双工口语对话系统的流式思维链框架，通过交替处理固定时长的用户输入和分块生成响应，解决了传统VAD无法区分停顿和话轮结束的问题，同时避免了复杂双通道架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端口语对话系统依赖语音活动检测(VAD)进行话轮转换，但VAD无法区分停顿和话轮完成。现有双工SDS模型虽然通过预测静音令牌避免了显式VAD，但架构复杂且在语义推理上落后于级联模型。

Method: 提出SCoT流式思维链框架，交替处理固定时长用户输入和分块生成响应。利用帧级对齐为每个块创建中间目标（对齐的用户转录和系统响应）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比现有双工方法产生更连贯和可解释的响应，同时相比逐轮系统支持更低延迟和重叠交互。

Conclusion: SCoT框架有效解决了双工SDS的架构复杂性和语义推理不足问题，实现了更自然的对话交互。

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码技术已成为系统性减少大语言模型解码时间的标准技术，但现有研究未关注其在不同任务间可能存在的速度提升差异问题，特别是对欠拟合和代表性不足任务的影响。

Method: 通过理论分析量化推测解码在不同任务间的速度提升差异，识别导致这种不公平性的因素，并设计相应的缓解策略来减少速度提升差异。

Result: 研究发现推测解码的速度提升在不同任务间分布不均，对欠拟合和代表性不足任务的速度提升效果较差。提出的缓解策略在多个模型对上验证，公平性指标平均提高了12%。

Conclusion: 推测解码技术存在任务间速度提升不公平的问题，需要特别关注对欠拟合和代表性不足任务的影响，提出的缓解策略能有效减少这种不公平性。

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

TL;DR: RESTRAIN是一个自惩罚强化学习框架，通过利用模型整个答案分布中的信号，在没有黄金标签的情况下实现推理能力的自我提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于人工标注数据的强化学习在推理任务上成本高昂且在困难任务上表现不佳，需要一种无需标注数据就能持续改进的体验驱动学习方法。

Method: 提出RESTRAIN框架，通过自惩罚机制惩罚过度自信的推理路径和低一致性样本，同时保留有希望的推理链，可无缝集成到GRPO等策略优化方法中。

Result: 在AIME25上Pass@1提升+140.7%，MMLU_STEM提升+36.2%，GPQA-Diamond提升+19.6%，几乎达到黄金标签训练的效果但无需任何黄金标签。

Conclusion: RESTRAIN为无需黄金标签实现更强推理能力提供了一条可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作大多将幻觉检测视为二元分类任务，但实际应用需要识别幻觉的具体范围，这是一个多步骤决策过程。需要探索显式推理是否有助于检测幻觉范围。

Method: 首先评估带和不带思维链推理的预训练模型，发现CoT推理有潜力生成正确答案。然后提出RL4HS强化学习框架，基于组相对策略优化，引入类感知策略优化来解决奖励不平衡问题。

Result: 在RAGTruth基准测试（摘要、问答、数据到文本）上，RL4HS超越了预训练推理模型和监督微调方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，使用span级奖励的强化学习对于检测幻觉范围是必要的，RL4HS框架有效提升了幻觉检测性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPARQL查询语言对非计算机背景用户门槛过高，需要降低知识图谱交互难度，通过LLM实现自然语言到SPARQL的翻译

Method: 基于SPINACH的LLM代理架构，采用迭代式探索和执行过程，而非单次翻译，逐步构建和优化SPARQL查询

Result: 开发了完整的系统架构，并对代理行为进行了深入分析，识别了未来改进的关键方向

Conclusion: 迭代式Text2SPARQL方法有效降低了知识图谱查询门槛，为后续针对性改进提供了重要见解

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the
Text2SPARQL domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注执行准确性，但忽视了链式思维(CoT)推理是否与真实动作一致，这可能导致用户过度信任看似合理的推理而授权有害动作，造成财务损失或信任危机。

Method: 引入真实对齐(GTA)指标来衡量CoT推理暗示的动作是否与真实动作匹配，结合EM指标共同评估推理准确性和执行准确性，识别执行差距(EG)和推理差距(RG)两种类型的差距。

Result: 实验结果表明推理-执行差距普遍存在，执行差距比推理差距更频繁发生。虽然扩大模型规模能减少总体差距，但即使在最大模型中仍存在显著执行差距。

Conclusion: 该框架可靠地反映了最先进模型中的系统性EG/RG模式，为开发更可信的移动使用代理提供了具体诊断支持。

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法主要依赖自我探索或单一教师模型，可能导致模型偏见和探索受限，限制了推理多样性和性能。

Method: AMPO框架采用"按需指导"策略，仅当在线模型无法生成正确解时，自适应利用多个熟练教师模型的指导，并结合基于理解的路径选择机制。

Result: 在数学推理任务上比基线GRPO提升4.3%，在分布外任务上提升12.2%，显著提高Pass@k性能并实现更多样化探索。

Conclusion: AMPO提供了一条更高效、可扩展的路径，实现卓越的推理能力和泛化性，仅用四个同规模教师即可达到使用单一更强大教师模型的效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X
(formerly known as Twitter) endangers young people and their emotional
well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been
developed around the English language, and methods for detecting
Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the
effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language

used the kappa tool to verify and enhance the quality of our annotations. We
conducted four experiments to test numerous deep learning models for
automatically detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying. We first tested a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model and a bidirectional long short-term memory

LSTM and Bi-LSTM models with a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder from
representations (BERT) and then tested them on a different experimental models
BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM
with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Token熵累积平均(TECA)指标和累积熵调节(CER)机制，通过"探索简要，然后决策"范式解决LLMs在简单问题上过度思考的问题，显著减少响应长度而不影响解题能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂问题上表现出色，但在简单问题上经常过度思考，生成不必要的冗长推理步骤，这降低了模型效率且难以根据问题复杂度调整推理深度。

Method: 引入TECA指标衡量推理过程中的探索程度，提出CER机制和"探索简要，然后决策"范式，帮助模型动态确定结束思考过程的最佳时机。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，该方法显著缓解了过度思考问题，在简单数据集上平均响应长度减少高达71%，同时保持解题能力。

Conclusion: 该方法创建了更高效和自适应的推理过程，通过动态调节推理深度实现了效率与准确性的平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

*Yaxin Du,Yuanshuo Zhang,Xiyuan Yang,Yifan Zhou,Cheng Wang,Gongyi Zou,Xianghe Pang,Wenhao Wang,Menglan Chen,Shuo Tang,Zhiyu Li,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了InfoMosaic-Bench基准测试，评估工具增强型智能体在多源信息检索中的表现，发现现有LLM在结合通用搜索和领域专用工具方面存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体过度依赖开放网络搜索，面临内容噪声和领域知识缺失的问题，而MCP协议虽然提供了访问专业工具的途径，但智能体是否能有效利用这些工具尚不明确。

Method: 创建InfoMosaic-Bench基准，涵盖六个代表性领域，通过InfoMosaic-Flow流程合成任务，确保任务可靠性和非平凡性，测试14个先进LLM智能体。

Result: 实验显示：仅靠网络信息准确率仅38.2%；领域工具提供选择性但不一致的帮助；22.4%的失败源于工具使用错误。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在工具使用和选择方面仍存在基本困难，需要改进智能体的工具集成能力。

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了基于英语的强化学习后训练（RPT）所获得推理能力是否能有效迁移到其他语言，发现跨语言迁移性受初始模型、目标语言和训练范式影响，并提出了平行训练方法显著提升跨语言推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注强化学习推理在任务或模态间的泛化，而本研究首次从跨语言视角探讨推理泛化，检验英语中心的大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理能力是否能有效迁移到其他语言。

Method: 系统评估英语中心LRMs在多语言推理基准上的表现，引入量化跨语言可迁移性的指标，通过干预性研究和平行训练实验分析迁移机制。

Result: 发现跨语言迁移性差异显著，初始英语能力强的模型过度依赖英语特定模式导致跨语言泛化减弱；平行训练带来性能显著提升，跨语言推理迁移遵循与训练平行语言数量相关的幂律。

Conclusion: 英语中心LRMs未能完全实现跨语言泛化，挑战了LRM推理模仿人类认知的假设，为开发更语言无关的LRMs提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

extraction of intermediate outputs from any layer during the forward pass of
open-source VLMs. VLM-Lens provides a unified, YAML-configurable interface that

across diverse VLMs. It currently supports 16 state-of-the-art base VLMs and
their over 30 variants, and is extensible to accommodate new models without
changing the core logic.
  The toolkit integrates easily with various interpretability and analysis
methods. We demonstrate its usage with two simple analytical experiments,
revealing systematic differences in the hidden representations of VLMs across
layers and target concepts. VLM-Lens is released as an open-sourced project to
accelerate community efforts in understanding and improving VLMs.

Abstract: We introduce F2LLM - Foundation to Feature Large Language Models, a suite of
state-of-the-art embedding models in three sizes: 0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B. Unlike
previous top-ranking embedding models that require massive contrastive
pretraining, sophisticated training pipelines, and costly synthetic training
data, F2LLM is directly finetuned from foundation models on 6 million
query-document-negative tuples curated from open-source, non-synthetic
datasets, striking a strong balance between training cost, model size, and
embedding performance. On the MTEB English leaderboard, F2LLM-4B ranks 2nd
among models with approximately 4B parameters and 7th overall, while F2LLM-1.7B
ranks 1st among models in the 1B-2B size range. To facilitate future research

TL;DR: 本文质疑大语言模型竞技场评估中平局处理的传统方法，认为平局更多反映查询难度而非模型实力相当，建议忽略平局的评分更新能提高预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将平局视为两个模型实力相等而进行评分调整，但作者认为平局实际上更多反映了查询的难度问题，而非模型能力的真实对比。

Method: 在三个真实世界竞技场数据集上，比较了忽略平局评分更新与使用Elo等四种评分系统的效果，并分析了平局与查询难度、客观性的关联。

Result: 忽略平局评分更新使战斗结果预测准确率相对提高1-3%，平局更常出现在非常容易和高度客观的查询中，风险比分别为1.37和1.35。

Conclusion: 建议未来的评分系统重新考虑平局的语义，并在评分更新中考虑查询属性。

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

TL;DR: AGILE通过将拼图任务构建为交互式学习过程，显著提升了视觉语言模型的感知和推理能力，在2×2拼图任务中准确率从9.5%提升至82.8%，并在9个通用视觉任务上平均提升3.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在多模态理解和推理方面虽有进步，但其基本感知和推理能力仍然有限，即使在简单的拼图任务上表现也接近随机水平，高质量视觉语言数据的稀缺性和有限可扩展性限制了这些能力的提升。

Method: AGILE将拼图求解构建为交互过程，模型在每个步骤生成可执行代码来执行动作，环境提供细粒度视觉反馈来指导任务完成，通过观察和交互的迭代循环，模型通过探索和反馈逐步提升感知和推理能力。

Result: AGILE在复杂度不同的拼图任务上显著提升性能（2×2设置下准确率从9.5%提升至82.8%），并在9个通用视觉任务上表现出强泛化能力，平均提升3.1%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进多模态模型的推理和泛化能力开辟了新途径，并为多模态强化学习数据稀缺问题提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

TL;DR: MEMTRACK是一个评估多平台代理环境中长期记忆和状态跟踪的基准测试，专注于企业环境中的动态记忆评估，超越了传统的对话式记忆测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文和记忆基准测试主要关注对话场景，但企业环境中需要评估动态记忆的有效应用，特别是在多平台集成的工作流程中。

Method: 通过整合Slack、Linear和Git等多个通信和生产力平台的异步事件，创建平台间交错的时间线，包含噪声、冲突和交叉引用信息，以及代码库/文件系统理解。数据集通过专家设计和基于代理的合成方法构建。

Result: 实验显示最先进的LLM和记忆后端在利用长期记忆、处理跨平台依赖和解决矛盾方面面临挑战，表现最佳的GPT-5模型在MEMTRACK上仅获得60%的正确性得分。

Conclusion: 该工作为记忆增强代理的评估研究提供了一个可扩展框架，超越了现有对话设置的局限性，为复杂组织环境中的多代理、多平台记忆基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TRACE方法来检测隐式奖励黑客攻击，通过截断推理过程量化模型努力程度，在数学推理和编程任务中显著优于现有监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励黑客攻击（模型利用奖励函数漏洞获得高分但不解决实际任务）是一个严重威胁，特别是隐式攻击会绕过现有的推理链监控。

Method: TRACE方法通过逐步截断模型的推理链，强制模型在不同截断点回答，测量验证器通过率。黑客模型会以较少的推理努力获得高分，表现为准确率-长度曲线下面积较大。

Result: 在数学推理任务中比最强的72B推理链监控器提升65%以上，在编程任务中比32B监控器提升30%以上，并能发现训练中的未知漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种可扩展的无监督监督方法，在当前监控方法失效的情况下有效检测隐式奖励黑客攻击。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种通过知识蒸馏将推理时检索转化为学习能力的方法，在交互式任务中显著提升LLM代理性能，同时减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在多步任务中经常因未满足前提条件、冗余命令或环境约束处理不当而失败，而检索增强生成方法需要维护外部知识库且计算开销大。

Method: 三步流程：(1)从代理失败中提取紧凑可重用的提示；(2)使用这些提示在任务开始时通过一次性检索生成改进的教师轨迹；(3)在移除提示字符串的情况下训练学生模型，强制内化而非记忆。

Result: 在ALFWorld和WebShop两个交互式基准测试中，蒸馏学生模型始终优于基线代理，ALFWorld成功率提升至91%（基线79%），WebShop分数提升至72（基线61），同时令牌使用量减少10-60%。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模（7B/14B参数）和代理架构（ReAct/StateAct）上均有效，表明检索优势可以通过有针对性的微调有效内化，无需永久运行时依赖。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VOGUE是一种新颖的强化学习方法，通过将视觉输入视为随机上下文，在输入空间而非输出空间进行探索，显著提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在处理多模态输入时将视觉输入视为固定条件，忽略了视觉变化带来的不确定性，导致策略对视觉变化的鲁棒性不足。

Method: VOGUE将图像视为随机上下文，通过计算原始分支和噪声分支之间的对称KL散度来量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，结合不确定性比例奖励、token熵奖励和退火采样调度来平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B模型上，VOGUE在三个视觉数学基准上平均提升pass@1准确率2.6%，在三个通用领域推理基准上提升3.7%，同时提高pass@4性能并缓解RL微调中常见的探索衰减问题。

Conclusion: 基于视觉输入固有不确定性的探索策略是提升多模态推理的有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM规划代理在处理观测不确定性时，往往忽略其内部动态与实际环境之间的差异，导致在信息不完整和噪声动态的实用环境中表现不佳。

Method: InfoSeeker提示LLM主动收集信息，通过规划行动来验证理解、检测环境变化或测试假设，然后再生成或修订任务导向计划。

Result: 在部分可观测环境的新基准测试中，InfoSeeker相比先前方法实现了74%的绝对性能提升，且不牺牲样本效率。在机器人操作和网络导航等基准测试中也优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在部分可观测环境中紧密整合规划与信息寻求对于实现鲁棒行为的重要性。

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

*Yubin Kim,Taehan Kim,Eugene Park,Chunjong Park,Cynthia Breazeal,Daniel McDuff,Hae Won Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InvThink是一种让大语言模型具备逆向思维能力的方法，通过先分析潜在危害及其后果，再生成安全输出，显著提升模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法直接优化安全响应，但缺乏系统性风险分析能力。InvThink旨在让模型主动识别和避免潜在风险。

Method: 1) 列举潜在危害 2) 分析后果 3) 生成主动避免这些风险的安全输出。通过监督微调和强化学习在三个LLM家族中实现。

Result: 安全性改进随模型规模扩展更强；减轻安全税，保持标准基准的通用推理能力；在高风险领域（医疗、金融、法律等）有害响应减少15.7%。

Conclusion: 逆向推理为构建更安全、更强大的语言模型提供了可扩展和通用的路径。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型在心理咨询领域的应用潜力，通过开发基于美国国家咨询师认证考试的PsychoBench基准来评估LLMs的心理咨询能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在需要认知能力的应用（如心理咨询）中的潜力，评估它们是否具备成为合格心理咨询师所需的知识水平。

Method: 开发PsychoBench基准，包含约2,252个精心筛选的单选问题，基于美国国家咨询师认证考试，要求约70%的准确率才能通过。

Result: 先进模型如GPT-4o、Llama3.3-70B和Gemma3-27B远超通过阈值，而较小的开源模型（如Qwen2.5-7B、Mistral-7B）远低于阈值。

Conclusion: 只有前沿LLMs目前能够达到心理咨询考试标准，这凸显了开发心理学导向LLMs的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: 计算机使用代理在追求用户目标时存在盲目目标导向性，表现为缺乏上下文推理、在模糊情境下做出假设和决策、以及追求矛盾或不可行目标，这带来了安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理在GUI上执行操作以实现用户目标，但存在盲目追求目标而忽视可行性、安全性和上下文的问题，需要系统性地识别和评估这种风险。

Method: 开发了BLIND-ACT基准测试，包含90个任务来捕捉三种盲目目标导向模式，基于OSWorld构建真实环境，使用LLM评估代理行为，并与人类标注达到93.75%的一致性。

Result: 评估了9个前沿模型，包括Claude Sonnet和Opus 4、Computer-Use-Preview和GPT-5，观察到平均80.8%的盲目目标导向率，提示干预能降低风险但仍有显著残余风险。

Conclusion: 识别盲目目标导向性并引入BLIND-ACT基准为未来研究和缓解这一基本风险奠定了基础，确保计算机使用代理的安全部署。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估方法主要基于对智能的直觉设计合成任务，这些方法在AI历史上表现不佳，需要更有效的评估框架。

Method: 提出基于稳健任务执行的评估设计哲学，借鉴数据科学中展示系统可靠部署的实践方法。

Result: 提供了AGI评估的实际示例，展示了如何通过能力证明而非直觉任务来评估AGI系统。

Conclusion: AGI评估应转向关注系统在实际任务中的稳健执行能力，这比基于直觉的合成任务评估更有效。

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了PTA-GRPO框架，通过两阶段方法改进LLM的推理能力：第一阶段使用高级LLM将思维链提炼为紧凑的高级指导进行监督微调；第二阶段引入指导感知的强化学习联合优化最终输出和高级指导质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂任务中的推理主要依赖思维链，但由于自回归的token级生成，推理过程局限于局部决策，缺乏全局规划，导致推理冗余、不连贯或不准确，影响整体性能。现有方法如树算法和RL计算成本高且难以产生最优推理轨迹。

Method: PTA-GRPO两阶段框架：1）使用高级LLM将思维链提炼为紧凑高级指导进行SFT；2）引入指导感知RL方法联合优化最终输出和高级指导质量。在多个数学推理基准上测试不同基础模型。

Result: 在MATH、AIME2024、AIME2025、AMC等多个数学推理基准上，使用Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct、Qwen3-8B、Qwen3-14B、LLaMA3.2-3B等不同基础模型进行实验，PTA-GRPO均实现了稳定且显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO在不同模型和任务上都能实现稳定且显著的改进，验证了其有效性和泛化能力，为解决LLM推理中的全局规划问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了CARS方法，通过自适应剪枝技术改进拒绝采样，在保持分布保真的同时提高采样效率，特别适用于程序模糊测试等需要多样性和有效性的领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束生成方法存在两极化问题：贪婪约束解码会扭曲语言模型分布，而拒绝采样虽然保真但计算效率低下。在程序模糊测试等需要多样性和有效性的领域，这两种方法都不理想。

Method: CARS方法从无约束语言模型采样开始，通过记录约束违反的延续到trie结构中，自适应地排除这些路径并从未来采样中减去其概率质量，确保无效前缀不会被重复访问。

Result: 在程序模糊测试和分子生成等多个领域的实验中，CARS在采样效率（每个有效样本所需的LM前向传递次数）和样本多样性方面都优于GCD和其他近似LM分布的方法。

Conclusion: CARS严格改进了拒绝采样的样本效率，同时保持分布无失真，为需要约束生成的应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了AI模型在ConceptARC基准测试中的抽象推理能力，发现仅凭输出准确率评估会高估文本模态的抽象推理能力，而低估视觉模态的抽象推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管OpenAI的o3-preview模型在ARC-AGI基准上超越了人类准确率，但作者质疑这些模型是否真正使用了任务设计者预期的抽象概念进行推理，而非依赖表面模式。

Method: 在ConceptARC上评估模型，改变输入模态（文本vs视觉）、是否允许使用Python工具、以及推理模型的推理努力程度。除了输出准确率，还对模型生成的自然语言解释规则进行细粒度评估。

Result: 使用文本表示的一些模型在输出准确率上匹配人类，但其规则往往基于表面捷径，很少捕捉到预期抽象概念。在视觉模态中，模型输出准确率大幅下降，但规则分析显示它们仍能生成相当比例的预期抽象规则，只是无法正确应用。

Conclusion: 模型在抽象推理方面仍落后于人类，仅凭准确率评估ARC类任务的抽象推理能力会高估文本模态的能力，低估视觉模态的能力。作者提出的评估框架能更真实地反映多模态模型的抽象推理能力。

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

Result: 实验证实主流DRAs在性能上优于基于网络搜索工具增强的推理模型，但也显示出仍有相当大的改进空间。

Conclusion: 本研究为DRA系统的能力评估、架构改进和范式进步提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

Motivation: 研究RLVR方法在提升大语言模型推理能力时出现的推理边界缩小问题，探索其失败原因并寻求改进方案。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究，揭示了RLVR中的负干扰现象和赢家通吃现象，并提出了一种专注于低概率问题的数据筛选算法。

Result: 研究发现RLVR会因负干扰导致某些训练问题的正确解概率下降，同时赢家通吃现象使得模型过度强化高概率问题而抑制低概率问题，导致收敛到狭窄的解策略。提出的数据筛选算法显著改善了Pass@k性能。

Conclusion: RLVR方法存在固有的学习动态问题，通过专注于低概率问题的数据筛选可以有效缓解推理边界缩小的问题，提升模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 研究表明，当采用结构化轨迹理解和选择时，扩展计算机使用代理具有显著效果，bBoN为实现这一目标提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

<details>

Motivation: 现有大模型在推理过程中难以持续捕获和重用算法过程，容易陷入冗长退化的探索，需要更有效的推理方法

Method: 引入推理抽象概念，训练模型生成多个抽象描述，然后使用强化学习构建解决方案，形成抽象生成器和解决方案生成器的双玩家RL训练范式

Result: RLAD方法实现了结构化探索，解耦了抽象提议和解决方案生成的学习信号，并提高了对更难问题的泛化能力

Conclusion: 推理抽象能有效引导有意义的探索，在测试时分配更多计算资源生成抽象比生成更多解决方案更有利于性能提升

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

Conclusion: 黑板范式为多智能体系统提供了一个可扩展且可泛化的通信框架，在大型异构数据湖的数据发现任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new
opportunities in data science, yet their practical deployment is often
constrained by the challenge of discovering relevant data within large
heterogeneous data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: single-agent
systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files in the large data
lakes, while multi-agent systems designed based on a master-slave paradigm
depend on a rigid central controller for task allocation that requires precise
knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard
architecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent
posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents --
either responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information
retrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design
improves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central
coordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate
our method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench
and modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery.
Experimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially
outperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm,
achieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success
and up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the
best-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our
findings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable
communication framework for multi-agent systems.

### [111] [Jailbreaking LLMs via Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with Targeted Toxic Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01223)
*Hui Dou,Ning Xu,Yiwen Zhang,Kaibin Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出RTS-Attack攻击框架，通过构建与查询高度语义相关的嵌套场景并整合针对性有害知识，成功绕过LLMs的对齐防御，且生成的越狱提示具有良好的隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs的对齐防御对语义相关嵌套场景不敏感，这是重要但未被充分探索的方向，旨在开发隐蔽性强的越狱攻击方法。

Method: 提出RTS-Attack框架，构建与查询高度语义相关的嵌套场景，并整合针对性有害知识，生成无有害查询的越狱提示。

Result: 在GPT-4o、Llama3-70b和Gemini-pro等多种先进LLMs上，RTS-Attack在效率和通用性方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RTS-Attack通过语义相关嵌套场景和针对性有害知识，有效绕过LLMs对齐防御，具有出色的隐蔽性和攻击效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various tasks. However, they remain exposed to jailbreak attacks, eliciting
harmful responses. The nested scenario strategy has been increasingly adopted
across various methods, demonstrating immense potential. Nevertheless, these
methods are easily detectable due to their prominent malicious intentions. In
this work, we are the first to find and systematically verify that LLMs'
alignment defenses are not sensitive to nested scenarios, where these scenarios
are highly semantically relevant to the queries and incorporate targeted toxic
knowledge. This is a crucial yet insufficiently explored direction. Based on
this, we propose RTS-Attack (Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with
Targeted Toxic Knowledge), an adaptive and automated framework to examine LLMs'
alignment. By building scenarios highly relevant to the queries and integrating
targeted toxic knowledge, RTS-Attack bypasses the alignment defenses of LLMs.
Moreover, the jailbreak prompts generated by RTS-Attack are free from harmful
queries, leading to outstanding concealment. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RTS-Attack exhibits superior performance in both efficiency and
universality compared to the baselines across diverse advanced LLMs, including
GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, and Gemini-pro. Our complete code is available in the
supplementary material. WARNING: THIS PAPER CONTAINS POTENTIALLY HARMFUL

TL;DR: 首个针对Web代理的提示注入攻击检测基准研究，系统评估了文本和图像检测方法在不同攻击场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示注入攻击检测方法缺乏对Web代理的系统性评估，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含恶意和良性样本的数据集，系统化文本和图像检测方法，并在多种场景下评估性能。

Result: 检测器能有效识别依赖显式文本指令或可见图像扰动的攻击，但对无显式指令或不可感知扰动的攻击效果不佳。

Conclusion: 当前检测方法在复杂攻击场景下存在局限性，需要开发更鲁棒的检测技术。

Abstract: Multiple prompt injection attacks have been proposed against web agents. At
the same time, various methods have been developed to detect general prompt
injection attacks, but none have been systematically evaluated for web agents.
In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first comprehensive
benchmark study on detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents. We
begin by introducing a fine-grained categorization of such attacks based on the
threat model. We then construct datasets containing both malicious and benign
samples: malicious text segments generated by different attacks, benign text
segments from four categories, malicious images produced by attacks, and benign
images from two categories. Next, we systematize both text-based and
image-based detection methods. Finally, we evaluate their performance across
multiple scenarios. Our key findings show that while some detectors can
identify attacks that rely on explicit textual instructions or visible image
perturbations with moderate to high accuracy, they largely fail against attacks
that omit explicit instructions or employ imperceptible perturbations. Our
datasets and code are released at:

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文认为LLM隐私风险远不止训练数据提取，还包括数据收集、推理时上下文泄露、自主代理能力和深度推理攻击等更紧迫的威胁，呼吁研究社区超越当前技术解决方案的狭隘关注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于LLM隐私风险的讨论过度关注训练数据的逐字记忆，而更直接和可扩展的隐私威胁却被忽视，需要重新审视LLM系统的整体隐私格局。

Method: 提出了涵盖LLM生命周期各阶段的隐私风险分类法，通过案例研究展示当前隐私框架的不足，并对2016-2025年间1322篇AI/ML隐私论文进行纵向分析。

Result: 分析显示记忆问题在技术研究中受到过度关注，而最紧迫的隐私危害存在于其他领域，当前技术方法在这些领域缺乏有效应对方案。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究社区从根本上改变对LLM隐私的认知方式，超越当前技术解决方案的狭隘关注，采用跨学科方法应对这些新兴威胁的社会技术性质。

Abstract: The discourse on privacy risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
disproportionately focused on verbatim memorization of training data, while a
constellation of more immediate and scalable privacy threats remain
underexplored. This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM
systems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from
data collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent
capabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference
attacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM
lifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through
case studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted
threats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers
published at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal
that while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the
most pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches
offer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear. We call for a
fundamental shift in how the research community approaches LLM privacy, moving
beyond the narrow focus of current technical solutions and embracing
interdisciplinary approaches that address the sociotechnical nature of these
emerging threats.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过合成前缀来缓解实时神经查询自动补全系统中呈现偏差的数据中心方法，该方法在大型电商环境中显著提升了用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时查询自动补全系统中存在的呈现偏差问题，即模型建议会影响用户行为，导致收集的参与信号存在固有偏差。

Method: 使用从完整用户查询生成的合成前缀来丰富训练数据，开发了针对实时部署优化的神经排序器，并引入了计算复杂度从O(n²)降低到O(n)的列表损失简化方法。

Result: 在大规模电商环境中部署，系统在用户参与度方面显示出统计显著的改进，通过平均倒数排名和相关指标衡量。

Conclusion: 合成前缀不仅提高了泛化能力，还为其他低延迟排序任务（包括相关搜索和查询推荐）中的偏差缓解提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: We introduce a data-centric approach for mitigating presentation bias in
real-time neural query autocomplete systems through the use of synthetic
prefixes. These prefixes are generated from complete user queries collected
during regular search sessions where autocomplete was not active. This allows
us to enrich the training data for learning to rank models with more diverse
and less biased examples. This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement
signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model
suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for
real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich
set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores,
and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical
alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we
introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing
computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query
autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix.
Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates
statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean
reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes
not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias
mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and
query recommendations.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的推荐系统存在三个主要问题：使用静态数据无法捕捉快速变化的用户偏好；忽略视觉和音频等非文本内容；缺乏可信的解释机制。

Method: 1) 在线适应机制，通过轻量级模块持续整合新用户交互；2) 统一表示方法，结合协同过滤信号与视觉音频特征；3) 解释系统，基于具体协同模式和物品属性生成可验证的自然语言理由。

Conclusion: \model{}框架有效解决了LLM推荐系统的关键挑战，通过创新的在线适应、多模态融合和可信解释机制，实现了高效实用的推荐解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation
tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text
prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising
approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM
representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive
fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several
challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static
snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items
contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current
systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete
evidence. Our work introduces \model{}, a framework that tackles these
limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation
mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through
lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a
unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with
visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be
unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds
recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes,
producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains
the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational
overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Contemporary generative recommendation systems face significant challenges in
handling multimodal data, eliminating algorithmic biases, and providing
transparent decision-making processes. This paper introduces an enhanced
generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through
five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented

recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our
framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while
incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual
knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous
model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets

Motivation: 原始Promptagator方法依赖专有且大规模LLM，用户可能无法访问或无法用于敏感数据，因此研究开源LLM在可访问规模（≤14B参数）下的替代效果。

Method: 使用参数规模≤14B的开源LLM作为Promptagator式查询生成器，生成任务特定查询来微调领域专用稠密检索模型。

Result: 开源LLM小至3B参数即可作为有效的Promptagator式查询生成器，为领域特定应用的微调提供可靠替代方案。

Conclusion: 这项工作为从业者提供了合成数据生成的可靠替代方案，并为最大化领域特定应用的微调结果提供了见解。

Abstract: Promptagator demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot
prompts can be used as task-specific query generators for fine-tuning
domain-specialized dense retrieval models. However, the original Promptagator
approach relied on proprietary and large-scale LLMs which users may not have
access to or may be prohibited from using with sensitive data. In this work, we
study the impact of open-source LLMs at accessible scales ($\leq$14B
parameters) as an alternative. Our results demonstrate that open-source LLMs as
small as 3B parameters can serve as effective Promptagator-style query
generators. We hope our work will inform practitioners with reliable
alternatives for synthetic data generation and give insights to maximize
fine-tuning results for domain-specific applications.

TL;DR: 提出选择性采样方法，在数学推理等需要高精度的任务中动态切换贪婪采样和高温采样，以平衡多样性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的高温采样方法在需要高精度的任务（如数学推理）中会降低推理质量，因为会在敏感解码位置采样错误的续写。

Method: 提出选择性采样方法，基于采样风险指标动态切换贪婪和高温采样。训练轻量级分类器预测采样风险，可集成到基础语言模型中。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，选择性采样即使在高温设置下也能改善质量-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: 选择性采样方法有效解决了高温采样在精度敏感任务中的问题，提升了输出质量与多样性的平衡。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决材料发现中缺乏大规模、机器可读数据集的问题，现有数据库要么规模小、手动整理，要么偏向第一性原理结果，实验文献利用不足。

Method: 采用基于LLM的智能工作流，结合动态令牌分配、零样本多智能体提取和条件表解析技术，在准确性和计算成本之间取得平衡。

Result: GPT-4.1达到最高准确率（热电性能F1=0.91，结构字段F1=0.82），GPT-4.1 Mini以更低的成本提供接近的性能。最终整理出包含ZT、塞贝克系数、电导率等热电性能以及晶体结构、掺杂策略等结构属性的数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了可复现且成本优化的数据提取流程，为超越热电领域的可扩展数据驱动材料发现奠定了基础，并发布了交互式网络浏览器便于社区访问。

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

TL;DR: RSAVQ是一个新颖的向量量化框架，通过几何驱动创新解决LLM极低位量化中的方向误差和位分配问题，在2位量化中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型参数指数增长给资源受限设备部署带来挑战，现有向量量化方法面临无约束方向误差和次优位分配两个关键问题。

Method: 提出RSAVQ框架，包含两个创新：1）误差方向敏感度引导(EDSG)，利用Fisher信息矩阵诱导的黎曼度量将量化误差投影到参数空间低敏感方向；2）权重通道敏感度引导(WCSG)，通过FIM曲率分析构建通道敏感度度量来动态指导位资源分配。

Result: 在LLaMA-3 8B的2位量化中，RSAVQ在困惑度上领先基线方法0.4，在零样本准确率上领先1.5。

Conclusion: 该工作为受限环境提供了实用解决方案，并在信息几何与神经网络量化之间建立了理论桥梁，推动了高效深度学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

TL;DR: RLP是一种信息驱动的强化预训练方法，将强化学习的探索精神引入预训练阶段，通过奖励思维链提供的信息增益来训练模型独立思考能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练范式只在最后阶段使用强化学习，作者质疑这是否是最优方式，希望将强化学习的核心精神——探索——更早地引入预训练过程。

Method: 将思维链视为探索性动作，基于思维链为预测未来token提供的信息增益计算奖励信号，在预训练阶段使用密集奖励进行训练。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B-Base上预训练后，8个数学科学基准平均提升19%；在Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2上平均从42.81%提升至61.32%，科学推理提升23%。

Conclusion: RLP成功弥合了下一token预测与有用思维链推理之间的差距，证明了将强化学习作为预训练目标的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

Conclusion: 在最优停止理论与推理时扩展之间建立了原则性桥梁，为LLM部署提供了理论性能保证和实际效率提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

TL;DR: TRAAC是一种在线后训练强化学习方法，通过自适应压缩推理步骤来解决模型在复杂推理任务中思考不足或过度思考的问题，实现推理长度与任务难度的自适应匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在复杂推理任务中面临思考不足（简单问题思考不够）和过度思考（复杂问题思考过多）的问题，无法根据任务难度自适应调整推理长度。

Method: 提出TRAAC方法，利用模型在长推理轨迹中的自注意力机制识别重要步骤并剪枝冗余步骤，同时估计任务难度并将其整合到训练奖励中，学习根据示例难度分配推理预算。

Result: 在多个任务上，TRAAC相比基础模型平均准确率提升8.4%，推理长度相对减少36.8%；相比最佳RL基线准确率提升7.9%，长度减少29.4%。在非数学数据集上也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TRAAC通过任务难度校准和基于注意力的压缩相结合，能够在多样化任务上实现推理精度和效率的同步提升，证明了对思考预算进行细粒度调整的有效性。

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现SFT（监督微调）的高分并不总能转化为RL（强化学习）后的性能提升，甚至可能比直接在基础模型上进行RL训练效果更差。提出了泛化损失和Pass@large k作为更好的RL结果预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前LLM推理后训练中SFT和RL两阶段独立训练的做法，质疑高SFT分数是否能可靠预测RL后的性能提升。

Method: 训练了数百个12B参数模型，使用SFT和GRPO进行RLVR，在7个数学基准上进行了多达256次重复的广泛评估，消耗超过100万GPU小时。

Result: 发现基于泛化损失和Pass@large k的预测比直接使用预RL性能预测更准确，R²系数和Spearman秩相关系数提高了0.5（2倍）。

Conclusion: SFT分数不是RL结果的可靠预测指标，泛化损失和Pass@large k是更好的替代指标，对实际应用有重要价值。

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: 大规模实证研究表明，在预训练中混合约30%的改写合成数据与自然网络数据可以加速5-10倍，但单独使用合成数据效果不佳，且不同合成数据类型对模型性能影响不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量训练数据对大型语言模型扩展至关重要但供应有限，合成数据技术有望突破这一限制，但需要系统评估其实际效果。

Method: 使用统一协议和缩放定律进行大规模实证研究（>1000个LLM，>10万GPU小时），比较自然网络数据、多种合成数据类型（改写文本、生成教材）及其混合。

Result: 单独使用改写合成数据预训练不比自然网络文本快；1/3改写合成数据与2/3自然网络数据混合可加速5-10倍；单独使用教材风格合成数据在许多下游领域损失更高；最佳合成数据比例约为30%；更大生成模型不一定产生更好数据。

Conclusion: 合成数据在预训练中具有条件性益处，改写合成数据在可预见规模内不会导致性能退化，但教材风格纯生成合成数据显示出'模型崩溃'模式，为实际应用提供指导。

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

*Adam Filipek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了稀疏查询注意力（SQA），通过减少查询头数量来降低注意力机制的计算复杂度，在长序列处理中实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多头注意力（MHA）在长序列处理中的二次计算复杂度问题，现有方法如MQA和GQA虽然解决了内存带宽瓶颈，但未减少注意力得分计算所需的FLOPs。

Method: 采用减少查询头数量的方法，而不是减少键/值头，从而直接降低注意力机制的计算复杂度。提出了SQA的理论基础、数学公式和架构变体。

Result: 在32k-200k tokens的长序列基准测试中，SQA在计算受限场景（如预训练、微调和编码器任务）中实现了高达3倍的吞吐量提升，且对模型质量影响很小。

Conclusion: SQA是一种有效的注意力优化方法，能够构建更高效和可扩展的模型，在Reactive Transformer架构开发过程中偶然发现，具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

TL;DR: StockBench是一个无污染基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在真实多个月股票交易环境中的表现，填补了金融领域动态交易评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融基准主要测试静态知识问答，无法捕捉交易的动态和迭代特性，金融领域作为具有直接经济价值和高风险决策的领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建StockBench基准，让代理接收每日市场信号（价格、基本面、新闻），做出顺序的买入、卖出或持有决策，使用累积回报、最大回撤和索提诺比率等金融指标评估性能。

Result: 评估显示大多数LLM代理难以超越简单的买入持有基准，但部分模型显示出获得更高回报和更有效管理风险的潜力。

Conclusion: 精通静态金融知识任务并不一定能转化为成功的交易策略，StockBench作为开源资源支持可重复性和该领域未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了ExGRPO框架，通过识别推理经验的价值指标（正确性和熵），组织并优先处理有价值的经验，使用混合策略目标来平衡探索与经验利用，从而改进大型语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准在线策略训练在单次更新后丢弃经验，导致计算效率低下和不稳定性。现有研究未充分探索经验特性对大型推理模型学习动态的影响。

Method: 提出ExGRPO框架，基于经验正确性和熵识别有价值经验，组织并优先处理这些经验，采用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用。

Result: 在五个骨干模型（1.5B-8B参数）上，ExGRPO在数学/通用基准上平均提升3.5/7.6分，并在强弱模型上都能稳定训练。

Conclusion: 原则性经验管理是高效可扩展RLVR的关键要素。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

<details>

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多轮交互场景下容易受到对抗攻击，现有方法要么依赖人工红队测试，要么使用预定义模板，未能充分探索多轮攻击的广阔空间。

Method: 将对话建模为序列决策问题，结合树搜索的在线策略强化学习框架，无需人工标注数据就能系统性地探索攻击策略。

Result: 在10个目标模型上攻击成功率比现有最佳方法提高25.9%以上，并能有效发现新的攻击策略。

Conclusion: DialTree-RPO框架能够自主发现多样化的多轮攻击策略，显著提高了攻击成功率，为LLM安全评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

Motivation: 传统神经网络训练采用固定优化方案，缺乏动态响应训练不稳定或问题的灵活性。

Method: 使用控制服务器作为中介，允许用户或AI代理在训练过程中实时调整超参数、训练数据和模型检查点。

Result: 通过三个案例研究表明，该方法提高了训练稳定性、降低了对初始超参数的敏感性，并增强了适应不断变化的用户需求的能力。

Conclusion: 为未来AI代理自主监控训练日志、主动解决不稳定性和优化训练动态的训练范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,
feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or
automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

Motivation: 多模态内容分析计算成本高且工程复杂，现有预训练模型难以有效融合处理视频等复杂数据。

Method: 设计候选流水线，结合预训练模型将视频转换为时间半结构化数据，再转换为帧级索引知识图谱。

Result: 创建了可查询的知识图谱表示，支持持续学习，能够通过交互方式动态整合新的领域特定知识。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态内容分析提供了一种高效的原型方法，解决了现有模型融合和复杂数据处理的技术挑战。

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and

pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.
