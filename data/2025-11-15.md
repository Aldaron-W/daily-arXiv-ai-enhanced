TL;DR: Omnilingual ASR是一个可扩展的大规模语音识别系统，通过7B参数的自监督预训练和编码器-解码器架构，能够仅用少量样本支持新语言，覆盖1600多种语言，其中500多种是首次获得ASR支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ASR系统主要支持高资源语言，全球7000多种语言中大多数缺乏支持，且传统架构扩展成本高、语言支持受限，存在伦理问题。

Method: 采用7B参数的自监督预训练学习鲁棒语音表示，引入编码器-解码器架构实现零样本泛化，利用LLM启发的解码器，结合公共资源和社区合作收集的多样化训练语料。

Result: 覆盖1600多种语言（500+首次支持），在低资源条件下相比先前系统有显著提升，展示了强大的泛化能力，提供从300M到7B的模型系列。

Conclusion: 该系统通过开源模型和工具降低了研究者和社区的参与门槛，促进了更广泛的参与，同时考虑了伦理因素和社会影响。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has advanced in high-resource languages, but most of the world's 7,000+ languages remain unsupported, leaving thousands of long-tail languages behind. Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation. Open-source artifacts are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/omnilingual-asr.

### [2] [Order Matters: Rethinking Prompt Construction in In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09700)
*Warren Li,Yiqian Wang,Zihan Wang,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现示例排序对上下文学习性能的影响与示例选择相当重要，挑战了传统认为示例选择更重要的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视上下文学习中示例选择与排序的相对重要性，传统观点认为示例选择比排序更重要，但缺乏系统验证。

Method: 在分类和生成任务上进行控制实验，使用多个开源模型家族(0.5B到27B参数)和GPT-5，系统比较示例选择和排序对性能的影响。

Result: 不同示例排序导致的性能方差与使用完全不同示例集的方差相当；使用开发集可以识别强排序，性能接近基于测试标签选择最佳排序的oracle。

Conclusion: 示例选择和排序在提示设计中具有同等且相互交织的重要性，需要重新审视上下文学习中的假设。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to perform new tasks by conditioning on a sequence of examples. Most prior work reasonably and intuitively assumes that which examples are chosen has a far greater effect on performance than how those examples are ordered, leading to a focus on example selection. We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels. Our findings highlight the equal and intertwined importance of example selection and ordering in prompt design, calling for a reexamination of the assumptions held in ICL.

### [3] [Contextual morphologically-guided tokenization for Latin encoder models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09709)
*Marisa Hudspeth,Patrick J. Burns,Brendan O'Connor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究拉丁语的形态感知分词方法，发现形态引导的分词能提升下游任务性能，特别是在领域外文本上表现更佳，证明了语言资源对形态复杂语言建模的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分词方法通常优先考虑信息理论目标而非语言目标，对形态丰富的语言效果不佳。拉丁语作为形态丰富的语言，拥有丰富的词典资源但预训练数据中等，这种差异在低资源语言建模讨论中常被忽视。

Method: 研究拉丁语的形态感知分词方法，利用其丰富的词典资源来指导分词过程。

Result: 形态引导的分词在四个下游任务上提高了整体性能，特别是在领域外文本上表现最显著，显示了模型改进的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 对于缺乏大规模预训练数据的低资源语言，开发和整合语言资源可以作为提高语言模型性能的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical component of language model pretraining, yet standard tokenization methods often prioritize information-theoretical goals like high compression and low fertility rather than linguistic goals like morphological alignment. In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages. For low-resource languages that lack large-scale pretraining data, the development and incorporation of linguistic resources can serve as a feasible alternative to improve LM performance.

### [4] [Assessing the Applicability of Natural Language Processing to Traditional Social Science Methodology: A Case Study in Identifying Strategic Signaling Patterns in Presidential Directives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09738)
*C. LeMay,A. Lane,J. Seales,M. Winstead,S. Baty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了NLP在从里根到克林顿政府时期的总统指令中提取主要主题的应用，比较了NLP与人工分析的结果，发现存在差异，表明需要进一步验证NLP在此类应用中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索NLP在处理大规模书面语料库中的潜力，特别是在识别总统指令中的信号主题方面，以评估NLP在社会科学研究中的实用性。

Method: 使用NLP技术从里根到克林顿政府时期的总统指令中提取主要主题，并与分析师的人工标注结果进行比较分析。

Result: NLP和人工分析师都能识别相关文档，显示了NLP在大规模书面语料研究中的潜在效用，但也发现了NLP与人工标注结果之间的差异。

Conclusion: 虽然NLP展示了在社会科学应用中的内在能力，但由于AI/ML领域的快速发展，现有工具已有改进，需要更多研究来评估NLP在此类用例中的有效性。

Abstract: Our research investigates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to extract main topics from a larger corpus of written data, as applied to the case of identifying signaling themes in Presidential Directives (PDs) from the Reagan through Clinton administrations. Analysts and NLP both identified relevant documents, demonstrating the potential utility of NLPs in research involving large written corpuses. However, we also identified discrepancies between NLP and human-labeled results that indicate a need for more research to assess the validity of NLP in this use case. The research was conducted in 2023, and the rapidly evolving landscape of AIML means existing tools have improved and new tools have been developed; this research displays the inherent capabilities of a potentially dated AI tool in emerging social science applications.

### [5] [How Small Can You Go? Compact Language Models for On-Device Critical Error Detection in Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09748)
*Muskaan Chopra,Lorenz Sparrenberg,Sarthak Khanna,Rafet Sifa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现约10亿参数的轻量级语言模型（如Gemma-3-1B）在机器翻译关键错误检测任务中能提供最佳质量-效率平衡，通过轻量级校准和小样本监督可实现可信的本地化错误检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在机器翻译评估方面表现出色，但其规模和成本限制了在边缘设备和隐私敏感工作流中的部署，需要研究更小模型在检测意义改变翻译错误方面的能力。

Method: 在英语->德语关键错误检测任务中，对多个小于20亿参数的模型进行基准测试，使用标准化提示、轻量级logit-bias校准和多数投票方法，评估语义质量和计算效率。

Result: Gemma-3-1B在SynCED-EnDe-2025数据集上达到MCC=0.77和F1-ERR=0.98，在MacBook Pro M4 Pro上保持400ms单样本延迟；Qwen-3-1.7B获得最高MCC但计算成本更高；超小模型（0.6B）在少量样本校准下仍可用但会低估实体和数字错误。

Conclusion: 经过指令调优的紧凑LLM结合轻量级校准和小样本监督，能够为机器翻译提供可信的本地关键错误检测，实现翻译流程中私密、低成本的错误筛查。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at evaluating machine translation (MT), but their scale and cost hinder deployment on edge devices and in privacy-sensitive workflows. We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors. Overall, compact, instruction-tuned LLMs augmented with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy, on-device CED for MT, enabling private, low-cost error screening in real-world translation pipelines. All datasets, prompts, and scripts are publicly available at our GitHub repository.

### [6] [Predicate-Argument Structure Divergences in Chinese and English Parallel Sentences and their Impact on Language Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09796)
*Rocco Tripodi,Xiaoyu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文分析了中英文平行句子中的谓词-论元结构，发现语言迁移具有不对称性，源语言的选择对跨语言NLP应用至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言NLP在低资源语言场景中应用广泛，但语言类型差异阻碍了语言迁移，特别是对于类型学上距离较远的语言。

Method: 通过分析中英文平行句子的谓词-论元结构，探索谓词注释的对齐和错位，提出结构差异分类，并进行注释投影实验的定性和定量分析。

Result: 语言迁移具有明显的不对称性，源语言的选择对跨语言NLP应用有重要影响。

Conclusion: 在提出跨语言NLP科学主张之前，需要仔细研究源语言选择问题，语言迁移的不对称性需要在转移学习应用中引起重视。

Abstract: Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained significant traction in recent years, offering practical solutions in low-resource settings by transferring linguistic knowledge from resource-rich to low-resource languages. This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric. An aspect that requires attention when it comes to selecting the source language in transfer learning applications and that needs to be investigated before any scientific claim about cross-lingual NLP is proposed.

### [7] [TARG: Training-Free Adaptive Retrieval Gating for Efficient RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09803)
*Yufeng Wang,Lu wei,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TARG是一种无需训练的自适应检索门控方法，通过基础模型的短无上下文草稿计算轻量级不确定性分数，仅在分数超过阈值时触发检索，显著减少检索次数和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成(RAG)虽然提高了事实准确性，但每次查询都检索会降低质量、增加token和延迟。需要一种智能的检索决策机制来平衡准确性和效率。

Method: 从基础模型的短无上下文草稿中，通过前缀logits计算三种轻量级不确定性分数：平均token熵、基于top-1/top-2 logit间隙的边际信号、或少量随机前缀的小N方差，仅当分数超过阈值时触发检索。

Result: 在NQ-Open、TriviaQA和PopQA数据集上，TARG与Always-RAG相比，在保持或提高EM/F1准确性的同时，减少了70-90%的检索次数，降低了端到端延迟，且开销接近Never-RAG。

Conclusion: TARG通过训练免费的自适应检索门控，有效平衡了RAG系统的准确性和效率，其中边际信号是现代指令调优LLM下的稳健默认选择，小N方差提供了保守的预算优先替代方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factuality but retrieving for every query often hurts quality while inflating tokens and latency. We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative. We provide ablations over gate type and prefix length and use a delta-latency view to make budget trade-offs explicit.

### [8] [Khmer Spellchecking: A Holistic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09812)
*Marry Kong,Rina Buoy,Sovisal Chenda,Nguonly Taing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种综合方法解决高棉语拼写检查问题，集成子词分割、命名实体识别、字素到音素转换和语言模型，达到94.4%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高棉语拼写检查面临词汇表与分词模型不匹配、单词多种书写形式、复合词灵活构成、专有名词误判等问题，现有解决方案无法充分应对这些挑战。

Method: 集成高棉语子词分割、命名实体识别、字素到音素转换和语言模型，识别潜在修正候选并排序最合适的候选。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法达到94.4%的高棉语拼写检查准确率，优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的综合方法有效解决了高棉语拼写检查的多重挑战，并创建了公开可用的基准数据集。

Abstract: Compared to English and other high-resource languages, spellchecking for Khmer remains an unresolved problem due to several challenges. First, there are misalignments between words in the lexicon and the word segmentation model. Second, a Khmer word can be written in different forms. Third, Khmer compound words are often loosely and easily formed, and these compound words are not always found in the lexicon. Fourth, some proper nouns may be flagged as misspellings due to the absence of a Khmer named-entity recognition (NER) model. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not adequately address these challenges. This paper proposes a holistic approach to the Khmer spellchecking problem by integrating Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer NER, Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to tackle these challenges, identify potential correction candidates, and rank the most suitable candidate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art Khmer spellchecking accuracy of up to 94.4%, compared to existing solutions. The benchmark datasets for Khmer spellchecking and NER tasks in this study will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 解决学生选择相关课程的挑战，弥合大学学习与行业期望之间的差距，帮助学生做出数据驱动和行业知情的课程决策。

Method: 采用数据挖掘和协同过滤技术分析历史课程和个人职业目标，结合机器学习算法构建推荐框架，并通过迭代原型设计和用户反馈优化前端界面。

Conclusion: 该课程推荐系统是促进学生终身学习和职业发展的有用工具，有望改善大学毕业生的就业成果，为大学教育提供数据驱动的决策支持。

Abstract: This paper aims to address the challenge of selecting relevant courses for students by proposing the design and development of a course recommendation system. The course recommendation system utilises a combination of data analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms to recommend courses that align with current industry trends and requirements. In order to provide customised suggestions, the study entails the design and implementation of an extensive algorithmic framework that combines machine learning methods, user preferences, and academic criteria. The system employs data mining and collaborative filtering techniques to examine past courses and individual career goals in order to provide course recommendations. Moreover, to improve the accessibility and usefulness of the recommendation system, special attention is given to the development of an easy-to-use front-end interface. The front-end design prioritises visual clarity, interaction, and simplicity through iterative prototyping and user input revisions, guaranteeing a smooth and captivating user experience. We refined and optimised the proposed system by incorporating user feedback, ensuring that it effectively meets the needs and preferences of its target users. The proposed course recommendation system could be a useful tool for students, instructors, and career advisers to use in promoting lifelong learning and professional progression as it fills the gap between university learning and industry expectations. We hope that the proposed course recommendation system will help university students in making data-drive and industry-informed course decisions, in turn, improving graduate outcomes for the university sector.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于RAG和微调LLM的课程问答系统，解决在线课程论坛中学生问题响应延迟和重复问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线课程论坛中学生数量增加导致问题响应不及时，教师面临大量重复性问题

Method: 使用开源大语言模型微调课程数据，结合RAG方法从本地知识库检索相关文档，并集成多链思维推理减少幻觉

Result: 在HotpotQA数据集上的实验表明，微调LLM+RAG方法在问答任务上表现优异

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决课程论坛中的问答问题，提升响应效率和质量

Abstract: The course forums are increasingly significant and play vital role in facilitating student discussions and answering their questions related to the course. It provides a platform for students to post their questions related to the content and admin issues related to the course. However, there are several challenges due to the increase in the number of students enrolled in the course. The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLM with RAG method has a strong performance on question answering task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TermGPT是一个多层级对比微调框架，通过构建句子图捕获语义和结构关系，生成具有区分性的正负样本，在句子和词元层级进行对比学习，提升领域术语的表示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的嵌入空间存在各向同性问题，在特定领域（如法律和金融）的术语级表示能力不足，这会影响下游任务如法律判决预测和金融风险分析的性能。

Method: 构建句子图捕获语义和结构关系，基于上下文和拓扑线索生成语义一致但具有区分性的正负样本，设计句子和词元层级的对比学习方法。

Result: 在金融和法律领域的术语区分任务中，TermGPT超越了现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的多层级对比微调框架有效解决了LLMs在领域术语表示上的局限性，特别是在金融和法律等专业领域。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in text generation tasks; however, their embedding spaces often suffer from the isotropy problem, resulting in poor discrimination of domain-specific terminology, particularly in legal and financial contexts. This weakness in terminology-level representation can severely hinder downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis, where subtle semantic distinctions are critical. To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues. We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination. To support robust evaluation, we construct the first financial terminology dataset derived from official regulatory documents. Experiments show that TermGPT outperforms existing baselines in term discrimination tasks within the finance and legal domains.

*Mingye Zhu,Yi Liu,Zheren Fu,Quan Wang,Yongdong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InTRO是一个新的框架，通过令牌级探索和自我反馈来解决大型语言模型在思维链推理中的训练挑战，避免了单一黄金答案的惩罚和强化学习的信用分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在训练LLMs进行思维链推理时面临两个主要问题：监督微调会惩罚同样有效的替代推理路径，而强化学习则面临信用分配困难和计算成本高的问题。

Method: InTRO利用修正因子（基于生成策略与其答案条件对应策略之间的信息差异估计的令牌级重要性权重）来进行信息丰富的下一个令牌选择，在单次前向传播中实现令牌级探索和自我生成反馈。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，InTRO始终优于其他基线方法，相对于基础模型将解决方案准确率提高了高达20%，并且生成的思维链更加简洁。

Conclusion: InTRO不仅提高了推理准确性，还实现了跨领域迁移，成功适应了数学领域之外的推理任务，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for chain-of-thought reasoning presents a significant challenge: supervised fine-tuning on a single "golden" rationale hurts generalization as it penalizes equally valid alternatives, whereas reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards struggles with credit assignment and prohibitive computational cost. To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity. Beyond this, InTRO enables cross-domain transfer, successfully adapting to out-of-domain reasoning tasks that extend beyond the realm of mathematics, demonstrating robust generalization.

TL;DR: HierRouter是一种分层路由方法，通过动态组装轻量级专业语言模型来提升LLM推理性能，在保持低成本的同时显著提高响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能优异，但计算和内存成本高昂，限制了在资源受限或实时场景中的部署。

Method: 将问题建模为有限时域马尔可夫决策过程，训练基于PPO的强化学习代理，在推理过程中根据上下文和累积成本动态选择模型。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，HierRouter相比独立使用单个模型，响应质量提升高达2.4倍，而额外推理成本极低。

Conclusion: 分层路由方法为实现成本高效、高性能的LLM推理提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art performance across many tasks but impose high computational and memory costs, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained or real-time settings. To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average. These results highlight the promise of hierarchical routing for cost-efficient, high-performance LLM inference. All codes can be found here https://github.com/ Nikunj-Gupta/hierouter.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnchTable是一个新颖框架，通过NTK安全向量蒸馏和干扰感知合并技术，在微调LLMs时保持安全对齐，防止有害输出，同时不影响任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在领域微调过程中安全对齐系统性退化的问题，防止产生有害输出并维护伦理准则。

Method: 使用基于神经正切核(NTK)的安全向量蒸馏方法解耦安全约束与任务推理，结合干扰感知合并技术平衡安全性和实用性。

Result: 在11个数据集上的评估显示，EnchTable显著降低不安全率，提高效用分数，并在对抗性攻击中表现优于厂商发布的安全模型。

Conclusion: EnchTable能够在不同架构和规模的LLMs中有效维持安全对齐，具有通用适用性和部署友好性。

Abstract: Many machine learning models are fine-tuned from large language models (LLMs) to achieve high performance in specialized domains like code generation, biomedical analysis, and mathematical problem solving. However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains. Additionally, we validate EnchTable can be seamlessly integrated into various deployment pipelines without significant overhead.

Abstract: To provide a unified and flexible solution for daily communication among hearing-impaired individuals, we introduce the Omni-Model paradigm into assistive technology and present HI-TransPA, an instruction-driven audio-visual personal assistant. The model fuses indistinct speech with high-frame-rate lip dynamics, enabling both translation and dialogue within a single multimodal framework. To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness. We further adopt a SigLIP encoder combined with a Unified 3D-Resampler to efficiently encode high-frame-rate lip motion. Experiments on our purpose-built HI-Dialogue dataset show that HI-TransPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both literal accuracy and semantic fidelity. This work establishes a foundation for applying Omni-Models to assistive communication technology, providing an end-to-end modeling framework and essential processing tools for future research.

TL;DR: 提出了Norm-RAG框架，用于多轮对话中的社会规范推理，通过检索增强和语义分块方法实现可解释的规范推理，并发布了MINDS双语数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会规范是主观的、依赖语境的，且因文化而异，现有方法主要针对孤立话语或合成对话，难以捕捉真实对话的流动性和多轮特性。

Method: Norm-RAG框架建模话语级属性（沟通意图、说话者角色、人际框架、语言线索），通过语义分块检索结构化规范文档，实现可解释的规范推理。

Result: 实验表明Norm-RAG提高了规范检测和泛化能力，在文化适应性和社交智能对话系统方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 该框架能够更好地处理多语言对话中的社会规范推理，为文化适应性和社交智能对话系统提供了改进方案。

Abstract: Social norms are implicit, culturally grounded expectations that guide interpersonal communication. Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression. Our experiments show that Norm-RAG improves norm detection and generalization, demonstrates improved performance for culturally adaptive and socially intelligent dialogue systems.

*Canwen Wang,Jionghao Lin,Kenneth R. Koedinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过扩展LLM提示策略到646道选择题，发现单纯使用LLM生成知识组件(KCs)效果不佳且冗余严重，提出基于余弦相似度的语义合并方法显著改善了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识组件(KCs)是自适应学习系统的核心，但手动识别是瓶颈。虽然LLM提供了自动化可能，但先前研究限于小数据集且产生冗余标签。

Method: 首先将"模拟教科书"LLM提示策略扩展到646道选择题数据集，然后提出基于余弦相似度的语义相似KC标签合并方法。

Result: 初始LLM方法表现差于专家设计模型(RMSE 0.4285 vs 0.4206)，生成过多KCs(569 vs 101)。使用余弦相似度阈值0.8的合并策略将KCs减少到428个，RMSE改善到0.4259。

Conclusion: 单纯扩展LLM生成不足够，但结合语义合并技术为自动化KC识别提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Knowledge Components (KCs) are foundational to adaptive learning systems, but their manual identification by domain experts is a significant bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a "simulated textbook" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在多跳推理任务中缺乏全局规划，容易陷入局部推理困境，且对检索内容的利用不足，忽视潜在线索，导致推理结果准确性无法保证。

Method: 提出递归评估与自适应规划(REAP)，包含子任务规划器(SP)和事实提取器(FE)模块。SP维护全局视角，FE进行细粒度分析提取可靠答案和线索，两模块协同工作动态优化任务解决轨迹。

Result: 在多个公开多跳数据集上的实验表明，该方法在领域内和领域外设置下均显著优于现有RAG方法。

Conclusion: REAP方法通过结构化子任务和事实维护，增强了多跳推理过程的可靠性和可追溯性，在复杂推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been extensively employed to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple public multi-hop datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing RAG methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, validating its effectiveness in complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型任务上表现优异，但在数值推理方面存在困难。本文旨在系统评估最先进模型在数值声明和证据对真实性预测任务中的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用受控扰动（包括标签翻转探针）来测试模型鲁棒性，评估状态最先进模型在数值声明验证任务上的表现，并研究上下文长度和扰动演示对性能的影响。

Result: 所有测试模型在特定扰动下都出现显著准确率下降（最高达62%），没有模型在所有条件下都保持稳健。增加上下文长度通常降低准确率，但用扰动演示丰富扩展上下文后，大多数模型能显著恢复性能。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在数值事实核查方面存在严重局限性，鲁棒性仍然是一个未解决的挑战，需要进一步研究和改进。

Abstract: Large language models show strong performance on knowledge intensive tasks such as fact-checking and question answering, yet they often struggle with numerical reasoning. We present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models for veracity prediction on numerical claims and evidence pairs using controlled perturbations, including label-flipping probes, to test robustness. Our results indicate that even leading proprietary systems experience accuracy drops of up to 62\% under certain perturbations. No model proves to be robust across all conditions. We further find that increasing context length generally reduces accuracy, but when extended context is enriched with perturbed demonstrations, most models substantially recover. These findings highlight critical limitations in numerical fact-checking and suggest that robustness remains an open challenge for current language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态RAG中确定最佳检索时机是一个核心挑战，现有基于token级置信度的方法可能导致错误传播后才进行干预，需要更早检测不确定性的方法。

Method: ETC方法利用熵序列的一阶和二阶差分来检测新兴的不确定性趋势，无需训练即可确定最佳检索时机，是即插即用、模型无关的方法。

Result: 在6个QA基准测试和3个LLM骨干网络上，ETC始终优于强基线方法，同时减少检索频率，在领域特定场景中表现尤为有效，具有鲁棒的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 趋势感知的不确定性建模能够产生更有效的检索时机，ETC方法简单易用，可轻松集成到现有解码流程中。

Abstract: Dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows large language models (LLMs) to fetch external knowledge on demand, offering greater adaptability than static RAG. A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing. The method is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and readily integrable into existing decoding pipelines. Implementation code is included in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多语言检索增强生成(RAG)中的输出语言漂移问题，并提出了一种无需训练的轻量级解码策略Soft Constrained Decoding(SCD)来解决该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言RAG中，当检索到的证据与用户查询和上下文示例的语言不同时，模型经常会出现语言漂移现象，生成非预期语言的响应。这种现象在推理密集型解码（如思维链生成）中尤为明显。

Method: 提出了Soft Constrained Decoding(SCD)方法，这是一种轻量级、无需训练的解码策略，通过惩罚非目标语言标记来温和地引导生成朝向目标语言。该方法与模型无关，可应用于任何生成算法。

Result: 在三个多语言数据集和多种类型学不同语言上的实验表明，SCD能够持续改善语言对齐和任务性能，提供了一种有效且可泛化的解决方案。

Conclusion: 语言漂移源于解码器级崩溃而非理解失败，英语在跨语言条件下充当语义吸引子。SCD为解决多语言RAG中的语言漂移问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform knowledge-intensive tasks in multilingual settings by leveraging retrieved documents as external evidence. However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.
  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现BERTScore在金融文本中无法有效区分关键数值差异（如2%收益与20%损失的差别），这在金融领域会严重影响语义理解。

Method: 构建FinNuE诊断数据集，包含财报电话会议、监管文件、社交媒体和新闻文章中的受控数值扰动文本对。

Result: BERTScore无法区分语义上关键的数值差异，经常为金融意义上截然不同的文本对分配高相似度分数。

Conclusion: 基于嵌入的评估指标在金融领域存在根本性局限，需要开发数值感知的金融NLP评估框架。

Abstract: BERTScore has become a widely adopted metric for evaluating semantic similarity between natural language sentences. However, we identify a critical limitation: BERTScore exhibits low sensitivity to numerical variation, a significant weakness in finance where numerical precision directly affects meaning (e.g., distinguishing a 2% gain from a 20% loss). We introduce FinNuE, a diagnostic dataset constructed with controlled numerical perturbations across earnings calls, regulatory filings, social media, and news articles. Using FinNuE, demonstrate that BERTScore fails to distinguish semantically critical numerical differences, often assigning high similarity scores to financially divergent text pairs. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations of embedding-based metrics for finance and motivate numerically-aware evaluation frameworks for financial NLP.

Conclusion: 分析了当前LLM在正式教育系统中作为AI学习工具的优势和局限性，为课程对齐的AI教育应用提供了框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like content. This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education. In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance. In this paper, we present the framework "PustakAI"\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset "NCERT-QA" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8. We classify the curated QA pairs as Factoid, Inferential, and Others (evaluative and reasoning). We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum. Along with the usability of the dataset, we analyze the strengths and limitations of current open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1b, Llama3.2:3b, and Nemotron-mini:4b) and high-end LLMs (Llama-4-Scout-17B and Deepseek-r1-70B) as AI-based learning tools in formal education systems.

Motivation: 标准自注意力的二次复杂度限制了Transformer模型在长上下文任务中的应用，现有高效变体通常需要架构更改和昂贵的从头预训练。

Method: 将长输入分段为重叠块，使用参数自由的融合机制，通过累积前后所有块的内容向量来丰富每个块的边界表示，赋予其文档内位置的结构感知。

Result: 在长文档摘要任务中，该方法与最先进方法竞争并经常优于它们，无需架构修改或外部检索机制。

Conclusion: ScaleFormer提供了一种简单有效的方法，使预训练模型能够有效推理长文本，实现线性复杂度并保持文档叙事流。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of standard self-attention severely limits the application of Transformer-based models to long-context tasks. While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text. Experiments on long-document summarization show that our method is highly competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without requiring architectural modifications or external retrieval mechanisms.

Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型如何解释人类语言中的听觉信息，特别是语音象征性这一语言学现象，作为理解模型认知能力的探针。

Method: 构建LEX-ICON数据集（包含4种语言的8052个真实词和2930个伪词），在25个语义维度上测试模型表现，通过音素级注意力分数分析模型层级信息处理。

Result: 发现MLLMs的语音直觉与现有语言学研究一致，且注意力模式显示出模型对标志性音素的关注。

Conclusion: 研究在人工智能与认知语言学之间建立桥梁，首次提供了MLLMs语音象征性可解释性的大规模定量分析。

Abstract: Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.

TL;DR: GraphIF是一个即插即用的框架，通过将多轮对话建模为有向关系图，利用图提示来增强大语言模型的多轮指令跟随能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多轮指令跟随方法主要依赖大规模多轮对话数据集来微调大语言模型，但这种方法将每个响应生成视为孤立任务，未能明确将多轮指令跟随纳入优化目标，导致模型在处理复杂长距离约束时表现不佳。

Method: GraphIF包含三个关键组件：(1)基于智能体的关系提取模块，通过动作触发机制捕捉轮次间的语义关系来构建结构化图；(2)关系图提示生成模块，将结构化图信息转换为自然语言提示；(3)响应重写模块，使用生成的图提示来优化初始LLM输出。

Result: 在两个长多轮对话数据集上的广泛实验表明，GraphIF可以无缝集成到指令微调的LLM中，并在所有四个多轮指令跟随评估指标上都带来了显著改进。

Conclusion: GraphIF框架成功地将图结构引入多轮指令跟随任务，通过建模对话中的关系约束显著提升了LLM在多轮对话中的指令跟随能力。

Abstract: Multi-turn instruction following is essential for building intelligent conversational systems that can consistently adhere to instructions across dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.

Result: 仅使用30%原始训练数据时，F1分数仅有小幅下降。模型在不同数据规模下都保持了较好的性能。

Conclusion: ADI-20数据集支持了有效的阿拉伯语方言识别研究，开源数据和模型有助于促进该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: We present ADI-20, an extension of the previously published ADI-17 Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) dataset. ADI-20 covers all Arabic-speaking countries' dialects. It comprises 3,556 hours from 19 Arabic dialects in addition to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We used this dataset to train and evaluate various state-of-the-art ADI systems. We explored fine-tuning pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN-based models, as well as Whisper encoder blocks coupled with an attention pooling layer and a classification dense layer. We investigated the effect of (i) training data size and (ii) the model's number of parameters on identification performance. Our results show a small decrease in F1 score while using only 30% of the original training data. We open-source our collected data and trained models to enable the reproduction of our work, as well as support further research in ADI.

Motivation: 随着科学论文数量的增长，需要系统辅助评审人员评估研究主张。当前多模态LLM在不同证据格式（表格和图表）下验证科学主张的鲁棒性仍是一个重要但未被充分探索的挑战。

Method: 设计实验评估12个多模态LLM使用表格和图表作为证据验证科学主张的能力，通过改编两个现有科学论文数据集，加入多模态主张验证任务所需的注释和结构。

Result: 当前模型在基于表格的证据上表现更好，而在基于图表的证据上表现较差。人类评估显示人类在两种格式上均表现良好。小模型（8B以下）在表格和图表任务间的性能相关性较弱，表明跨模态泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 当前模型在多模态推理能力上存在关键差距，未来多模态LLM应更注重改进图表理解能力，以更好地支持科学主张验证。

Abstract: With the growing number of submitted scientific papers, there is an increasing demand for systems that can assist reviewers in evaluating research claims. Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.

Motivation: 社交媒体已成为监测灾难事件的重要工具，但现有系统存在事件相关偏差问题，影响对新兴事件的泛化能力

Method: 采用因果学习视角，提出减少事件和领域相关偏差的方法

Result: 在三个灾难分类任务中，优于多个基线方法达+1.9% F1分数，并显著提升了基于预训练语言模型的分类器性能

Conclusion: 因果视角的偏差缓解方法能有效提高灾难事件分类系统的泛化能力

Abstract: Due to the rapid growth of social media platforms, these tools have become essential for monitoring information during ongoing disaster events. However, extracting valuable insights requires real-time processing of vast amounts of data. A major challenge in existing systems is their exposure to event-related biases, which negatively affects their ability to generalize to emerging events. While recent advancements in debiasing and causal learning offer promising solutions, they remain underexplored in the disaster event domain. In this work, we approach bias mitigation through a causal lens and propose a method to reduce event- and domain-related biases, enhancing generalization to future events. Our approach outperforms multiple baselines by up to +1.9% F1 and significantly improves a PLM-based classifier across three disaster classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮交互中的推理过程分析面临复杂上下文依赖和缺乏专门可视化工具的挑战，导致研究人员认知负荷高。

Method: 开发VISTA系统，提供上下文影响可视化、交互式对话历史修改、自动生成推理依赖树等功能。

Result: VISTA显著降低了推理链分析的复杂性，促进了对LLM能力和局限性的深入理解。

Conclusion: VISTA为多轮推理任务提供了一个统一且交互式的分析框架，支持自定义基准测试和本地模型集成。

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn interactions, as these scenarios more closely mirror real-world problem-solving. However, analyzing the intricate reasoning processes within these interactions presents a significant challenge due to complex contextual dependencies and a lack of specialized visualization tools, leading to a high cognitive load for researchers. To address this gap, we present VISTA, an web-based Visual Interactive System for Textual Analytics in multi-turn reasoning tasks. VISTA allows users to visualize the influence of context on model decisions and interactively modify conversation histories to conduct "what-if" analyses across different models. Furthermore, the platform can automatically parse a session and generate a reasoning dependency tree, offering a transparent view of the model's step-by-step logical path. By providing a unified and interactive framework, VISTA significantly reduces the complexity of analyzing reasoning chains, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs. The platform is open-source and supports easy integration of custom benchmarks and local models.

TL;DR: Text2SQL-Flow是一个SQL感知的数据增强框架，通过六维增强生成大规模、语义有效、结构多样的Text-to-SQL对，构建了包含89,544个标注示例的高质量SQLFlow数据集，显著提升了开源和闭源LLM在Text-to-SQL任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Text-to-SQL领域中数据稀缺、简单且多样性不足的问题，这些限制影响了AI系统的性能表现。

Method: 提出Text2SQL-Flow框架，包含六维数据增强、SQL执行验证、自然语言问题生成、思维链推理跟踪和数据分类的端到端流程，以及确保跨数据库兼容性的模块化数据库管理器。

Result: 构建了SQLFlow数据集（89,544个示例），在开源LLM上微调和在闭源LLM上使用掩码对齐检索方法均显著提升了性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 为Text-to-SQL系统建立了可扩展的数据中心基础，强调了高质量结构化数据在现代AI中的关键作用。

Abstract: The data-centric paradigm has become pivotal in AI, especially for Text-to-SQL, where performance is limited by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets. To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries. Experiments show our retrieval strategy outperforms existing methods, underscoring the value of SQLFlow's high-fidelity data and our novel technique. Our work establishes a scalable, data-centric foundation for advancing Text-to-SQL systems and highlights the critical role of high-quality structured data in modern AI.

TL;DR: EffiReason-Bench是一个统一的基准测试，用于评估高效推理方法，通过标准化评估流程和E3-Score指标来解决现有方法比较的碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs的Chain-of-Thought推理方法往往产生冗长的解释，增加了成本并可能降低准确性，且缺乏统一的评估标准来公平比较不同高效推理方法。

Method: 构建EffiReason-Bench基准，包含三个推理方法类别：推理蓝图、动态执行和后处理优化；通过标准化推理结构、全面选项分析和人工验证创建验证过的CoT标注；提出E3-Score评估指标。

Result: 在6个开源LLM（1B-70B）和4个数据集上的实验表明，没有单一方法在所有情况下最优，最佳策略取决于模型规模、任务复杂度和架构。

Conclusion: 高效推理方法的选择需要根据具体场景定制，EffiReason-Bench为系统评估提供了统一框架，E3-Score提供了平滑稳定的评估指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting achieve strong reasoning but often produce unnecessarily long explanations, increasing cost and sometimes reducing accuracy. Fair comparison of efficiency-oriented approaches is hindered by fragmented evaluation practices. We introduce EffiReason-Bench, a unified benchmark for rigorous cross-paradigm evaluation of efficient reasoning methods across three categories: Reasoning Blueprints, Dynamic Execution, and Post-hoc Refinement. To enable step-by-step evaluation, we construct verified CoT annotations for CommonsenseQA and LogiQA via a pipeline that enforces standardized reasoning structures, comprehensive option-wise analysis, and human verification. We evaluate 7 methods across 6 open-source LLMs (1B-70B) on 4 datasets spanning mathematics, commonsense, and logic, and propose the E3-Score, a principled metric inspired by economic trade-off modeling that provides smooth, stable evaluation without discontinuities or heavy reliance on heuristics. Experiments show that no single method universally dominates; optimal strategies depend on backbone scale, task complexity, and architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流个性化对话生成模型通常依赖词级语言模型训练，容易忽视给定人设信息，生成通用回复而非个性化回复。

Method: 提出PAL框架，包含人设感知学习和人设对齐两阶段训练，以及"选择后生成"推理策略，在语义层面提升人设敏感度。

Result: 实验表明PAL框架优于多种最先进的个性化对话方法和大型语言模型。

Conclusion: PAL框架通过直接以人设对齐为训练目标，能生成更相关的人设化回复，提升个性化对话生成效果。

Abstract: Personalized dialogue generation aims to leverage persona profiles and dialogue history to generate persona-relevant and consistent responses. Mainstream models typically rely on token-level language model training with persona dialogue data, such as Next Token Prediction, to implicitly achieve personalization, making these methods tend to neglect the given personas and generate generic responses. To address this issue, we propose a novel Persona-Aware Alignment Framework (PAL), which directly treats persona alignment as the training objective of dialogue generation. Specifically, PAL employs a two-stage training method including Persona-aware Learning and Persona Alignment, equipped with an easy-to-use inference strategy Select then Generate, to improve persona sensitivity and generate more persona-relevant responses at the semantics level. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms many state-of-the-art personalized dialogue methods and large language models.

TL;DR: LangGPS是一个基于语言可分性的轻量级两阶段预选择框架，通过量化不同语言样本在模型表示空间中的可区分度来优化多语言训练数据选择，提升现有选择方法的有效性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言训练数据选择方法通常忽略数据的内在语言结构，导致多语言能力对训练数据组成高度敏感。

Method: 提出LangGPS两阶段框架：首先基于语言可分性分数过滤训练数据，然后使用现有选择方法精炼子集。语言可分性量化不同语言样本在模型表示空间中的可区分度。

Result: 在6个基准测试和22种语言上的实验表明，LangGPS能显著提升现有选择方法的有效性和泛化能力，特别是在理解任务和低资源语言上。高可分性样本促进清晰语言边界的形成，低可分性样本则作为跨语言对齐的桥梁。

Conclusion: 语言可分性可作为多语言语境中数据效用的新视角，支持开发更具语言感知能力的大语言模型，并可作为多语言课程学习的有效信号。

Abstract: Joint multilingual instruction tuning is a widely adopted approach to improve the multilingual instruction-following ability and downstream performance of large language models (LLMs), but the resulting multilingual capability remains highly sensitive to the composition and selection of the training data. Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains. Together, we hope our work offers a new perspective on data utility in multilingual contexts and support the development of more linguistically informed LLMs.

Result: 首块延迟从约725ms降至350ms，在主流语音模型中保持竞争性能。

Conclusion: 为实时交互应用开发高效高性能语音模型提供了有价值见解，并比较了单码本和多码本策略。

Abstract: Current end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have made notable progress, yet they still encounter considerable response latency. This delay primarily arises from the autoregressive generation of speech tokens and the reliance on complex flow-matching models for speech synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce VocalNet-M2, a novel low-latency SLM that integrates a multi-codebook tokenizer and a multi-token prediction (MTP) strategy. Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model. Furthermore, our MTP strategy enhances generation efficiency and improves overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单轮交互和对话特征，忽视了多轮通信的复杂性以及指令遵循和安全性等关键能力。全双工语音语言模型在多轮设置下的评估面临对话边界模糊和上下文不一致等挑战。

Method: 通过将连续的全双工对话分割为离散的轮次，构建MTR-DuplexBench基准，支持在对话质量、对话动态、指令遵循和安全性四个维度上进行逐轮评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前的全双工语音语言模型在保持多轮和多个评估维度上的一致性表现方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 提出的基准对于评估和改进全双工语音语言模型在多轮对话中的性能是必要且有效的。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) enable real-time, overlapping conversational interactions, offering a more dynamic user experience compared to traditional half-duplex models. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions and conversational features, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication and critical capabilities such as instruction following and safety. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark. The benchmark and code will be available in the future.

Abstract: Organizations handling sensitive documents face a critical dilemma: adopt cloud-based AI systems that offer powerful question-answering capabilities but compromise data privacy, or maintain local processing that ensures security but delivers poor accuracy. We present a question-answering system that resolves this trade-off by combining semantic understanding with keyword precision, operating entirely on local infrastructure without internet access. Our approach demonstrates that organizations can achieve competitive accuracy on complex queries across legal, scientific, and conversational documents while keeping all data on their machines. By balancing two complementary retrieval strategies and using consumer-grade hardware acceleration, the system delivers reliable answers with minimal errors, letting banks, hospitals, and law firms adopt conversational document AI without transmitting proprietary information to external providers. This work establishes that privacy and performance need not be mutually exclusive in enterprise AI deployment.

Abstract: To improve Multi-step Mathematical Reasoning (MsMR) of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to obtain scalable supervision from the corpus by automatically critiquing mistakes in the reasoning process of MsMR and rendering a final verdict of the problem-solution. Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct. Extensive experimental results on our built OPS and existing available critic benchmarks demonstrate the validity of our method.

Abstract: In the context of pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs), synthetic data has emerged as an alternative for generating high-quality pretraining data at scale. This is particularly beneficial in low-resource language settings where the benefits of recent LLMs have been unevenly distributed across languages. In this work, we present a systematic study on the generation and evaluation of synthetic multilingual pretraining data for Indic languages, where we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset BhashaKritika, comprising 540B tokens using 5 different techniques for 10 languages. We explore the impact of grounding generation in documents, personas, and topics. We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages. To support scalable and language-sensitive evaluation, we introduce a modular quality evaluation pipeline that integrates script and language detection, metadata consistency checks, n-gram repetition analysis, and perplexity-based filtering using KenLM models. Our framework enables robust quality control across diverse scripts and linguistic contexts. Empirical results through model runs reveal key trade-offs in generation strategies and highlight best practices for constructing effective multilingual corpora.

Motivation: 文化遗产文本包含丰富知识，但由于从非结构化文本转换为结构化知识图谱的挑战，难以系统查询。

Method: 结合标注模型、本体框架和LLM提取的五步迭代方法：基础分析、标注模式开发、管道架构、集成优化和综合评估，使用三个LLM构建顺序管道。

Result: 成功提取复杂文化遗产知识：元数据提取F1 0.96-0.99，实体识别0.7-0.8，假设提取0.65-0.75，证据提取0.95-0.97，话语表示0.62 G-EVAL。较小模型表现有竞争力。

Conclusion: 这是首个协调LLM提取与文化遗产本体的系统方法，提供可复现框架，但需要人工监督后处理，支持文化遗产机构系统化知识转换。

Abstract: Cultural Heritage texts contain rich knowledge that is difficult to query systematically due to the challenges of converting unstructured discourse into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing. Practical Implications - ATR4CH enables Cultural Heritage institutions to systematically convert textual knowledge into queryable KGs, supporting automated metadata enrichment and knowledge discovery.

Conclusion: TruthfulRAG是首个利用知识图谱解决RAG系统中事实级知识冲突的框架，能够使LLM生成更忠实和准确的响应。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval-based methods with generative models. As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.

*Jason Chan,Zhixue Zhao,Robert Gaizauskas*

TL;DR: 本文质疑评估基础大语言模型推理能力的现有方法，指出预训练目标与推理评估标准之间存在根本性不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在评估基础LLMs的推理能力时忽略了方法论问题，作者认为需要重新审视这些评估方法的有效性。

Method: 通过分析基础LLMs的预训练目标与推理评估标准之间的不匹配，论证现有评估方法的内在缺陷。

Result: 发现基础LLMs生成逻辑有效或无效结论只是语言模式统计可能性的副产品，而非真正的推理尝试。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新审视依赖这些假设的现有研究，并建议未来工作要考虑这些方法论陷阱。

Abstract: Existing work investigates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to uncover their limitations, human-like biases and underlying processes. Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following. We call for a critical re-examination of existing work that relies implicitly on these assumptions, and for future work to account for these methodological pitfalls.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELICATE是一种用于历史意大利语实体链接的神经符号方法，结合BERT编码器和Wikidata上下文信息，通过时间合理性和实体类型一致性选择知识库实体。ENEIDE是一个历史意大利语多领域实体链接语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人文学科中实体链接面临的挑战：复杂文档类型、缺乏领域特定数据集和模型、长尾实体问题。

Method: 提出DELICATE神经符号方法，结合BERT编码器与Wikidata上下文信息，使用时间合理性和实体类型一致性进行实体选择；构建ENEIDE多领域历史意大利语语料库。

Result: DELICATE在历史意大利语实体链接任务中优于其他模型，即使与具有数十亿参数的大型架构相比；其置信度分数和特征敏感性提供了比纯神经方法更可解释的结果。

Conclusion: DELICATE方法在历史意大利语实体链接任务中表现出色，提供了更好的可解释性，ENEIDE语料库为领域研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: In spite of the remarkable advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing, the task of Entity Linking (EL) remains challenging in the field of humanities due to complex document typologies, lack of domain-specific datasets and models, and long-tail entities, i.e., entities under-represented in Knowledge Bases (KBs). The goal of this paper is to address these issues with two main contributions. The first contribution is DELICATE, a novel neuro-symbolic method for EL on historical Italian which combines a BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata to select appropriate KB entities using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. The second contribution is ENEIDE, a multi-domain EL corpus in historical Italian semi-automatically extracted from two annotated editions spanning from the 19th to the 20th century and including literary and political texts. Results show how DELICATE outperforms other EL models in historical Italian even if compared with larger architectures with billions of parameters. Moreover, further analyses reveal how DELICATE confidence scores and features sensitivity provide results which are more explainable and interpretable than purely neural methods.

TL;DR: 轻量级模型通过类比范式组织，仅用100个结构化示例就能在英语使役/起始交替任务上达到F1=0.95，超越GPT-3的零样本性能，证明类比方法能大幅减少数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否通过类比范式组织，能让轻量级模型在少量数据下达到与大型语言模型相当的性能，解决大模型对海量数据的依赖问题。

Method: 采用计算化方法实现三个认知启发原则：类比结构、对比学习和最小上下文线索，在结构化补全任务中让模型从类比模式识别正确句子补全。

Result: BERT+CNN轻量模型（50万参数）在100个英语使役/起始交替示例上训练达到F1=0.95，优于GPT-3零样本（F1=0.87），消融研究确认类比组织和对比结构提升性能。

Conclusion: 类比范式组织能够以数量级更少的数据实现有竞争力的语言规则学习，为高效模型训练提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong performance through training on vast datasets. Can analogical paradigm organization enable lightweight models to match this performance with minimal data? We develop a computational approach implementing three cognitive-inspired principles: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues. We test this approach with structured completion tasks where models identify correct sentence completions from analogical patterns with contrastive alternatives. Training lightweight models (BERT+CNN, $0.5M$ parameters) on only one hundred structured examples of English causative/inchoative alternations achieves $F1=0.95$, outperforming zero-shot \texttt{GPT-o3} ($F1=0.87$). Ablation studies confirm that analogical organization and contrastive structure improve performance, consistently surpassing randomly shuffled baselines across architectures. Cross-phenomenon validation using unspecified object alternations replicates these efficiency gains, confirming approach robustness. Our results show that analogical paradigm organization enables competitive linguistic rule learning with orders of magnitude less data than conventional approaches require.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对模糊请求生成多个解释-答案对的方法，通过强化学习和定制奖励函数训练模型，在单次生成中覆盖更多有效答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理模糊请求时通常只隐含地承诺一种解释，这种意图误解会使用户感到沮丧并带来安全风险。

Method: 使用强化学习和定制奖励函数训练模型，以多个有效答案作为监督，在单个结构化响应中生成多个解释-答案对。

Result: 在对话问答和语义解析任务上的实验表明，该方法比基线方法实现了更高的有效答案覆盖率，人类评估确认预测解释与答案高度一致。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式解释提高透明度，只需一次生成步骤实现效率，并通过结构化输出格式支持下游应用。

Abstract: Large language models often respond to ambiguous requests by implicitly committing to one interpretation. Intent misunderstandings can frustrate users and create safety risks. To address this, we propose generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single structured response to ambiguous requests. Our models are trained with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision. Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches. Human evaluation confirms that predicted interpretations are highly aligned with their answers. Our approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and supports downstream applications through its structured output format.

TL;DR: LLMs在状态跟踪任务中的表现评估，新代模型（GPT-4、Llama3）表现良好，老代模型在多个步骤后失败


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在状态跟踪任务中的能力，将状态跟踪组件与其他因素分离进行专门分析

Method: 基于三个明确定义的状态跟踪任务构建基准，分析LLMs在不同场景下的表现，包括使用思维链机制

Result: 新一代LLMs能够有效跟踪状态，特别是结合思维链机制时；老一代模型虽然理解任务并在初始阶段能解决，但在一定步骤数后经常失败

Conclusion: 新一代LLMs在状态跟踪方面表现良好，但模型能力存在代际差异，思维链等机制能显著提升性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex tasks, including those requiring a certain level of reasoning. In this paper, we focus on state tracking, a problem where models need to keep track of the state governing a number of entities. To isolate the state tracking component from other factors, we propose a benchmark based on three well-defined state tracking tasks and analyse the performance of LLMs in different scenarios. The results indicate that the recent generation of LLMs (specifically, GPT-4 and Llama3) are capable of tracking state, especially when integrated with mechanisms such as Chain of Thought. However, models from the former generation, while understanding the task and being able to solve it at the initial stages, often fail at this task after a certain number of steps.

TL;DR: 提出了LocalBench基准，用于系统评估LLMs在美国县级本地知识方面的能力，发现现有模型在本地知识推理方面存在严重不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法捕捉超本地知识的复杂性，而现实应用需要AI系统能够理解社区特定的动态、文化叙事和本地治理。

Method: 基于本地性概念框架，构建了包含14,782个验证问答对的LocalBench基准，涵盖526个美国县，整合人口普查数据、本地论坛讨论和区域新闻等多种来源。

Result: 评估13个最先进LLMs显示，最佳模型在叙事式问题上的准确率仅为56.8%，数值推理低于15.5%。模型规模和网络增强并不保证性能提升，搜索对Gemini提升13.6%，但对GPT系列降低11.4%。

Conclusion: 迫切需要能够支持公平、位置感知AI系统的语言模型，以应对不同地理和文化背景下本地社区的多样化、细粒度现实。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on macro-scale geographic tasks, such as global factual recall, event summarization, and regional reasoning. Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.

TL;DR: KPPO是一个基于知识供给的提示优化框架，通过系统化知识整合而非潜在能力激发来解决知识密集型任务中的提示优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注激发模型能力，但在知识密集型任务中存在根本性局限，因为它们无法提供所需的事实知识、术语精度和推理模式。

Method: KPPO框架包含三个关键创新：1）知识差距填补机制；2）批量候选评估方法；3）自适应知识剪枝策略。

Result: 在15个知识密集型基准测试中，KPPO相比基于激发的方法平均性能提升约6%，同时减少高达29%的token使用量。

Conclusion: KPPO通过将提示优化重新定义为系统化知识整合，在知识密集型任务中显著优于传统的基于激发的优化方法。

Abstract: While prompt optimization has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing language model performance, existing approaches primarily focus on elicitation-based strategies that search for optimal prompts to activate models' capabilities. These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

Method: 构建包含1600+提示的AdvancedIF基准，提出RIFL训练框架，包括规则生成、微调规则验证器和奖励塑造，用于强化学习训练

Result: RIFL显著提升模型指令遵循能力，在AdvancedIF上获得6.7%绝对提升，在公开基准上表现优异

Conclusion: 规则作为训练和评估大语言模型高级指令遵循能力的有效工具，为开发更可靠AI系统铺平道路

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive performance on a range of tasks, yet advanced instruction following (IF)-especially for complex, multi-turn, and system-prompted instructions-remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.

TL;DR: 研究发现语言风格变换可作为新的越狱攻击面，通过将有害提示重写为恐惧、好奇等11种不同风格，能显著提高对齐模型的越狱成功率，并提出风格中和预处理方法来缓解此漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型主要评估对语义等价提示的鲁棒性，但忽略了语言风格变化作为攻击面的潜在风险。

Method: 构建风格增强的越狱基准，将3个标准数据集中的提示转换为11种不同语言风格，使用手工模板和LLM重写来保持语义意图不变。

Result: 评估16个开源和闭源指令调优模型发现，风格重构使越狱成功率最高提升57个百分点，恐惧、好奇和同情等风格最有效。

Conclusion: 语言风格变换是一个被当前安全流程忽视的系统性且难以通过规模扩展解决的漏洞，需要专门的防御措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated for robustness against paraphrased or semantically equivalent jailbreak prompts, yet little attention has been paid to linguistic variation as an attack surface. In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.
  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates. Our findings reveal a systemic and scaling-resistant vulnerability overlooked in current safety pipelines.

Motivation: 现有对话记忆评估基准存在统计功效不足、数据生成不一致和评估灵活性有限等根本性挑战，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含用户事实、助手回忆、弃权、偏好、时间变化和隐式连接等多样化类别的对话记忆基准，比较全上下文方法与RAG方法的性能。

Result: 简单全上下文方法在最具挑战性的多消息证据案例中达到70-82%准确率，而复杂RAG系统如Mem0仅达到30-45%。长上下文方法在前30次对话中表现最佳，在150次对话内仍可行。

Conclusion: 对话记忆的小语料优势值得专门研究关注，而非简单应用通用RAG解决方案到对话历史中，需要根据对话次数采用混合方法。

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for conversational memory evaluation containing 75,336 question-answer pairs across diverse categories including user facts, assistant recall, abstention, preferences, temporal changes, and implicit connections. While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.

Method: 使用CONLIT数据集构建文学小说和体裁小说语料库，采用Welch's ANOVA比较叙事特征分布，使用逻辑回归建模特征对文学分类的影响，分析风格和语义向量表示。

Conclusion: 文学体裁具有可量化的形式特征，作者性别在文学分类中起着重要的调节作用，女性作者面临更严格的文学地位评判标准。

Abstract: Though the concept of genre has been a subject of discussion for millennia, the relatively recent emergence of genre fiction has added a new layer to this ongoing conversation. While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.

Motivation: 解决现有MLLMs在长文档理解中的两个核心问题：大量无关内容的信息干扰，以及Transformer架构的二次计算成本。现有方法要么牺牲细节精度，要么增加系统复杂度。

Method: 提出URaG框架，引入轻量级跨模态检索模块，将早期Transformer层转换为高效证据选择器，识别并保留最相关页面，丢弃无关内容，使深层层专注于相关信息。

Result: 在广泛实验中，URaG实现了最先进的性能，同时将计算开销减少了44-56%。

Conclusion: URaG证明了MLLMs固有的证据定位能力可以显式地用于推理过程中的检索，为高效长文档理解提供了简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with long document understanding due to two fundamental challenges: information interference from abundant irrelevant content, and the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based architectures. Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%. The code is available at https://github.com/shi-yx/URaG.

Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis faces ongoing challenges in Aspect Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE), particularly in accurately capturing the relationships between aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities. While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text.

TL;DR: 本文评估了MedGemma模型在医疗订单提取任务中的表现，比较了三种提示范式，发现简单的one-shot方法在官方验证集上表现最佳，而复杂的推理框架可能导致过度思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确提取医患对话中的医疗订单对于减轻临床文档负担和确保患者安全至关重要，本文旨在为MEDIQA-OE-2025共享任务提供解决方案。

Method: 系统评估了MedGemma模型的三种提示范式：简单的one-shot方法、推理导向的ReAct框架和多步骤智能体工作流。

Result: 实验表明，虽然ReAct和智能体流程等复杂框架功能强大，但简单的one-shot提示方法在官方验证集上获得了最高性能。

Conclusion: 在手动标注的转录本上，复杂的推理链可能导致"过度思考"并引入噪声，因此直接方法更加稳健高效。这项工作为不同数据条件下选择适当的临床信息提取提示策略提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: The accurate extraction of medical orders from doctor-patient conversations is a critical task for reducing clinical documentation burdens and ensuring patient safety. This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种互补的方法来处理伤口护理查询：基于挖掘提示的策略和基于元数据引导的生成方法，旨在提高AI系统在异步远程护理中的效率和响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步远程护理的快速发展增加了医护人员的工作负担，需要AI系统来更高效地处理患者查询，特别是结合图像的伤口护理问题。

Method: 1. 挖掘提示策略：嵌入训练数据并检索最相似的示例作为少样本演示；2. 元数据引导生成：识别四个能提升响应质量的元数据属性，训练分类器预测这些属性并动态调整生成过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，挖掘提示提高了响应相关性，而元数据引导生成进一步提升了临床精确度。

Conclusion: 这两种方法为开发能够提供可靠高效伤口护理支持的AI驱动工具指明了有前景的方向。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of asynchronous remote care has intensified provider workload, creating demand for AI systems that can assist clinicians in managing patient queries more efficiently. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.

*Benjamin L. Badger,Matthew Neligeorge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种编码器增强的因果解码器模型架构，通过考虑语言的信息熵约束来改进语言模型训练，证明接近但不超出估计每词元熵的训练能提高模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于因果语言模型的语言压缩算法难以准确估计语言熵，且计算成本高昂，需要更高效的训练方法和更好的熵估计技术。

Method: 引入编码器增强的因果解码器模型架构，在适度硬件上训练，获得每词元熵估计，并训练模型接近但不超出估计的熵值。

Result: 新架构展现出优越的训练效率特性，比因果变换器实现更高压缩率，且接近熵值的模型比单纯最小化损失的模型具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 考虑语言信息熵约束的训练方法能有效提升语言模型的泛化性能，为语言压缩和模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Language prediction is constrained by informational entropy intrinsic to language, such that there exists a limit to how accurate any language model can become and equivalently a lower bound to language compression. The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.

TL;DR: SSR框架通过将LLM响应分解为可验证的子问题-子答案对，实现细粒度评估和精确优化推理过程，在多个推理基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时框架依赖粗粒度的自我验证和修正，限制了在复杂任务上的有效性，需要更精细的推理评估和优化方法。

Method: 将模型响应分解为可验证的子问题-子答案对，通过受控重解和自一致性检查进行步骤级置信度估计，精确定位不可靠步骤并进行迭代优化。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试和三个LLM上的实证结果表明，SSR始终优于最先进的迭代自优化基线方法。

Conclusion: SSR不仅提升了性能，还为评估和理解LLM内部推理过程提供了原则性的黑盒方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet existing test-time frameworks often rely on coarse self-verification and self-correction, limiting their effectiveness on complex tasks. In this paper, we propose Socratic Self-Refine (SSR), a novel framework for fine-grained evaluation and precise refinement of LLM reasoning. Our proposed SSR decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains. Empirical results across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs show that SSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines. Beyond performance gains, SSR provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/socratic-self-refine-reasoning.

Method: 使用AMD Instinct MI300X GPU进行大规模预训练、通用指令微调以及与人类偏好的对齐。虽然预训练token数量少于同类模型，但通过专门训练流程开发了Instella系列模型。

Result: Instella在完全开放模型中达到最先进水平，并与同规模领先开放权重模型具有竞争力。Instella-Long支持128K上下文长度，Instella-Math在数学推理任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: Instella系列为社区提供了透明、高性能且多功能的替代方案，推动了开放和可复现语言建模研究的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet the majority of high-performing models remain closed-source or partially open, limiting transparency and reproducibility. In this work, we introduce Instella, a family of fully open three billion parameter language models trained entirely on openly available data and codebase. Powered by AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs, Instella is developed through large-scale pre-training, general-purpose instruction tuning, and alignment with human preferences. Despite using substantially fewer pre-training tokens than many contemporaries, Instella achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open models and is competitive with leading open-weight models of comparable size. We further release two specialized variants: Instella-Long, capable of handling context lengths up to 128K tokens, and Instella-Math, a reasoning-focused model enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on mathematical tasks. Together, these contributions establish Instella as a transparent, performant, and versatile alternative for the community, advancing the goal of open and reproducible language modeling research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出生成对抗蒸馏(GAD)方法，通过将学生LLM作为生成器、训练判别器区分学生和教师模型的响应，实现黑盒蒸馏，在自动评估中表现优于传统序列级知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒蒸馏中无法访问教师模型内部logits或参数的问题，实现基于策略的黑盒蒸馏。

Method: 将学生LLM作为生成器，训练判别器区分学生和教师模型的响应，形成极小极大博弈，判别器作为基于策略的奖励模型与学生共同进化。

Result: GAD持续超越传统序列级知识蒸馏，Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct学生模型在LMSYS-Chat自动评估中达到与教师GPT-5-Chat相当的水平。

Conclusion: GAD是黑盒LLM蒸馏中一个有前景且有效的范式。

Abstract: Black-box distillation creates student large language models (LLMs) by learning from a proprietary teacher model's text outputs alone, without access to its internal logits or parameters. In this work, we introduce Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy and black-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game. The discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model that co-evolves with the student, providing stable, adaptive feedback. Experimental results show that GAD consistently surpasses the commonly used sequence-level knowledge distillation. In particular, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (student) trained with GAD becomes comparable to its teacher, GPT-5-Chat, on the LMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation. The results establish GAD as a promising and effective paradigm for black-box LLM distillation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParoQuant是一种仅权重的后训练量化方法，通过成对旋转量化和通道缩放来减少异常值影响，在推理任务上比AWQ平均提升2.4%准确率，同时保持低于10%的开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中的权重和激活值存在异常值，导致量化误差大和精度严重下降，特别是在推理任务中误差会在长思维链中累积。现有PTQ方法要么无法充分抑制异常值，要么在推理时引入显著开销。

Method: 结合硬件高效的独立Givens旋转和通道缩放，平衡通道间幅度并缩小每个量化组内的动态范围；同时协同设计推理内核以充分利用GPU并行性，保持旋转和缩放操作在运行时轻量。

Result: 在推理任务上比AWQ平均提升2.4%准确率，同时保持低于10%的开销。

Conclusion: 该方法为推理LLM的更高效和准确部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) into low-precision representations to reduce memory footprint and accelerate inference. However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead. This paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Music Flamingo是一个新颖的大型音频语言模型，专门用于提升音乐理解能力。它通过构建大规模数据集MF-Skills、增强的Audio Flamingo 3骨干网络、以及包含思维链训练和强化学习的后训练方法，在10多个音乐理解和推理基准上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频语言模型在音乐理解方面面临挑战，主要因为音乐具有动态性、多层次性和信息密集性，且高质量音乐数据和标注稀缺。现有模型只能生成简短的高级描述，回答浅层问题，在不同音乐文化中泛化能力有限。

Method: 1) 构建MF-Skills大规模数据集，包含丰富的描述和问答对；2) 在增强的Audio Flamingo 3骨干网络上进行微调；3) 引入后训练方法：首先使用基于音乐理论的思维链数据集MF-Think进行冷启动，然后使用GRPO强化学习和定制奖励。

Result: 在10多个音乐理解和推理基准上取得了最先进的结果，展示了从表层识别向多层次、类人音乐感知的转变。

Conclusion: Music Flamingo为社区提供了基准和基础，推动下一代模型能够像人类一样有意义地参与音乐理解。

Abstract: We introduce Music Flamingo, a novel large audio-language model designed to advance music (including song) understanding in foundational audio models. While audio-language research has progressed rapidly, music remains challenging due to its dynamic, layered, and information-dense nature. Progress has been further limited by the difficulty of scaling open audio understanding models, primarily because of the scarcity of high-quality music data and annotations. As a result, prior models are restricted to producing short, high-level captions, answering only surface-level questions, and showing limited generalization across diverse musical cultures. To address these challenges, we curate MF-Skills, a large-scale dataset labeled through a multi-stage pipeline that yields rich captions and question-answer pairs covering harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context. We fine-tune an enhanced Audio Flamingo 3 backbone on MF-Skills and further strengthen multiple skills relevant to music understanding. To improve the model's reasoning abilities, we introduce a post-training recipe: we first cold-start with MF-Think, a novel chain-of-thought dataset grounded in music theory, followed by GRPO-based reinforcement learning with custom rewards. Music Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art results across 10+ benchmarks for music understanding and reasoning, establishing itself as a generalist and musically intelligent audio-language model. Beyond strong empirical results, Music Flamingo sets a new standard for advanced music understanding by demonstrating how models can move from surface-level recognition toward layered, human-like perception of songs. We believe this work provides both a benchmark and a foundation for the community to build the next generation of models that engage with music as meaningfully as humans do.

*Tianlei Chen,Yuxiao Chen,Yang Li,Feifei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于有向二分图编码器的自动化ICD编码方法，通过建模常见代码与罕见代码之间的细粒度共现关系，利用LLM生成代码描述来增强嵌入表示，在长尾分布下显著提升了Macro-F1性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化ICD编码面临大规模标签空间（1万-2万个代码）和长尾分布的挑战，许多罕见代码缺乏足够的训练数据，需要有效利用代码间的共现关系来提升罕见代码的分类性能。

Method: 构建有向二分图编码器，将代码分为常见和罕见两类节点，边仅从常见代码指向罕见代码。基于条件概率定义连接偏置，通过共现编码将偏置注入注意力模块，利用LLM生成代码描述来增强初始嵌入表示。

Result: 在三个自动化ICD编码基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能，特别是在长尾分类的关键指标Macro-F1上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过建模代码间的细粒度共现关系，结合LLM提供的临床上下文信息，能够有效提升自动化ICD编码的性能，特别是在处理长尾分布中的罕见代码时效果显著。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding aims to assign multiple disease codes to clinical documents, constituting a crucial multi-label text classification task in healthcare informatics. However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system. Experiments on three automated ICD coding benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, which is the key metric for long-tail classification.

TL;DR: OutSafe-Bench是首个面向多模态时代的最全面内容安全评估测试套件，包含18,000+双语文本提示、4,500张图像、450个音频和450个视频，涵盖9个关键内容风险类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型在日常工具和智能代理中的集成日益增多，对其可能输出不安全内容（如有毒语言、偏见图像、隐私侵犯和有害错误信息）的担忧不断增长。现有安全基准在模态覆盖和性能评估方面高度有限。

Method: 提出OutSafe-Bench测试套件，包括大规模多模态数据集、多维交叉风险评分(MCRS)新指标，以及FairScore可解释自动多评审加权聚合框架。

Result: 对9个最先进MLLM的评估揭示了持续且显著的安全漏洞，突显了在MLLM中建立强大安全防护的迫切需求。

Conclusion: 该工作强调了多模态模型安全评估的重要性，并为该领域提供了首个全面的评估框架，揭示了当前模型在内容安全方面的严重不足。

Abstract: Since Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly being integrated into everyday tools and intelligent agents, growing concerns have arisen regarding their possible output of unsafe contents, ranging from toxic language and biased imagery to privacy violations and harmful misinformation. Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的自主智能体开发方法成本高昂且效率低下，需要手动构建任务数据集和强化学习流程，导致数据构建成本高、探索效率低、样本利用率差。

Method: 提出AgentEvolver系统，包含三个协同机制：自我提问（好奇心驱动的任务生成）、自我导航（经验重用和混合策略指导提高探索效率）、自我归因（基于贡献度分配差异化奖励提高样本效率）。

Result: 初步实验表明，AgentEvolver相比传统基于强化学习的基线方法，实现了更高效的探索、更好的样本利用率和更快的适应能力。

Conclusion: AgentEvolver通过集成三种自进化机制，实现了智能体能力的可扩展、成本效益和持续改进。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance human productivity by reasoning, using tools, and executing complex tasks in diverse environments. However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

TL;DR: LayerNorm在Pre-LayerNorm模型中稳定学习，在Post-LayerNorm模型中影响记忆化；移除LayerNorm参数会加剧Pre-LayerNorm的记忆化并破坏学习稳定性，但能缓解Post-LayerNorm的记忆化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LayerNorm在Pre-和Post-LayerNorm transformers中对学习和记忆化的影响，目前这方面的作用尚不明确。

Method: 通过分析13个模型在6个视觉和语言数据集上的表现，研究LayerNorm参数对Pre-和Post-LayerNorm架构的影响，特别关注早期层LayerNorm的作用。

Result: 发现LayerNorm是Pre-LayerNorm模型稳定学习的关键因素，而在Post-LayerNorm模型中主要影响记忆化；早期层LayerNorm最为关键。

Conclusion: LayerNorm在transformer中塑造记忆化和学习的作用因架构不同而异，这些发现为理解LayerNorm的作用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化决策系统依赖静态规则或参与度最大化启发式方法，忽视了用户的情感背景和伦理约束，可能导致推荐不敏感或不安全的干预措施。

Method: 将个性化问题建模为约束马尔可夫决策过程(CMDP)，引入多目标奖励函数平衡短期行为参与和长期用户福祉，使用情感感知状态表示捕捉情绪波动。

Conclusion: 该框架在机器学习策略优化中实现了同理心和责任，为行为健康、教育和数字治疗等领域的人本系统提供了方法论基础。

Abstract: Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.

Trained and evaluated on ROCO, our model achieves state-of-the-art semantic fidelity while remaining compact and interpretable. We report results as mean$\pm$std over three seeds and include $95\%$ confidence intervals. Compared with baselines, our approach improves ROUGE (proposed 0.603, ResNet-CNN 0.356, BLIP2-OPT 0.255) and BERTScore (proposed 0.807, BLIP2-OPT 0.645, ResNet-CNN 0.623), with competitive BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR. We further provide ablations (regional attention on/off and token-count sweep), per-modality analysis (CT/MRI/X-ray), paired significance tests, and qualitative heatmaps that visualize the regions driving each description. Decoding uses beam search (beam size $=4$), length penalty $=1.1$, $no\_repeat\_ngram\_size$ $=3$, and max length $=128$. The proposed design yields accurate, clinically phrased captions and transparent regional attributions, supporting safe research use with a human in the loop.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 顺序微调预训练ViT虽然对类增量学习有效，但存在分布漂移问题，导致先前学习类的特征分布与更新模型不匹配，影响分类器性能。

Method: 引入潜在空间转换算子，提出线性SLDC（通过正则化最小二乘学习线性映射）和弱非线性SLDC（平衡线性和非线性变换），并结合知识蒸馏减少表示漂移。

Result: 在标准CIL基准测试中，SLDC显著提升SeqFT性能，结合KD后达到与联合训练相当的性能水平。

Conclusion: SLDC通过补偿分布漂移有效解决了顺序微调的核心问题，使SeqFT成为类增量学习的强大方法。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that sequential fine-tuning (SeqFT) of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs), followed by classifier refinement using approximate distributions of class features, can be an effective strategy for class-incremental learning (CIL). However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at understanding and generating video descriptions but their high memory, computation, and deployment demands hinder practical use particularly for blind and low-vision (BLV) users who depend on detailed, context-aware descriptions. To study the effect of model size on accessibility-focused description quality, we evaluate SmolVLM2 variants with 500M and 2.2B parameters across two diverse datasets: AVCaps (outdoor), and Charades (indoor). In this work, we introduce two novel evaluation frameworks specifically designed for BLV accessibility assessment: the Multi-Context BLV Framework evaluating spatial orientation, social interaction, action events, and ambience contexts; and the Navigational Assistance Framework focusing on mobility-critical information. Additionally, we conduct a systematic evaluation of four different prompt design strategies and deploy both models on a smartphone, evaluating FP32 and INT8 precision variants to assess real-world performance constraints on resource-limited mobile devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社交媒体上错误信息的传播机制，特别是人类认知偏见、情绪和身份驱动推理如何放大错误信息，需要一种可解释的方法来模拟和分析这些过程。

Method: 建立LLM代理网络模型，每个代理基于特定角色重写接收的内容，通过问答式审计器在每一步追踪事实保真度，定义错误信息指数和传播率来量化事实退化。

Result: 实验显示身份和意识形态驱动的代理在政治、营销和技术领域加速错误信息传播，而专家型代理保持事实稳定；早期失真出现后，异质代理交互会迅速将错误信息升级为宣传级失真。

Conclusion: LLM既能模拟人类偏见，又能作为审计器追踪信息保真度，该框架为研究和缓解数字生态系统中的错误信息传播提供了可解释的实证方法。

Abstract: Misinformation on social media thrives on surprise, emotion, and identity-driven reasoning, often amplified through human cognitive biases. To investigate these mechanisms, we model large language model (LLM) personas as synthetic agents that mimic user-level biases, ideological alignments, and trust heuristics. Within this setup, we introduce an auditor--node framework to simulate and analyze how misinformation evolves as it circulates through networks of such agents. News articles are propagated across networks of persona-conditioned LLM nodes, each rewriting received content. A question--answering-based auditor then measures factual fidelity at every step, offering interpretable, claim-level tracking of misinformation drift. We formalize a misinformation index and a misinformation propagation rate to quantify factual degradation across homogeneous and heterogeneous branches of up to 30 sequential rewrites. Experiments with 21 personas across 10 domains reveal that identity- and ideology-based personas act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, marketing, and technology. By contrast, expert-driven personas preserve factual stability. Controlled-random branch simulations further show that once early distortions emerge, heterogeneous persona interactions rapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion. Our taxonomy of misinformation severity -- spanning factual errors, lies, and propaganda -- connects observed drift to established theories in misinformation studies. These findings demonstrate the dual role of LLMs as both proxies for human-like biases and as auditors capable of tracing information fidelity. The proposed framework provides an interpretable, empirically grounded approach for studying, simulating, and mitigating misinformation diffusion in digital ecosystems.

TL;DR: MuSeR通过自我评估和精炼的方法提升LLM在医疗领域的上下文感知能力，在HealthBench基准上显著提升性能，特别是上下文感知方面，并创造了新的SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在医疗领域基准测试表现良好，但在真实场景中缺乏上下文感知能力，无法识别缺失或关键细节，难以提供安全、有帮助且上下文适当的响应。

Method: 提出多层面自我精炼(MuSeR)方法：1)属性条件查询生成器模拟多样化用户上下文；2)LLM响应查询并沿三个关键层面(决策、沟通、安全)自我评估；3)精炼响应以更好对齐各层面要求；4)使用查询和精炼响应进行监督微调。

Result: 在HealthBench数据集上显著提升LLM性能，特别是在上下文感知轴线上。通过知识蒸馏，较小的骨干LLM(Qwen3-32B)性能超过其教师模型，在HealthBench上达到63.8%，其困难子集达到43.1%，创造了开源LLM的新SOTA。

Conclusion: MuSeR有效提升了LLM在医疗领域的上下文感知能力，通过自我评估和精炼机制使模型能更好适应真实医疗场景的需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.

Conclusion: ProgRAG通过渐进式推理路径扩展和不确定性感知证据剪枝，有效解决了KG增强LLM中的检索和推理失败问题，显著提升了多跳知识图谱问答的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.

Abstract: Fake news detection methods based on writing style have achieved remarkable progress. However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of agent architectures and effectively identifying problematic agents when failures occur are crucial challenges in multi-agent systems (MAS). Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\% fault rate). Notably, our approach surpasses traditional methods by attaining remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in both mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.
