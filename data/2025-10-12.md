### [1] [Inconsistent Affective Reaction: Sentiment of Perception and Opinion in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07359)
*Jingfei Huang,Han Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种新方法来识别城市环境中感知与意见之间的情感不一致，通过街景图像和社交媒体文本分析北京二环地区的情感反应变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台的兴起改变了我们对城市环境的理解，产生了嵌入在人类感知和意见中的情感反应细微变化，这对现有的多维情感分析方法提出了挑战。

Method: 构建包含140,750张街景图像和984,024条微博文本的数据集，开发反应指数整合目标检测和自然语言处理技术，使用回归分析、图像分割和词频分析来分类和分析情感反应。

Result: 感知情感反应趋势图显示正向情感分布更均匀，而意见情感反应趋势图显示更极端的变化。不匹配图显示人类感知与意见之间存在显著差异，情感变化与密集建筑和行人存在等元素有显著关系。

Conclusion: 不一致图展示了疫情前后的感知和意见情感，为环境管理和城市更新策略制定提供了潜在解释和方向。

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

### [2] [Haystack Engineering: Context Engineering for Heterogeneous and Agentic Long-Context Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07414)
*Mufei Li,Dongqi Fu,Limei Wang,Si Zhang,Hanqing Zeng,Kaan Sancak,Ruizhong Qiu,Haoyu Wang,Xiaoxin He,Xavier Bresson,Yinglong Xia,Chonglin Sun,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HaystackCraft基准，通过构建包含异构检索器偏差和智能体级联错误的噪声长上下文，评估大语言模型的长上下文鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的"大海捞针"基准过于理想化，忽略了现实世界中检索器偏差和智能体工作流产生的噪声上下文对模型性能的影响。

Method: 基于英文维基百科超链接网络构建HaystackCraft基准，包含多跳问题，评估异构检索策略对干扰项组成和LLM性能的影响，并扩展到动态智能体设置。

Result: 实验发现：1）更强的密集检索器会引入更具挑战性的干扰项，而基于图的重新排序能同时提高检索效果并减轻有害干扰；2）在智能体测试中，即使是先进模型也会因自生成干扰项而出现级联失败或难以提前停止。

Conclusion: 智能体长上下文推理仍面临持续挑战，HaystackCraft为未来进展提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

### [3] [Lemma Dilemma: On Lemma Generation Without Domain- or Language-Specific Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07434)
*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文实证研究了大语言模型在上下文词形还原任务中的表现，与传统监督方法进行比较，发现在多数语言中LLM通过少量示例即可达到最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在多种NLP任务中表现出色，但在上下文词形还原任务中的有效性尚未得到验证，特别是在目标领域或语言缺乏监督训练数据的情况下。

Method: 比较了(i)在域外微调的编码器监督方法，(ii)跨语言方法，以及(iii)LLM直接上下文生成词形的方法，在12种不同形态复杂度的语言上进行实验。

Result: 实验发现，虽然编码器在域外设置下使用黄金数据微调仍具竞争力，但当前LLM通过直接上下文生成词形，仅需少量示例即可在大多数语言中达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在上下文词形还原任务中表现出色，无需先验微调即可在多数语言中达到最优性能，为低资源语言的词形还原提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

### [4] [LASER: An LLM-based ASR Scoring and Evaluation Rubric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07437)
*Amruta Parulekar,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的ASR评估指标LASER，通过上下文学习解决传统WER指标对形态和句法差异的过度惩罚问题，在印地语上达到94%的人类标注相关性，并能泛化到其他印度语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR评估指标如WER对不影响语义的形态和句法差异惩罚过重，需要更智能的评估方法。

Method: 利用先进LLM的上下文学习能力，通过包含详细示例的提示学习评分标准；同时探索使用较小LLM在词对示例上微调来预测惩罚程度。

Result: 使用Gemini 2.5 Pro的印地语LASER评分与人类标注相关性达94%；在马拉地语、卡纳达语和马拉雅拉姆语上同样有效；微调Llama 3预测惩罚准确率接近89%。

Conclusion: LLM-based方法能有效解决ASR评估中的语义感知问题，LASER指标在多种印度语言上表现优异，较小模型的微调也显示出良好潜力。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

*Zifan Jiang,Colin Leong,Amit Moryossef,Anne Göhring,Annette Rios,Oliver Cory,Maksym Ivashechkin,Neha Tarigopula,Biao Zhang,Rico Sennrich,Sarah Ebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了基于人体骨骼姿态的手语表达评估方法，涵盖关键点距离、嵌入和回译三种指标，通过自动元评估和人工相关性研究揭示了不同场景下的指标权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为手语翻译或生成系统提供有意义且可复现的评估方法，解决手语表达评估的标准化问题。

Method: 使用关键点距离、嵌入和回译三种评估指标，通过自动元评估（手语级别检索）和人工相关性研究（跨语言文本到姿态翻译）进行验证。

Result: 揭示了不同评估指标在不同场景下的权衡关系，开发了开源姿态评估工具包。

Conclusion: 该研究为手语翻译和生成系统的开发与评估提供了实用且可复现的方法论和工具支持。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on meaningfully evaluating sign language
utterances in the form of human skeletal poses. The study covers keypoint
distance-based, embedding-based, and back-translation-based metrics. We show
tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios through automatic
meta-evaluation of sign-level retrieval and a human correlation study of
text-to-pose translation across different sign languages. Our findings and the
open-source pose-evaluation toolkit provide a practical and reproducible way of
developing and evaluating sign language translation or generation systems.

### [6] [Populism Meets AI: Advancing Populism Research with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07458)
*Eduardo Ryô Tamaki,Yujin J. Jung,Julia Chatterley,Grant Mitchell,Semir Dzebo,Cristóbal Sandoval,Levente Littvay,Kirk A. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用基于规则和锚点的思维链提示方法，通过LLM复制人类编码员训练过程，实现了与专家人类编码员相当的民粹主义分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于文本分析的民粹主义测量方法成本高、耗时长，难以跨语言、跨语境和大规模语料库扩展，需要更高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: 利用全球民粹主义数据库(GPD)，采用基于规则和锚点的思维链提示方法，通过向LLM提供与训练人类编码员相同的文档来指导模型推理。

Result: 该领域特定的提示策略使LLM在民粹主义分类准确率上达到与专家人类编码员相当的水平，能够处理民粹主义的细微、语境敏感方面。

Conclusion: 基于规则和锚点的思维链提示方法为大规模、多语言的民粹主义测量提供了可行的自动化解决方案，性能可与人类专家相媲美。

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

### [7] [MAPRO: Recasting Multi-Agent Prompt Optimization as Maximum a Posteriori Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07475)
*Zheyuan Zhang,Lin Ge,Hongjiang Li,Weicheng Zhu,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAPRO是一个多智能体提示优化框架，通过最大后验推理和信念传播算法，解决多智能体系统中提示优化的指数级搜索空间和信用分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统虽然能超越单智能体性能，但由于提示敏感性和系统不稳定性，设计有效的多智能体系统仍然困难。现有的自动提示设计方法主要关注单智能体，多智能体提示优化尚未充分探索。

Method: MAPRO采用四阶段框架：将多智能体提示优化建模为最大后验推理问题，使用语言引导的max-product信念传播算法求解，通过拓扑感知的细化机制整合执行反馈和下游责任，迭代更新智能体提示。

Result: 在多个任务基准测试中，MAPRO实现了最先进的性能，持续超越手动设计的基线和最近的自动化替代方案。

Conclusion: MAPRO不仅提升了多智能体系统的性能，其基于最大后验的公式化为未来构建更可靠、更原则化的多智能体系统提供了通用指导原则。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

### [8] [AsyncSpade: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Asynchronous Sparse Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07486)
*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade是一个异步框架，通过预测查询状态和解耦KV缓存过滤，在测试时缩放场景下显著提升LLM推理效率，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时缩放方法存在内存瓶颈和效率问题，特别是在高并发和长思维链场景下，查询感知的稀疏解码方法受到顺序依赖和粗粒度令牌选择的限制。

Method: 提出AsyncSpade框架，包含轻量级时序回归模块预测下一个令牌的查询状态，以及异步解耦框架将KV缓存过滤与自回归解码循环分离。

Result: 在A100节点上，AsyncSpade完全重叠KV缓存操作与推理流水线，相比SoTA基线Quest减少20%以上的TPOT，相比全注意力减少至少50%的TPOT，同时在多个TTS基准测试中保持或超越准确率。

Conclusion: AsyncSpade首次消除了顺序依赖而不牺牲模型性能，为高效TTS提供了理论最优的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

*Rasika Muralidharan,Jaewoon Kwak,Jisun An*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个多智能体框架来探索团队科学的核心方面：结构、多样性和互动动态，并在常识推理和社会推理任务上评估团队表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类团队科学的启发，研究LLM驱动的多智能体系统中的团队动态，因为目前较少有研究关注这一领域。

Method: 提出多智能体框架，评估团队在四个任务（CommonsenseQA、StrategyQA、Social IQa和Latent Implicit Hate）上的表现，涵盖常识和社会推理。

Result: 扁平化团队表现优于层级化团队，多样性影响复杂。智能体对团队表现过度自信，但任务后反思显示对合作的赞赏和整合挑战，包括有限的对话协调。

Conclusion: 多智能体团队在LLM驱动下展现出复杂的团队动态，扁平结构更有效，但存在协调和整合挑战。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

### [10] [Can Speech LLMs Think while Listening?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07497)
*Yi-Jen Shih,Desh Raj,Chunyang Wu,Wei Zhou,SK Bong,Yashesh Gaur,Jay Mahadeokar,Ozlem Kalinli,Mike Seltzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了思维链微调对多流语音大语言模型的影响，提出通过提前推理和DPO优化来平衡准确性与延迟的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型在处理复杂推理任务时表现不佳，而文本LLM中的思维链方法已被证明能显著提升推理能力。同时，语音交互中的响应延迟也是关键因素。

Method: 采用思维链微调方法，引入基于熵的"问题完整性"指标来指导模型在用户查询结束前开始推理，并使用DPO在偏好数据上进行优化。

Result: 思维链微调使语音LLM在口语推理任务上的准确率平均提升2.4倍；提前推理方法在同等延迟条件下在ARC-Easy上获得4%准确率提升；DPO优化实现了70%延迟降低且不损失准确率。

Conclusion: 思维链微调能显著提升语音LLM的推理能力，结合提前推理和DPO优化可以有效地平衡准确性与延迟，推动语音代理的实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

### [11] [When Thoughts Meet Facts: Reusable Reasoning for Long-Context LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07499)
*Soyeong Jeong,Taehee Jung,Sung Ju Hwang,Joo-Kyung Kim,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL)框架，通过可重用的思维模板指导长上下文语言模型进行多跳推理，解决了简单增加文档数量无法有效连接证据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长上下文语言模型虽然能处理大量文档，但仅仅将更多文档输入上下文窗口无法有效捕捉证据之间的连接方式，限制了多跳推理能力。

Method: 使用思维模板将推理重新构建为可重用的思维缓存，这些模板源自先前的问题解决轨迹，结构化证据组合方式并指导多跳推理。通过基于自然语言反馈的迭代更新策略来保持模板有效性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和不同LCLM模型家族中，该方法相比强基线模型在基于检索和无检索设置下均取得了持续的性能提升。优化后的模板可以蒸馏到更小的开源模型中。

Conclusion: ToTAL框架通过思维模板增强了长上下文语言模型的多跳推理能力，展示了广泛的适用性和透明的推理重用性。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

### [12] [ParsTranslit: Truly Versatile Tajik-Farsi Transliteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07520)
*Rayyan Merchant,Kevin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的波斯语-塔吉克语双向音译模型，通过整合所有可用数据集并创建两个新数据集，实现了跨领域的先进音译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语作为双语种语言，在阿富汗和伊朗使用波斯-阿拉伯字母，在塔吉克斯坦使用塔吉克-西里尔字母。虽然各国方言相似，但文字差异阻碍了塔吉克斯坦与其他波斯语国家的书面交流。现有音译模型大多局限于特定领域，缺乏实际应用的多样性。

Method: 开发了一个新的序列到序列模型，整合了所有可用数据集进行训练，并创建了两个新数据集，实现了跨领域的音译能力。

Result: 模型在从波斯语到塔吉克语的音译中达到chrF++ 87.91和标准化CER 0.05，从塔吉克语到波斯语达到chrF++ 92.28和标准化CER 0.04，在所有可用数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了对波斯语-塔吉克语音译任务更清晰的理解，建立了全面的基准，模型、数据和代码均已公开，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ParsTranslit-FB30/.

### [13] [OWL: Overcoming Window Length-Dependence in Speculative Decoding for Long-Context Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07535)
*Jaeseong Lee,seung-won hwang,Aurick Qiao,Gabriele Oliaro,Ye Wang,Samyam Rajbhandari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OWL的新型推测解码方法，专门针对长上下文场景，通过LSTM-based drafter、特殊token [SPEC]和混合算法实现了比现有方法更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法在短上下文（如2K tokens）上表现良好，但在实际应用中的长上下文场景下性能严重下降，甚至可能减慢生成速度。

Method: 1. 使用基于LSTM的drafter，仅依赖最后一个token状态，使其能泛化到各种长度；2. 在验证器中引入特殊token [SPEC]为drafter提供更丰富的表示；3. 结合树解码和非树解码的混合算法。

Result: OWL在长上下文输入上实现了比EAGLE3约5倍更高的接受长度，显著提升了长上下文下的生成速度。

Conclusion: OWL方法有效解决了现有推测解码方法在长上下文场景下的局限性，并发布了LongSpecBench基准测试和所有代码数据集以推动未来研究。

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

TL;DR: 提出了两种方法提升小型视觉语言模型在图表理解任务中的评估能力：多标准提示和领域自适应迁移学习，创建了ChartJudge模型，在资源受限环境下实现高效评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型视觉语言模型（≤2B参数）在图表理解任务中作为自动评估器表现不佳的问题，使其能在资源受限环境中实用。

Method: 采用多标准提示将多个评估标准合并到单个查询中，以及通过领域自适应迁移学习在图表数据集上微调2B参数模型，创建ChartJudge模型。

Result: 多标准提示暴露了7B模型的鲁棒性缺陷，ChartJudge能够有效在不同数据集间迁移知识，成为更专业的模型。

Conclusion: 通过模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间的权衡分析，为图表推理任务提供了可扩展、低成本的评估解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出基于任务主LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，解决轻量级BERT编码器在移动设备上部署时多任务优化冲突问题，在21个下游任务上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动平台部署NLP模型需要模型既能适应多样化应用，又能保持内存和计算效率。研究如何增强轻量级BERT编码器在命名实体识别和文本分类两个基础NLP任务家族中的适应性。

Method: 提出基于任务主LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，使用单一共享编码器骨干网络和模块化适配器，避免朴素多任务预微调带来的优化冲突。

Result: 在21个下游任务上，命名实体识别平均提升0.8%，文本分类平均提升8.8%，性能与单独预微调相当，同时满足实际部署约束。

Conclusion: 该方法为多功能移动NLP应用提供了有效的解决方案，能够在保持部署效率的同时提升模型适应性。

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

TL;DR: 通过计算语言学分析疫情相关网络话语，发现健康错误信息在可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言使用上与事实性内容存在显著差异，错误信息采用复杂修辞风格嵌入情感线索以增强可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在识别健康错误信息与事实性沟通的语言特征差异，为数字健康错误信息检测提供语言学指标，并指导公共卫生信息策略。

Method: 使用三个语料库：COVID-19错误叙述、一般COVID-19内容和猴痘相关帖子，分析可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言使用的差异。

Result: COVID-19错误信息的可读性得分显著较低，恐惧相关或说服性术语频率是其他数据集的两倍以上，感叹号使用最少，与猴痘内容的情绪化风格形成对比。

Conclusion: 错误信息采用故意复杂的修辞风格嵌入情感线索，可能增强其感知可信度。研究为健康错误信息检测提供了语言学指标，但存在依赖传统可读性指数等局限性，未来研究应纳入纵向设计和更广泛的情感词典。

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用LLMs作为工具开发构造语言的系统，通过模块化流程创建语音学模型、生成语法标记语料、构建词典、设计正字法，并最终生成语法手册。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双重目标：一是为人工构造语言创作提供有趣工具；二是探索LLMs对语言和语言学概念的理解程度，以及在不同语言模式和资源条件下的能力差异。

Method: 模块化系统：1) 代理方法创建目标语音学模型；2) 将英语句子'翻译'为反映目标语言词序和形态句法特征的标记；3) 从语料中提取词素构建词典；4) 设计正字法；5) 编写语法手册。

Result: 不同LLMs和语言规范之间存在显著能力差异，处理常见模式比罕见模式更容易。在将高资源语言翻译为低资源语言的应用中，目前结果多为负面，但改进版本可能带来实际收益。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了LLMs在语言构造方面的潜力，同时揭示了其在处理不同语言模式时的能力局限，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究使用表征相似性分析探索了语言模型输入词汇表征的结构及其在训练过程中的演变，发现词汇嵌入几何快速收敛到与语义和句法特征高度相关，且高频词和功能词比低频词收敛更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型输入词汇表征的结构特征，以及这些结构在训练过程中如何演变，特别是词汇嵌入几何与语义、句法特征的关系。

Method: 使用表征相似性分析，对Pythia 12B和OLMo 7B两个开源模型的输入和输出嵌入进行几何结构分析，关联语义、句法和频率指标在训练过程中的变化。

Result: 1) 词汇嵌入几何在训练中快速收敛到与语义和句法特征高度相关；2) 高频词和功能词比词汇词和低频词更快收敛到最终向量。

Conclusion: 词汇几何围绕语言结构的动态轨迹揭示了词频和功能的不同作用，为研究词汇几何演变如何促进模型能力提升提供了动机。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

TL;DR: LLMs在临床编码任务中表现不佳，主要问题是预测代码在层次结构上接近但错误。通过轻量级干预和引入临床代码验证任务，可以显著提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的临床编码对医疗文档、计费和决策至关重要，现有LLMs在此任务上表现不佳，且传统评估指标忽略了层次结构接近的错误。

Method: 使用轻量级干预（包括提示工程和小规模微调），引入临床代码验证作为独立任务和流水线组件，并发布专家双重标注的门诊临床笔记基准数据集。

Result: 层次结构错位占LLM失败的主要部分，验证被证明是提高基于LLM的医疗编码的有效可靠步骤。

Conclusion: 临床代码验证是改进LLM医疗编码性能的关键方法，轻量级干预可以显著提高准确性而不需要计算密集的搜索方法。

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了语言模型在访问控制策略下的拒绝行为，通过扩展Spider和BIRD数据集添加PostgreSQL角色策略，比较了三种方法：提示、两步验证管道和LoRA微调，发现显式验证能提高拒绝精度，微调在安全性和实用性间取得更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生不受限制的响应，模糊了角色边界，需要研究其在访问控制策略下的拒绝能力，确保在授权时回答，未授权时拒绝。

Method: 创建了扩展Spider和BIRD数据集的新数据集，添加了表级和列级的PostgreSQL角色策略，比较了三种设计：零/少样本提示、两步生成器-验证器管道、LoRA微调模型。

Result: 显式验证（两步框架）提高了拒绝精度并降低了错误许可，微调在安全性和实用性（执行准确性）之间取得了更好的平衡，更长更复杂的策略降低了所有系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: 显式验证和微调都能改善语言模型的访问控制行为，但复杂策略会降低可靠性，发布了RBAC增强数据集和代码。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

Motivation: 传统银行界面使用刚性多屏幕工作流程，而现有AI助手仅限于咨询或支持角色。本文旨在开发一个监管批准的、能够可靠执行核心金融操作的自然语言界面。

Method: 构建完全内部的Ryt AI框架，使用内部开发的闭源LLM ILMU，通过四个LLM驱动的代理（护栏、意图、支付和FAQ）协调对话，每个代理使用任务特定的LoRA适配器，并在银行基础设施内托管以确保一致行为。

Result: 成功部署了全球首个监管机构批准的对话AI作为主要银行界面，能够可靠支持核心金融操作，并提供了深度防御的安全和合规保障。

Conclusion: Ryt AI证明了在严格治理下，监管批准的自然语言界面可以可靠地支持核心金融操作，实现了"正确完成的银行业务"。

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OBCache是一个基于结构化剪枝理论的KV缓存淘汰框架，通过量化token对注意力输出的影响来优化缓存管理，相比基于启发式注意力权重的现有方法能提升长上下文准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的长上下文窗口导致KV缓存内存开销巨大，现有缓存淘汰方法仅基于累积注意力权重进行启发式排序，未考虑token对注意力输出的真实影响。

Method: 将缓存淘汰建模为分层结构化剪枝问题，基于Optimal Brain Damage理论推导闭式解来量化token重要性，考虑注意力权重、值状态和注意力输出的综合影响。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上的实验表明，用OBCache的输出感知分数替换现有方法的启发式分数能持续提升长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: OBCache提供了一个原则性的缓存淘汰框架，通过输出感知的重要性评估改进了现有方法，在保持性能的同时减少了内存开销。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的token概率偏见评估方法虽然应用广泛，但被认为与现实语言模型使用场景和危害存在距离，需要探索更现实的替代评估指标。

Method: 测试自然语言推理(NLI)作为更现实的偏见评估指标，并与token概率(TP)方法进行对比分析。

Result: NLI和TP偏见评估行为差异显著，相关性很低；NLI更易检测"去偏见不足"的情况，但对反刻板印象句子措辞更敏感脆弱。

Conclusion: token概率和自然语言推理都不是在所有情况下"更好"的偏见指标，建议结合TP、NLI和下游偏见评估来确保语言模型的全面评估。

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型的行为规范和伦理原则面临内部冲突和覆盖不足的挑战，需要系统化方法来识别和解决这些问题。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别模型规范中的系统性缺陷，为改进模型行为规范提供了实证基础，并揭示了不同模型的价值优先模式差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测模型主要依赖表面语言线索，难以有效泛化到多样化的风格变化。不同平台的仇恨言论针对不同群体并采用独特风格，可能诱导与标签的虚假相关性。

Method: 将仇恨言论生成建模为包含上下文环境、创作者动机、目标和风格等关键因素的因果图，提出CADET因果表征学习框架，解构仇恨言论为可解释潜在因素并控制混杂变量。

Result: CADET在综合实验中表现出优越性能，突显了因果先验在推进可泛化仇恨言论检测方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 因果图指导的表示学习能够有效隔离真正的仇恨意图与表面语言线索，通过反事实推理使模型能够稳健识别各种形式的仇恨言论。

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

TL;DR: MemWeaver是一个将用户文本历史编织成分层记忆的框架，通过行为记忆和认知记忆两个互补组件来捕捉用户兴趣的时空演化，实现深度个性化生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户与互联网的交互形式正从隐式反馈转向显式文本交互，这为深度个性化提供了机会。但现有方法仅将用户历史视为扁平文本列表进行检索，无法建模反映用户兴趣动态变化的丰富时空结构。

Method: 提出MemWeaver框架，构建包含行为记忆和认知记忆的双组件分层记忆系统。行为记忆捕捉具体用户行为，认知记忆表示长期偏好，两者都整合了时间和语义信息但在不同抽象层次。

Result: 在LaMP基准测试上的实验验证了MemWeaver的有效性。

Conclusion: MemWeaver通过分层记忆结构成功捕捉了用户兴趣的时空演化，为LLM提供了统一的用户表示，使其能够同时推理具体行为和抽象特征，实现了深度个性化生成。

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)
benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is

TL;DR: SubQRAG是一个基于子问题驱动的图检索增强生成框架，通过将复杂问题分解为可验证的子问题链，动态扩展知识图谱，构建可追溯的图记忆来提升多跳问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图RAG方法虽然能构建知识图谱连接分散事实，但缺乏深度结构化推理能力，导致复杂多跳问答中证据不完整和错误累积。

Method: 将复杂问题分解为有序子问题链，为每个子问题检索相关三元组，当现有图谱不足时动态从源文档提取新三元组，构建图记忆作为结构化证据路径。

Result: 在三个多跳问答基准测试中，SubQRAG实现了持续且显著的性能提升，特别是在精确匹配分数方面。

Conclusion: 子问题驱动的图RAG框架能有效增强推理深度，通过结构化证据路径提升复杂问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

Motivation: GRPO训练LLM时面临模型准确率低、小规模架构表现差的问题，导致性能提升有限、训练中期崩溃，影响了稳定性和最终效果。

Method: ToolExpander框架包含：(1)动态多轮硬采样：用高质量少样本演示替换困难样本，结合指数学习率衰减；(2)自示例思维：去除KL散度，调整裁剪系数，通过微小奖励(0.01)鼓励模型自主生成分析少样本示例。

Conclusion: ToolExpander通过创新的训练策略有效解决了GRPO训练中的关键问题，为资源受限的LLM提供了更稳定高效的工具导向强化学习方案。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

Conclusion: 这项工作为连续空间中的可扩展推理开辟了新方向，实现了潜在推理模型的并行测试时扩展。

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在多项选择题中的真实推理策略，特别是当它们仅基于选项就能成功答题时，这种部分输入的成功是否总是问题。

Method: 让带有推理功能的LLMs在完整输入和仅选项输入两种情况下解答MCQs，分析推理轨迹的忠实度和策略。

Result: 测试时推理在完整输入和约一半的仅选项情况下提高准确率；仅选项的成功几乎不受推理轨迹长度影响；推理轨迹通过了忠实度测试，显示使用了推断缺失问题等较少问题的策略。

Conclusion: 部分输入的成功并不总是缺陷，推理轨迹可以帮助区分有问题的数据和较少问题的推理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

TL;DR: 本文发现基于结果的奖励在数学推理中容易导致奖励欺骗，模型会通过不合理的推理过程得到正确答案。作者提出了过程导向的Rubric奖励模型，通过评估整个推理轨迹来提升模型的可靠性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于结果的奖励方法在数学推理中存在严重问题，模型经常通过不合理的推理过程得到正确答案，导致对模型推理能力的高估。这种'奖励欺骗'现象使得模型不可靠。

Method: 提出了Rubric奖励模型(RRM)，这是一种过程导向的奖励函数，通过问题特定的评分标准来评估整个推理轨迹。RRM提供细粒度的校准奖励(0-1)，明确惩罚逻辑缺陷并鼓励严谨推导。

Result: 在四个数学基准测试中，基于RRM的训练始终优于仅基于结果的监督方法。在AIME2024上，Verified Pass@1024从26.7%提升到62.6%，奇迹步骤的发生率减少了71%。

Conclusion: 奖励解决方案过程对于构建不仅更准确而且更可靠的模型至关重要。过程导向的奖励方法能够显著减少奖励欺骗现象，提升模型的推理可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了LLM中真实性和安全性的权衡问题，在提高事实准确性的同时保持安全对齐

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Motivation: 现实世界中的LLM部署需要持续的多轮交互，但存在上下文漂移问题，即模型输出逐渐偏离目标一致行为，而现有静态评估指标无法很好地捕捉这种时间性漂移。

Method: 将漂移形式化为测试模型与目标一致参考模型之间逐轮KL散度，提出一个递归模型将漂移演化解释为具有恢复力和可控干预的有界随机过程。

Result: 实验显示漂移呈现出稳定的、噪声限制的均衡状态而非失控退化，简单的提醒干预能可靠地减少漂移，符合理论预测。

Conclusion: 多轮漂移可被理解为可控的均衡现象而非不可避免的衰减，为研究和缓解扩展交互中的上下文漂移提供了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

Conclusion: 结合旋转约束更新和方差感知重要性评分的方法能够有效补偿剪枝误差，同时以几何保持的方式保留更重要的组件。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Agentic RAG技术存在过度搜索和搜索不足的问题，导致不必要的开销和不可靠输出。当前基于结果奖励的强化学习方法缺乏细粒度控制来解决这些效率问题。

Method: 引入分层过程奖励方法，将代理的推理轨迹分解为离散可解析步骤，实时评估每个搜索决策的必要性，在常用的结果和格式奖励基础上，基于最优搜索和非搜索步骤比例提供额外奖励。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型上的七个QA基准测试中，平均准确率达到65.4%(3B)和67.2%(7B)，同时将过度搜索率降至2.3%，并降低了搜索不足率。

Conclusion: HiPRAG证明了通过强化学习进行细粒度控制的重要性，能够提高搜索代理的推理效率和最优性，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

TL;DR: 提出了GTD框架，通过条件离散图扩散模型迭代生成多智能体系统的通信拓扑结构，实现任务自适应、稀疏且高效的拓扑设计


<details>

Motivation: 多智能体系统的效率高度依赖通信拓扑，但设计最优拓扑面临性能、通信成本和鲁棒性之间的平衡挑战，现有静态拓扑无法适应多样化任务需求

Method: GTD框架将拓扑合成建模为迭代构建过程，使用轻量级代理模型预测多目标奖励（准确性、效用、成本），实现实时、无梯度的任务自适应拓扑优化

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证，GTD能生成高度任务自适应、稀疏且高效的通信拓扑，显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: GTD框架通过迭代引导的拓扑合成过程，能够更好地处理复杂设计权衡，为LLM驱动的多智能体系统提供有效的通信拓扑优化方案

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

Motivation: 生成式信息检索在单语言场景表现优异，但在多语言检索中面临跨语言标识符不对齐和标识符膨胀两大挑战。

Method: 提出MGR-CSC框架，将语义等价的多语言关键词统一为共享原子以对齐语义并压缩标识符空间，采用动态多步约束解码策略进行检索。

Result: 在mMarco100k和mNQ320k数据集上分别提升检索准确率6.83%和4.77%，同时将文档标识符长度减少74.51%和78.2%。

Conclusion: MGR-CSC通过跨语言语义压缩有效解决了多语言生成式检索的标识符不对齐和膨胀问题，显著提升了检索准确率和解码效率。

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出AdaSwitch方法，在token级别动态结合on-policy和off-policy生成，解决小语言模型知识蒸馏中的训练-推理不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在严格延迟和计算约束下性能提升困难，现有知识蒸馏方法存在权衡：off-policy蒸馏提供高质量监督但引入训练-推理不匹配，on-policy方法保持一致性但依赖低质量学生输出。

Method: AdaSwitch方法在token级别动态组合on-policy和off-policy生成，让学生先探索自身预测，然后基于实时质量评估选择性整合教师指导。

Result: 在三个数据集和两个教师-学生LLM对上的实验表明，AdaSwitch持续提高准确性，为蒸馏小语言模型提供了实用有效的方法，且额外开销可接受。

Conclusion: AdaSwitch同时保持了一致性和监督质量，为小语言模型的知识蒸馏提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Conclusion: Translation Tangles为评估LLM翻译质量和公平性提供了系统化工具，有助于解决翻译中的偏见和不均衡问题。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

Motivation: 长链思维推理模型在复杂任务中表现优异，但存在过度思考问题——即使简单查询也会进行不必要的冗长推理，造成计算资源浪费且无精度提升。现有研究缺乏对过度思考根本原因的深入理解。

Method: 开发TRACE工具：1) 将思维过程分解为最小完整子思维；2) 推断子思维间的话语关系，构建细粒度思维进展图；3) 识别主题相似查询的常见思维模式。

Result: 发现长思维模型在简单任务上速度慢5-20倍且无实质性精度提升。识别出两种主要思维模式——探索者和晚着陆，证明过度验证和过度探索是过度思考的主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 提出了基于效用的过度思考定义，超越基于长度的度量，为理解LLM思维进展和原则性过度思考管理提供了更深刻的理解和实践指导。

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended
understanding rate from 64.5% to 86.5%, and significantly reduces pronunciation
errors in the secondary language. CS3-Bench is available at

<details>

Motivation: 弱到强泛化方法虽然有望扩展大型语言模型，但受到弱模型输出中的噪声和偏差的限制，影响了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 利用隐式奖励（通过对数似然比近似显式奖励）与对比解码的结构等价性，提出ConG框架，在前后对齐的弱模型之间进行对比解码来生成更高质量的样本。

Result: 在不同模型家族上的实证结果表明，ConG能够带来一致的改进，实现更可靠的能力转移、去噪和提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ConG有潜力推进弱到强泛化方法，为通向AGI提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

Motivation: 方言主要是口语形式，非标准拼写在文本处理中存在问题，需要研究从标准语言到方言的迁移效果。

Method: 在德语和多个德语方言的书面和口语意图分类任务中，比较了文本模型、语音模型以及语音转录后再处理的级联系统。

Result: 语音模型在方言数据上表现最佳，文本模型在标准数据上表现最好。级联系统在德语上落后于文本模型，但在方言数据上如果转录系统生成标准化的输出则表现相对较好。

Conclusion: 语音模型是处理方言数据的最佳选择，而级联系统在特定条件下也能在方言数据上取得不错的效果。

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在多跳事实回忆中表现显著衰减，特别是在涉及推理链中隐含中间主题时。

Method: 通过因果分析发现隐含主题作为查询神经元，在Transformer层中顺序激活对应值神经元；提出ACE框架利用神经元级归因识别和编辑这些关键Q-V通路。

Result: 在GPT-J上比现有最优方法提升9.44%，在Qwen3-8B上提升37.46%；进一步揭示了Qwen3中更细粒度的激活模式。

Conclusion: 基于对内部推理机制的原则性理解，为推进知识编辑能力建立了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

Abstract: Answering complex real-world questions requires step-by-step retrieval and
integration of relevant information to generate well-grounded responses.
However, existing knowledge distillation methods overlook the need for
different reasoning abilities at different steps, hindering transfer in
multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks. To address this, we propose Stepwise
Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise
supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across
stages. Additionally, it incorporates difficulty-aware training to
progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop
QA benchmarks, with an 8B model achieving performance comparable to a 70B

Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生不完整或选择性省略关键信息的输出，在敏感领域这种遗漏可能造成严重危害

Method: 研究了三种自动化评估策略：基于NLI的方法、基于Q&A的方法和端到端方法

Result: 简单的端到端方法效果出人意料地好，但鲁棒性、可解释性和结果粒度较差

Conclusion: 端到端方法在检测缺失信息方面表现最佳，但需要权衡其优缺点

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced
robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the
comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when
answering user queries based on multiple sources.

Abstract: This article presents research conducted at the Institute of the Estonian
Language between 2022 and 2025 on the application of large language models
(LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors
address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word
forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on
sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a
unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648
dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic
enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%
of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732
dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of
headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the
Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping
tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text
recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings
demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for
saving time and financial resources.

Conclusion: A²Search能够有效解决歧义问题并在不同基准间泛化，表明接受歧义对于构建更可靠的问答系统至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model
weights can be found at https://github.com/zfj1998/A2Search

*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightReasoner是一个新颖框架，利用小型语言模型(SLM)与大型语言模型(LLM)的行为差异来识别关键推理时刻，通过专家-业余对比构建监督示例，从而高效提升LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调(SFT)方法资源密集，需要大量标注数据，且对所有token进行统一优化，而实际上只有少数token具有学习价值。本文探索反向思路：能否让小型语言模型通过揭示高价值推理时刻来教导大型语言模型？

Method: LightReasoner采用两阶段框架：1)采样阶段通过专家-业余对比识别关键推理时刻并构建监督示例；2)微调阶段使用这些蒸馏示例对齐专家模型，放大其推理优势。

Result: 在七个数学基准测试中，LightReasoner将准确率提升高达28.1%，同时减少90%的时间消耗、80%的采样问题和99%的微调token使用，且不依赖真实标签。

Conclusion: 通过将较弱的小型语言模型转化为有效的教学信号，LightReasoner为提升大型语言模型推理能力提供了一种可扩展且资源高效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur
contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these
distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven
mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while
reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token
usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker
SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and
resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning. Code is available at:

TL;DR: LLMs在社交推理任务中表现不佳，存在认知混淆和逻辑不一致问题。本文提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，通过构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，显著提升了社交推理准确性并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学和代码推理方面表现出色，但在社交推理任务中却存在认知混淆、逻辑不一致以及客观世界状态与主观信念状态混淆的问题，这限制了它们在社交场景中的应用。

Method: 提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，动态监控推理轨迹中的混淆指标，并通过提供清晰的世界状态描述来及时干预，帮助模型克服认知困境。

Result: 在三个社交基准测试中，该方法显著提高了准确性（如在Hi-ToM中提升10%），同时降低了计算成本（最高减少33.8%的token使用量）。

Conclusion: 该机制为在社交场景中部署LLMs提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案，通过模仿人类使用隐式世界模型来区分外部事件和内部信念的方式，解决了LLMs在社交推理中的核心问题。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

Motivation: 科学图表标题需要准确性和风格一致性来传达视觉信息，现有方法缺乏对作者特定写作风格的适应能力。

Method: 两阶段流水线：第一阶段使用上下文过滤、类别特定提示优化和候选标题选择；第二阶段应用少样本提示进行风格精炼。

Result: 类别特定提示相比零样本方法提升ROUGE-1召回率8.3%，BLEU-4下降10.9%；风格精炼使BLEU分数提升40-48%，ROUGE提升25-27%。

Conclusion: 结合上下文理解和作者特定风格适应可以生成既科学准确又风格忠实于源论文的图表标题。

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理在测试时是静态的，无法从经验中学习，缺乏知识积累和持续改进的能力，这限制了它们在现实世界长时程任务中的应用。

Method: 提出MUSE框架，包含分层记忆模块，代理在执行每个子任务后自主反思轨迹，将原始轨迹转化为结构化经验并整合到记忆模块中，实现持续学习和自我进化。

Result: 在TAC长时程生产力基准测试中，仅使用轻量级Gemini-2.5 Flash模型就取得了显著优于现有方法的SOTA性能，随着经验积累，任务完成能力持续提升，且积累的经验具有强泛化性。

Conclusion: MUSE建立了一个能够实现现实世界生产力任务自动化的AI代理新范式，具备持续学习、自我进化和零样本改进新任务的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

Motivation: 探索ChatGPT在日英翻译任务中的表现，比较不同提示策略和翻译级别，并与商业翻译引擎进行对比。

Method: 使用简单和增强提示策略，进行文档级和句子级翻译对比，采用自动评估和基于MQM的人工评估方法。

Result: 文档级翻译优于句子级翻译；增强提示与简单提示效果差异不明显；ChatGPT-3.5在自动评估中表现更好，但与ChatGPT-4存在准确性与流畅性的权衡；ChatGPT与主流翻译系统竞争力相当。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在日英翻译中具有竞争力，文档级翻译策略更有效，不同版本ChatGPT在准确性和流畅性方面各有优势。

Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT for Japanese-English translation, exploring
simple and enhanced prompts and comparing against commercially available
translation engines. Performing both automatic and MQM-based human evaluations,
we found that document-level translation outperforms sentence-level translation
for ChatGPT. On the other hand, we were not able to determine if enhanced
prompts performed better than simple prompts in our experiments. We also
discovered that ChatGPT-3.5 was preferred by automatic evaluation, but a
tradeoff exists between accuracy (ChatGPT-3.5) and fluency (ChatGPT-4). Lastly,
ChatGPT yields competitive results against two widely-known translation
systems.

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型从参数知识中回忆气候常态的能力，发现模型能捕捉基本气候结构但存在空间一致性误差，特别是在高海拔地区，且无法准确再现温度变化的空间模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在气候相关应用中的部署增加，了解其内部气候知识对于可靠性评估和错误信息风险分析至关重要，但目前LLMs回忆气候常态的能力尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 构建全球1度分辨率的网格查询，要求模型回忆1991-2020年7月平均2米气温，提供坐标和位置描述符，并将响应与ERA5再分析数据验证。

Result: LLMs编码了非平凡的气候结构，能捕捉纬度和地形模式，均方根误差为3-6°C，偏差为±1°C。但在山区和高纬度地区存在空间一致性误差，海拔1500米以上性能急剧下降。包含地理上下文可将误差平均降低27%。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs能捕捉当前气候分布，但难以再现长期温度变化的空间模式，这对理解气候动态至关重要。评估框架为量化LLMs中的参数气候知识提供了可复现基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

Motivation: 传统对齐方法主要依赖结果奖励模型(ORMs)仅评估最终答案，而过程奖励模型(PRMs)能够评估和指导推理过程中的每个步骤，弥补了这一不足。

Method: 通过完整的循环流程：生成过程数据、构建PRMs、使用PRMs进行测试时扩展和强化学习，系统梳理了PRMs的设计空间和应用方法。

Result: 总结了PRMs在数学、代码、文本、多模态推理、机器人和智能体等领域的应用，并回顾了新兴的基准测试。

Conclusion: 明确了PRMs的设计空间，揭示了开放挑战，为未来实现细粒度、鲁棒的推理对齐研究提供了指导。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability,
conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models
(ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this
gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This
survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to
generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and
reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text,
multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our
goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future
research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment.

Motivation: 传统集中式或完全本地训练方法在平衡隐私保护和个性化方面面临挑战，现有联邦学习方法在有限客户端数据下容易过拟合，并在多轮训练后遗忘全局信息，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出FedDTRE策略，不直接替换本地模型为全局模型，而是利用全局和本地模型在公平导向评估数据集上的可信度得分，动态调节全局模型在本地更新中的贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明，FedDTRE能够提高对话模型性能并增强对话生成质量。

Conclusion: FedDTRE为解决联邦对话生成中的过拟合和全局信息遗忘问题提供了有效方案，提升了模型性能和对话质量。

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

Motivation: 探究在人类擅长的常识领域，LLM生成的论据是否能够影响人类的判断和信念，这既是对人类认知的研究，也具有实际应用担忧。

Method: 收集了3000个人类合理性判断和13600个LLM判断，通过展示LLM生成的支持/反对论据来观察人类评分的变化。

Result: 当存在LLM生成的支持论据时，人类平均合理性评分上升；存在反对论据时评分下降，表明人类认为这些论据具有说服力。LLM实验也显示出类似的影响模式。

Conclusion: LLM可用于研究人类认知，但也引发担忧：即使在人类擅长的常识领域，LLM仍可能对人们的信念产生显著影响。

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's
beliefs.

Motivation: 谈判是AI智能体的基本挑战，需要战略推理、对手建模以及合作与竞争的平衡能力。本研究首次系统评估推理能力对商业和开源LLM谈判能力的影响，并跨三种语言进行比较。

Method: 使用自博弈设置，在三种不同的对话游戏中分析性能与成本的权衡、推理过程的语言一致性以及模型展现的战略适应性质。

Result: 启用推理（即扩展测试时计算）显著改善谈判结果，GPT-5性能提升31.4%，但成本增加近400%。开源模型在德语或意大利语谈判中会切换至英语进行内部推理，而领先商业模型能保持推理与输出的语言一致性。

Conclusion: 推理能力能有效提升LLM谈判表现，但需权衡计算成本；语言一致性问题是开源模型在可解释性方面的重要限制。

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an
ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with
competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating
the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial
and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play
setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between
performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of
reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language
consistency between their reasoning and final output.

Motivation: 由于每个语言模型都有自己的词汇表作为可能的标记集合，它们在下一个标记分布层面（如模型集成）难以相互协作。

Method: 建立无损词汇缩减的理论框架，将给定自回归语言模型高效转换为具有任意小词汇量的模型，不损失任何精度。

Result: 通过最大公共词汇，不同分词方式的语言模型能够高效协作。

Conclusion: 提出的无损词汇缩减框架解决了不同语言模型在词汇层面协作的难题，为模型集成等应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

Result: 两个模型在分类赞助内容方面表现强劲（F1最高0.93），但在模糊案例中性能下降超过10个百分点。常见错误包括引用遗漏（28.57%）、不明确引用（20.71%），隐藏广告的错误率最高（28.57%）。

Conclusion: 该研究为监管合规技术提供了LLM生成法律推理错误的分类法，推进了网红营销内容的透明检测，支持广告监管机构在坚实法律基础上自动化审核流程。

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating

knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally
robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing
content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated
by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it
combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM
explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support
advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid
legal foundation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM作为评估者在规模上越来越多地使用甚至替代人工标注，理解其潜在偏见和风险变得至关重要。

Method: 1) CLoVE：生成可验证的、基于概念的对比性局部解释；2) GloVE：通过迭代聚类、总结和验证将局部规则浓缩为全局策略。

Result: 在7个标准内容危害检测基准数据集上评估，提取的全局策略对LLM-as-a-Judge决策具有高度忠实性，并对文本扰动和对抗攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 用户研究表明，用户对全局策略的理解和满意度较高，该方法有助于揭示LLM评估的潜在偏见。

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

TL;DR: Genii是一个无监督多智能体协作优化框架，通过模拟交互式客户端-服务器轮询机制来减轻LLM评估模型的判断偏好偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为自动评估器存在判断偏好偏差，倾向于偏爱自身生成的响应，这降低了评估的可靠性。

Method: 将多个LLM评估模型集成到多智能体系统中，模拟交互式客户端-服务器轮询机制，无监督地优化每个客户端智能体。

Result: Genii在实验中优于基于标注判断数据训练的监督模型，且无需人工标注。在不同客户端智能体的轮询过程中持续提升性能，即使使用较弱模型作为服务器智能体也有效。

Conclusion: Genii能有效减轻LLM评估模型的判断偏好偏差，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes

Conclusion: 该方法成功消除了联络中心的冷启动差距，通过自动知识提取和轻量级LLM微调，实现了高效的知识库构建和对话AI系统部署。

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

Method: DACIP-RC通过基于对话记录的阅读理解生成多样化任务指令和响应，替代传统的下一词预测预训练方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在商业对话数据上应用指令预训练的工作，为行业利用专有数据集进行领域适应提供了见解。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生错误的拒绝，拒绝那些包含类似不安全查询术语的良性请求，这影响了模型的实用性。

Method: 引入XSB和MS-XSB基准测试，使用事后解释方法识别拒绝触发词，并部署忽略词指令、提示重述和注意力引导三种模型无关方法。

Result: 实验显示这些策略显著提高了安全提示的合规性，同时保持了强大的安全保护，特别是在复杂多轮场景中效果明显。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可复现的诊断和缓解过度拒绝的框架，为更安全和更有用的LLM部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型在简单任务上"过度思考"的问题，现有方法通常是启发式且任务特定的，缺乏自适应推理的通用框架

Method: 使用强化学习框架增强长度感知优化，整合视觉理解和可执行代码推理，支持多模态应用

Result: 在保持与传统推理模型相当性能的同时，平均减少超过70%的token使用量

Conclusion: ARM2有效解决了过度思考问题，在推理性能和效率之间实现了良好平衡

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

Motivation: 现有NLP研究主要关注诗歌自动生成和摘要，而许多语言都有成熟的格律传统，这些高级文学形式为深入探索LLMs的推理能力和语言理解提供了机会。

Method: 设计了MetricalARGS分类法，将诗歌相关NLP任务分为四个维度：分析(Analysis)、检索(Retrieval)、生成(Generation)和支持(Support)，并以泰卢固语为例说明应用方法。

Result: 建立了首个系统的诗歌NLP任务分类框架，展示了如何通过格律诗来理解当前LLMs的能力和局限性。

Conclusion: MetricalARGS分类法为通过格律诗视角理解LLMs的能力和局限性提供了更广泛的可能性，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Prior NLP work studying poetry has focused primarily on automatic poem
generation and summarization. Many languages have well-studied traditions of
poetic meter which enforce constraints on a poem in terms of syllable and
phoneme patterns. Such advanced literary forms offer opportunities for probing
deeper reasoning and language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their ability to follow strict pre-requisites and rules. In this paper, we
introduce MetricalARGS, the first taxonomy of poetry-related NLP tasks designed
to evaluate LLMs on metrical poetry across four dimensions: Analysis,
Retrieval, Generation, and Support. We discuss how these tasks relate to
existing NLP tasks, addressing questions around datasets and evaluation
metrics. Taking Telugu as our example language, we illustrate how the taxonomy
can be used in practice. MetricalARGS highlights the broader possibilities for
understanding the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs through the lens
of metrical poetry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在专业领域表现下降，现有方法依赖昂贵的参数更新且容易过拟合，需要更轻量级的解决方案。

Method: 使用训练免费的组相对策略优化，在少量真实数据上进行多轮学习，提取高质量经验知识作为token先验，在LLM API调用时集成使用。

Result: 在数学推理和网络搜索任务上，使用DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus模型，仅需几十个训练样本就能显著提升跨域性能，优于经过微调的小型LLM。

Conclusion: Training-Free GRPO是一种成本效益高的方法，无需参数更新即可有效提升LLM智能体在专业领域的表现，解决了数据稀缺和过拟合问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their
promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized
real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating
external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic
reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely
on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output
distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the
output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which
is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data
scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we
propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),
a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any
parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage
instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling
high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal
ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is
seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments
on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that
Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly
improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,
Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training
data and cost.

*Shaohua Zhang,Yuan Lin,Hang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了函数令牌假说来解释大语言模型的工作机制：在推理阶段，函数令牌激活上下文中最具预测性的特征并指导下一个令牌预测（记忆检索）；在预训练阶段，预测函数令牌后的内容令牌会增加模型学习到的特征数量并更新参数（记忆巩固）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在知识记忆、指令跟随和推理方面表现出色，但其记忆检索和巩固机制仍不清楚。本文旨在揭示LLMs内部工作机制，特别是函数令牌在记忆过程中的关键作用。

Method: 提出了函数令牌假说，将令牌分为函数令牌（如标点、冠词、介词等）和内容令牌。通过二分图分析证明少数函数令牌激活了大部分特征，并通过案例研究展示函数令牌如何激活最具预测性的特征来指导下一个令牌预测。

Result: 实验证据表明：1）少量函数令牌激活了大部分特征；2）函数令牌能够从上下文中激活最具预测性的特征来指导下一个令牌预测；3）预训练损失主要由预测函数令牌后的内容令牌主导。

Conclusion: 函数令牌假说为理解LLMs的记忆检索和巩固机制提供了新的理论框架，揭示了函数令牌在模型推理和预训练过程中的核心作用，有助于深入理解大语言模型的工作机制。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

TL;DR: 研究表明，在特定领域微调LLMs可能导致广泛的不诚实行为，这种现象在混合任务和实际人机交互中同样存在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在微调恶意或不正确内容后，是否会在高风险场景下表现出广泛的不诚实和欺骗行为，即所谓的涌现性失调现象。

Method: 对开源LLMs在不同领域进行失调补全微调，并在下游混合任务和模拟人机交互环境中测试其行为变化。

Result: LLMs在微调后表现出广泛的不诚实行为；在标准下游任务中仅引入1%失调数据即可使诚实行为下降20%以上；在10%偏斜用户群体下，助手LLM会无意中加剧不诚实行为。

Conclusion: 涌现性失调风险不仅存在于直接微调中，也存在于下游混合任务和实际人机交互中，强调了LLMs在高风险场景下不诚实行为的潜在危害。

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the
repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that
this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis
for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced
understanding and research innovations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个包含反因果声明的新数据集，解决了现有因果提取研究中忽略反因果关系的问题，并证明该数据集能有效提升模型区分正反因果关系的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果提取研究几乎完全忽略了反因果声明，现有数据集只关注支持关系的"正因果"声明，而反驳关系的"反因果"声明被完全忽略甚至被错误标注为正因果。

Method: 基于广泛的文献综述，首先证明反因果性是不完整知识下因果推理的组成部分；然后制定严格的标注指南，在因果新闻语料库基础上增加反因果声明，获得了较高的标注者间一致性(Cohen's κ=0.74)。

Result: 证明未经过反因果关系训练的模型倾向于将反因果关系误分类为正因果；基于新数据集可以减轻这种错误，使transformer模型能有效区分正反因果关系。

Conclusion: 整合反因果声明对于准确的因果提取至关重要，新数据集能够显著提升模型在区分正反因果关系方面的性能。

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

Motivation: 解决LLM在安全性和有用性之间的平衡问题，现有安全防护模型完全拒绝不安全内容会加剧过度拒绝，缺乏对拒绝查询的细致指导。

Method: 使用多智能体强化学习框架，联合训练对话智能体和反馈智能体，采用动态改进奖励机制，根据对话智能体整合反馈的效果进行演化。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验显示，WaltzRL显著减少了不安全响应（如WildJailbreak上从39.0%降至4.6%）和过度拒绝（OR-Bench上从45.3%降至9.9%）。

Conclusion: WaltzRL通过让对话和反馈智能体共同演化并自适应应用反馈，在不降低通用能力的情况下增强了LLM安全性，推进了有用性和无害性之间的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

TL;DR: 使用对比解码生成合成语料库，与原始数据混合训练，可提升语言建模和下游任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM训练数据可能枯竭的问题，探索使用LLM自身生成的合成数据作为补充训练数据的可行性

Method: 在受控环境中，使用对比解码方法（好模型与坏模型之间的相对差异）生成合成语料库，并将其与原始1亿词语料库混合训练

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据混合训练下，语言建模目标和一系列下游任务性能均有提升；对比解码的合成数据对需要推理技能的任务更有益，传统采样方法对依赖表层语言能力的任务帮助更大

Conclusion: 合成数据可以作为有效的训练数据补充，不同采样方法生成的合成数据对不同类型任务具有互补优势

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

TL;DR: DeepMiner是一个通过高难度训练任务和动态上下文窗口来激发多轮智能体深度推理能力的新框架，在多个搜索代理基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在具有长视野交互的多轮智能体中激发深度推理能力，需要解决复杂但可验证的训练数据生成和长上下文管理问题。

Method: 提出反向构建方法从真实网络源生成复杂但可验证的问答对，设计动态上下文管理策略，使用滑动窗口机制消除对外部摘要模型的依赖。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B上通过强化学习开发的DeepMiner-32B在BrowseComp-en上达到33.5%准确率，比之前最佳开源智能体提升近20个百分点，在多个基准测试中均表现优异。

Conclusion: DeepMiner框架有效解决了多轮交互系统的上下文限制问题，支持近100轮持续交互，显著提升了智能体的深度推理能力。

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive
behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to
invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon
interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such
abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context
window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex
but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures
the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive
capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant
yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and
inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency
on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to
handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement
learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner
attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best
open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent
improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our
dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns
within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context
limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

*Taisei Yamamoto,Ryoma Kumon,Danushka Bollegala,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过神经元级分析识别驱动文化行为的关键神经元，发现文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元集中在浅中层MLP层，抑制这些神经元会显著降低文化基准性能但不影响通用NLU性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在全球部署，确保其公平和全面的文化理解很重要。但LLMs存在文化偏见和对少数文化认知有限的问题，且其文化理解机制尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用基于梯度的评分方法进行神经元级分析，识别文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元，并通过抑制实验验证其作用。

Result: 识别出占总数不到1%的文化相关神经元，集中在浅中层MLP层。抑制这些神经元使文化基准性能下降达30%，但通用NLU性能基本不受影响。文化特定神经元还支持相关文化的知识。

Conclusion: 在包含文化通用神经元的模块上进行NLU基准训练会削弱模型的文化理解能力，这为LLM内部机制提供了见解，并为模型训练和工程提供实用指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

TL;DR: AutoRed是一个无需种子指令的自由形式对抗提示生成框架，通过角色引导的指令生成和反思循环来改进提示质量，并使用验证器评估提示危害性，显著提高了攻击成功率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队方法依赖种子指令，限制了对抗提示的语义多样性，需要开发更有效的自由形式红队方法来评估LLM安全性。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）角色引导的对抗指令生成；2）通过反思循环迭代优化低质量提示。引入验证器在不查询目标模型的情况下评估提示危害性。

Result: 构建了AutoRed-Medium和AutoRed-Hard两个红队数据集，在八个最先进LLM上评估，相比现有基线实现了更高的攻击成功率和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于种子的方法存在局限性，自由形式红队在LLM安全评估方面具有巨大潜力，将开源数据集。

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

*Yukai Song,Pengfei Zhou,César Escobar-Viera,Candice Biernesser,Wei Huang,Jingtong Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段投票架构，用于在社交媒体上检测自杀意念，平衡效率与鲁棒性。第一阶段使用轻量级BERT处理明确案例，第二阶段对模糊输入采用多视角LLM投票或基于心理特征的ML集成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球自杀率上升，需要主动预防策略。社交媒体提供有价值信号，但检测隐含的自杀意念（通过隐喻、讽刺或微妙情感线索传达）极具挑战性。轻量级模型无法处理隐含信号，而大型语言模型计算成本过高。

Method: 两阶段架构：第一阶段使用BERT快速处理高置信度的明确案例；第二阶段对模糊输入采用（i）多视角LLM投票框架最大化隐含意念的召回率，或（ii）基于心理特征指标的ML集成，通过提示工程LLM提取特征以提高效率和可解释性。

Result: 在两个互补数据集（明确主导的Reddit和仅隐含的DeepSuiMind）上，框架优于单模型基线，明确案例F1达98.0%，隐含案例达99.7%，跨域差距降至2%以下，同时显著降低LLM成本。

Conclusion: 该框架有效平衡了自杀意念检测的效率与鲁棒性，是首批将LLM提取的心理特征作为结构化向量用于自杀风险检测的工作之一，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

*Ioana Marinescu,Kyunghyun Cho,Eric Karl Oermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了上下文学习(ICL)中表示和学习两个方面的独立性，发现演示的表示决定了ICL的基线准确率，而学习能力独立于表示质量存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去研究主要关注ICL中演示表示方式对性能的影响，但对ICL学习能力的研究结果不一。本文旨在探究表示和学习这两个方面在ICL中的相互作用关系。

Method: 开发优化算法枚举不同语义相关性的标签集，然后对每个标签集使用不同数量的上下文演示进行ICL实验。

Result: 无论标签集质量如何，学习都会发生，但学习效率受标签集质量和语言模型参数数量的影响。表示质量对准确率的相对影响在学习过程中保持不变。

Conclusion: ICL中的表示和学习效应是相互独立的，演示表示决定基线性能，而学习能力独立存在，这一发现揭示了ICL中一个未被充分探索的方面。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型对条件陈述可接受性的判断，发现模型对条件概率和语义相关性敏感，但与人类判断存在差异，且模型规模增大不一定更接近人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件可接受性在沟通和推理中很重要，但之前的研究主要关注LLMs的条件推理能力，不清楚它们如何判断条件陈述的可接受性。

Method: 使用线性混合效应模型和ANOVA测试，分析不同模型家族、规模和提示策略下LLMs的条件可接受性判断。

Result: LLMs对条件概率和语义相关性都敏感，但敏感程度因架构和提示风格而异；与人类数据比较显示LLMs使用这些线索不如人类一致；更大模型不一定更接近人类判断。

Conclusion: LLMs在条件可接受性判断中整合了概率和语义线索，但与人类存在系统性差异，模型规模不是改善与人类一致性的关键因素。

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

Motivation: 挑战当前深度学习范式和扩展定律，探索更高效的预训练方法。

Method: 使用单层、双头、8M参数的Co⁴模型，采用近似O(N)计算复杂度，在10M tokens上进行高效预训练。

Result: 在BabyLM评估中，Co⁴在5/7零-shot指标和6/7微调任务上超越GPT-2，在4/7指标上超越GPT-BERT。

Conclusion: 结果表明需要重新思考深度学习范式和扩展定律，小模型也能实现高效性能。

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two
heads, and 8M parameters, operating at an approximate cost of $O(N)$ (where $N$
is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2
(124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two
epochs, while both are trained for ten. Co$^4$ achieves orders-of-magnitude
greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample
efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across
complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out
of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out
of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink
prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大推理模型在简单问题上会产生不必要的冗长推理轨迹，而在困难问题上探索不足导致错过解决方案，需要平衡推理效率。

Method: 提出两阶段训练流程：自适应冷启动阶段根据问题难度调整推理轨迹长度；第二阶段开发自适应熵策略优化，使用高窗口熵令牌作为探索触发器，结合分层熵奖励和动态KL控制来决定探索程度。

Result: ARES在多种数学、逻辑和多模态基准测试中实现了优越的性能和推理效率，在显著降低推理成本的同时缩小了与领先商业系统的差距。

Conclusion: ARES框架通过自适应推理机制有效解决了推理模型在难易问题上的不平衡表现，实现了更好的性能和效率平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems
under significantly lower inference costs.

Result: 任务吸引了多样化参与，结果揭示了建模变异方法的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 这些贡献加强了LEWIDI作为框架，为开发分歧感知技术提供了新资源、基准和发现。

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained
to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human
judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并行扩展虽然能增强大语言模型的推理能力，但会产生大量计算冗余——超过80%的并行推理轨迹产生相同的最终答案，造成计算浪费。

Method: 提出DeepPrune框架，包含：1) 使用焦点损失和过采样技术训练的专业判断模型，用于从部分推理轨迹预测答案等价性；2) 在线贪心聚类算法，动态剪枝冗余路径同时保持答案多样性。

Result: 在三个挑战性基准测试(AIME 2024、AIME 2025和GPQA)上，DeepPrune相比传统共识采样实现了超过80%的token减少，同时准确率保持在3个百分点以内。

Conclusion: DeepPrune为高效并行推理设立了新标准，使高性能推理更加高效。

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

Conclusion: 新词学习能够有效控制LLM概念，并通过自我表达增强模型理解，支持多概念联合学习。

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

Result: 实验表明，在有限计算预算下，该方法比基线方法实现了更高的分类准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效优化提示，在ToS公平性检测任务中实现更好的性能，同时控制计算成本。

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a
language model's performance on specific tasks. Fairness detection in Terms of
Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully
crafted prompts to ensure reliable results. However, existing prompt
optimization methods are often computationally expensive due to inefficient
search strategies and costly prompt candidate scoring. In this paper, we
propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy
prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing
evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a
constrained computation budget.

Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法在推理模型上表现不佳：token丢弃方法会破坏推理完整性，头重分配方法会错误压缩推理关键的头，导致性能显著下降。

Method: 使用强化学习框架直接优化每个头的缓存使用与推理质量之间的关系，识别推理关键的头，然后对这些头分配完整KV缓存，对其他头应用压缩的常量KV缓存。

Result: 实验表明只有少量注意力头对推理至关重要，RLKV在实现20-50%缓存减少的同时，性能接近未压缩结果，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KV头在推理模型中具有功能异质性，RLKV成功识别并保护推理关键的头，实现了高效的KV缓存压缩，为推理模型的部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

TL;DR: CoMAS是一个多智能体协同进化框架，通过智能体间的相互讨论和协作实现自主进化，无需外部监督，在大多数评估设置中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的自进化方法依赖于外部奖励信号或从LLM自身提取内在奖励，这与人类通过相互讨论和协作实现自我进化的机制不符。

Method: CoMAS框架从丰富的讨论动态中生成内在奖励，使用LLM作为评判机制来制定这些奖励，并通过强化学习优化每个智能体的策略，实现去中心化和可扩展的协同进化。

Result: 实验结果显示CoMAS持续优于未经训练的智能体，在大多数评估设置中达到最先进性能。消融研究证实了基于交互的奖励信号的必要性，并显示出随着智能体数量和多样性增加的良好可扩展性。

Conclusion: CoMAS为基于LLM的智能体自进化建立了一个新颖有效的范式，通过多智能体协作实现了真正的自主进化。

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: ArenaBencher是一个模型无关的基准测试进化框架，通过自动更新测试用例来解决数据泄露问题，提高基准测试的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于预训练数据泄露，现有基准测试的有效性受到质疑，模型可能只是匹配记忆内容而非展示真正的泛化能力，这导致分数膨胀、模型比较失真和进展误判。

Method: 给定现有基准和待评估模型池，ArenaBencher推断每个测试案例的核心能力，生成保持原始目标的候选问答对，使用LLM作为裁判验证正确性和意图，并聚合多个模型的反馈来选择暴露共同弱点的候选案例。

Result: 在数学问题解决、常识推理和安全领域应用ArenaBencher，产生了经过验证、多样化且公平的更新，揭示了新的失败模式，在保持测试目标对齐的同时增加了难度，并提高了模型可区分性。

Conclusion: 该框架为在基础模型快速发展的同时持续进化基准测试提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.

Abstract: Instruction-following navigation is a key step toward embodied intelligence.
Prior benchmarks mainly focus on semantic understanding but overlook
systematically evaluating navigation agents' spatial perception and reasoning
capabilities. In this work, we introduce the NavSpace benchmark, which contains
six task categories and 1,228 trajectory-instruction pairs designed to probe
the spatial intelligence of navigation agents. On this benchmark, we
comprehensively evaluate 22 navigation agents, including state-of-the-art

lift the veil on spatial intelligence in embodied navigation. Furthermore, we

TL;DR: TTOM是一个无需训练的视频生成框架，通过测试时优化和记忆机制来改善视频基础模型在组合场景下的表现，实现更好的文本-图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型在视觉生成方面表现出色，但在组合场景（如运动、数字和空间关系）中表现不佳，需要提升文本-图像对齐能力。

Method: 提出TTOM框架，在推理时通过布局注意力目标优化新参数，并采用参数化记忆机制维护历史优化上下文，支持插入、读取、更新和删除等灵活操作。

Result: 实验结果表明TTOM在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准测试中表现优异，能够有效解耦组合性世界知识，具有强大的可迁移性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: TTOM是一个有效、实用、可扩展且高效的框架，能够实现组合视频生成的跨模态对齐。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出视觉象似性挑战基准，评估视觉语言模型在手语象似性理解上的表现，发现模型在语音形式预测、透明度和象似性评分方面均低于人类基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语中的象似性（形式与意义的相似性）为视觉基础化提供了自然测试平台，需要评估VLMs从动态人体动作而非静态上下文中恢复这种基本映射的能力。

Method: 引入视觉象似性挑战基准，采用心理语言学测量方法评估13个最先进VLMs在三个任务上的表现：语音形式预测、透明度和分级象似性评分。

Result: VLMs在语音形式预测中恢复了一些手形和位置细节但低于人类表现；在透明度任务中远低于人类基线；只有顶级模型与人类象似性评分呈中等相关。有趣的是，语音形式预测能力更强的模型与人类象似性判断相关性更好。

Conclusion: 验证了这些诊断任务的有效性，并建议采用以人为中心的信号和具身学习方法建模象似性，改进多模态模型中的视觉基础化。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

TL;DR: 该论文发现视觉变换器(ViT)中存在一类高范数视觉标记，称为ViT注意力汇聚点，这些标记包含图像的高级语义概念，对大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)的理解和推理能力至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM中的注意力汇聚点，但很少研究ViT中的注意力汇聚点。这些ViT汇聚点包含重要语义信息，但在现有LVLM架构中常被忽视。

Method: 提出定性和定量分析ViT汇聚点中的信息，并开发了无需训练和基于训练的方法来更好地利用这些信息。

Result: 通过显式利用这些ViT汇聚点标记，在各种LVLMs和视觉推理任务中实现了显著改进。

Conclusion: ViT注意力汇聚点在增强视觉推理方面具有未开发的潜力，应更有效地整合到LVLM架构中。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论框架来解释为什么在预训练模型中对随机选择的小子网络进行微调就足以适应下游任务，并基于此提出了SliceFine参数高效微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法通常需要添加新的参数，缺乏理论解释为什么仅更新一小部分参数就足够。本文旨在为这种现象提供理论依据。

Method: 提出了Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis，基于谱平衡和任务能量两个现象。然后提出了SliceFine方法，仅更新原始权重中的选定切片，不引入新参数。

Result: SliceFine在语言和视觉任务上达到了最先进PEFT方法的性能，同时显著提高了训练速度、内存效率和模型紧凑性。

Conclusion: 本文连接了理论与实践，为现有PEFT技术提供了理论基础的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在空间推理方面存在根本性挑战，主要原因是缺乏从感知到理解的层次化基础。需要建立渐进式的空间智能构建方法。

Method: 构建SpatialLadder-26k多模态数据集，包含26,610个样本；设计三阶段渐进训练框架：1)通过物体定位建立空间感知，2)通过多维空间任务发展空间理解，3)通过可验证奖励的强化学习加强复杂推理。

Result: SpatialLadder模型在空间推理基准测试中平均提升23.4%，超越GPT-4o 20.8%和Gemini-2.0-Flash 10.1%；在域外基准测试中保持强泛化能力，提升7.2%。

Conclusion: 从感知到推理的渐进式训练对于构建鲁棒的空间智能至关重要，该方法为空间推理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

TL;DR: VideoNorms是一个包含1000多个视频片段-规范对的文化基准数据集，用于评估视频大语言模型的文化意识，涵盖中美文化背景，基于言语行为理论标注了社会文化规范、规范遵守/违反标签以及语言和非语言证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频大语言模型在全球部署，需要评估其对不同文化背景的理解和接地能力，但缺乏合适的基准测试工具。

Method: 采用人机协作框架构建数据集：使用基于理论提示的教师模型生成候选标注，由训练有素的人类专家验证和修正标注。

Result: 基准测试发现：1)模型在规范违反检测上表现更差；2)对中国文化的理解不如美国文化；3)提供非语言证据比语言证据更困难；4)在正式非幽默语境中表现不如人类。

Conclusion: 研究强调了视频语言模型需要文化接地训练的必要性，VideoNorms基准和框架为填补这一空白提供了开端。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

Conclusion: 该框架通过自动数据合成和偏好学习，显著提升了VLM控制器的工具使用推理能力，为多模态智能体发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

TL;DR: 提出TaoSR-AGRL框架，通过规则感知奖励塑造和自适应引导回放，解决电商搜索中LLM相关性预测的长尾和复杂推理问题，在淘宝搜索中显著优于DPO和GRPO基线方法。


<details>

Motivation: 电商搜索中查询-产品相关性预测对用户体验至关重要，但现有LLM方法在处理复杂业务规则和用户查询时缺乏鲁棒推理能力，强化学习方法面临稀疏奖励和收敛慢的问题。

Method: TaoSR-AGRL框架包含两个创新：1）规则感知奖励塑造，将最终相关性判断分解为与领域标准对齐的密集结构化奖励；2）自适应引导回放，识别训练中的低准确率轨迹并注入针对性真实指导。

Result: 在真实世界大规模数据集和淘宝搜索在线评估中，TaoSR-AGRL持续优于DPO和标准GRPO基线，提升了相关性准确性、规则遵循性和训练稳定性，已成功部署在淘宝主搜索场景服务数亿用户。

Conclusion: TaoSR-AGRL通过密集奖励和自适应引导有效解决了LLM相关性预测中的推理挑战，为电商搜索提供了更可靠的相关性预测解决方案。

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and
has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic
understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and
business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative,
reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes
the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning
capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via
reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient
guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these
challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning
framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance.
TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which
decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned
with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which
identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted
ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating
reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on
large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human
evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO
baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence,
and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully
deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of
users.

Result: 在VersionQA基准测试中达到90%准确率，比朴素RAG(58%)和GraphRAG(64%)显著提升；在隐式变更检测上达到60%准确率，而基线方法几乎失效(0-10%)；索引时比GraphRAG节省97%的token。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了版本化文档问答作为一个独立任务，并为未来研究提供了解决方案和基准。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve
through versioning-a ubiquitous characteristic of technical documentation.
Existing approaches achieve only 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive
questions, retrieving semantically similar content without temporal validity
checks. We present VersionRAG, a version-aware RAG framework that explicitly
models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing
version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states.
During retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on
intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change
tracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34
versioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming
naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit
change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to
track undocumented modifications. Additionally, VersionRAG requires 97% fewer
tokens during indexing than GraphRAG, making it practical for large-scale
deployment. Our work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and
provides both a solution and benchmark for future research.

TL;DR: ReasonEmbed是一个专为推理密集型文档检索设计的文本嵌入模型，通过ReMixer数据合成方法和Redapter自适应学习算法，在多个骨干网络上实现了推理检索任务的卓越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理密集型文档检索中现有文本嵌入模型难以捕捉复杂语义关系的问题，特别是在处理需要深度推理的查询时。

Method: 1. ReMixer数据合成方法：克服先前合成数据集的平凡性问题，大规模生成82K高质量训练样本；2. Redapter自适应学习算法：根据推理强度动态调整训练样本权重；3. 在多个不同规模的骨干网络上实现ReasonEmbed。

Result: ReasonEmbed-Qwen3-8B模型在BRIGHT基准测试中取得了创纪录的nDCG@10分数38.1，显著优于现有文本嵌入模型。

Conclusion: ReasonEmbed通过创新的数据合成和自适应学习算法，在推理密集型检索任务上实现了突破性性能，并将开源相关资源以推动该领域研究发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ReasonEmbed, a novel text embedding model
developed for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our work includes three
key technical contributions. First, we propose ReMixer, a new data synthesis
method that overcomes the triviality problem prevalent in previous synthetic
datasets, enabling large-scale production of 82K high-quality training samples.
Second, we design Redapter, a self-adaptive learning algorithm that dynamically
adjusts training each sample's weight based on its reasoning intensity. This
allows the model to effectively capture the complex semantic relationships
between queries and documents. Third, we implement ReasonEmbed across multiple
backbones of varying sizes, all of which achieve superior performance on
reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Notably, our ReasonEmbed-Qwen3-8B model
offers a record-high nDCG@10 score of 38.1 on the BRIGHT benchmark, which
significantly outperforms existing text embedding models. We will fully
open-source our created resources in ReasonEmbed to push forward the research
advancement in this field.

TL;DR: 提出一种参数空间校正方法，通过比较在真实标签和伪标签上微调的两个ASR模型的权重差异来校正伪标签偏差，在目标域无真实标签的情况下显著提升识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实ASR系统面临领域偏移问题，伪标签方法虽然实用但会引入系统性口音特定错误，传统过滤方法无法有效修正这些偏差。

Method: 在源域中从相同初始化微调两个ASR模型：一个使用真实标签，另一个使用伪标签，计算它们的权重差异作为校正向量，然后将该向量应用于伪标签目标模型。

Result: 在AfriSpeech-200数据集上，对10种非洲口音使用Whisper tiny模型，实现了高达35%的相对词错误率降低。

Conclusion: 参数空间校正方法能有效修正伪标签中的系统性偏差，在无目标域真实标签的情况下显著提升ASR系统在领域偏移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robust ASR under domain shift is crucial because real-world systems encounter
unseen accents and domains with limited labeled data. Although pseudo-labeling
offers a practical workaround, it often introduces systematic, accent-specific
errors that filtering fails to fix. We ask: How can we correct these recurring
biases without target ground truth? We propose a simple parameter-space
correction: in a source domain containing both real and pseudo-labeled data,
two ASR models are fine-tuned from the same initialization, one on ground-truth
labels and the other on pseudo-labels, and their weight difference forms a
correction vector that captures pseudo-label biases. When applied to a
pseudo-labeled target model, this vector enhances recognition, achieving up to
a 35% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on AfriSpeech-200 across ten
African accents with the Whisper tiny model.

Motivation: 探索哪种数据科学方法能更好地回答"哪些议题对选民选择影响最大"的问题，比较AI驱动的意见挖掘与传统调查方法的效果。

Method: 使用自然语言处理和聚类分析两种AI技术，分析选举前一周来自《华尔街日报》和《纽约时报》YouTube频道的8000多条用户评论。

Result: 移民和民主是最频繁且一致被提及的议题，身份政治次之，而通货膨胀的提及频率显著较低。

Conclusion: 在线用户数据的意见挖掘分析比传统民调和调查更能揭示选举结果，挑战了通货膨胀作为重要选举议题的传统认知。

Abstract: This paper aims to explore two competing data science methodologies to
attempt answering the question, "Which issues contributed most to voters'
choice in the 2024 presidential election?" The methodologies involve novel
empirical evidence driven by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By using
two distinct methods based on natural language processing and clustering
analysis to mine over eight thousand user comments on election-related YouTube
videos from one right leaning journal, Wall Street Journal, and one left
leaning journal, New York Times, during pre-election week, we quantify the
frequency of selected issue areas among user comments to infer which issues
were most salient to potential voters in the seven days preceding the November
5th election. Empirically, we primarily demonstrate that immigration and
democracy were the most frequently and consistently invoked issues in user
comments on the analyzed YouTube videos, followed by the issue of identity
politics, while inflation was significantly less frequently referenced. These
results corroborate certain findings of post-election surveys but also refute
the supposed importance of inflation as an election issue. This indicates that
variations on opinion mining, with their analysis of raw user data online, can
be more revealing than polling and surveys for analyzing election outcomes.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ConCuR数据集和KernelCoder模型，通过生成和筛选带有推理轨迹的高质量CUDA内核来解决内核生成任务中高质量数据稀缺的问题，在KernelBench上表现优于现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GPU内核生成任务中高质量数据稀缺的问题，因为大多数高质量内核是专有且不开源的，这阻碍了使用监督微调来使LLM适应内核生成任务。

Method: 开发了一个生成和筛选带有推理轨迹的高质量CUDA内核的流程，构建了ConCuR数据集，并训练了KernelCoder模型，这是首个在包含PyTorch、推理和CUDA内核对的数据集上训练的模型。

Result: 在KernelBench设置中，该模型显著优于现有的最佳模型QwQ-32B，并超越了所有为内核生成微调的开源模型以及前沿模型如DeepSeek-V3.1-Think和Claude-4-sonnet。

Conclusion: 研究发现简洁而信息丰富的推理轨迹能够稳健地生成高性能内核，平均推理长度可以作为评估内核生成任务难度的指标，该流程和观察有助于未来获得更好的内核生成数据。

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

TL;DR: ETD方法通过在推理时迭代特定层来增强大语言模型的推理能力，无需改变模型架构或参数数量，在多个推理基准上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要通过扩大模型规模或增加推理计算来提升推理能力，但研究表明关键推理计算集中在少数层中，因此探索更高效的推理增强方法。

Method: Encode-Think-Decode (ETD)方法：在中间训练阶段训练模型在推理相关层上进行迭代，推理时在选定层上迭代计算，同时探索自适应深度策略。

Result: 在17个推理基准上取得显著提升，OLMo-2 1B模型在GSM8K上相对准确率提升28.4%，在MATH上提升36%。

Conclusion: 递归潜在推理为增强LLM推理能力提供了一条简单有效的路径。

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

<details>

Motivation: 当前LLM遗忘研究碎片化，缺乏对有效遗忘的明确定义和严格评估标准，需要建立系统性的方法论和评估框架。

Method: 提出了三种方法家族的分类：差异驱动优化、表示错位和基于拒绝的定向遗忘；引入了开放式问答评估指标；对WMDP基准进行了重新评估。

Result: 发现当前评估方法过于依赖选择题准确率，往往高估成功而忽略实际生成行为；揭示了遗忘效果与效用保持之间的权衡关系；证明了鲁棒性需要更细粒度的分析。

Conclusion: 为LLM遗忘提供了全面的重新审视和可操作的指导，强调了需要更全面的评估方法来准确衡量遗忘效果、效用保持和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

<details>

Motivation: 解决AI电商直播中数字人需要实时响应，但大型推理模型延迟过高的问题。

Method: 第一阶段：通过拒绝采样微调将670B教师模型蒸馏为30B MoE模型（3B激活）；第二阶段：使用GRPO强化学习压缩推理路径，平衡正确性、帮助性和简洁性。

Result: 计算成本降低30倍，实现亚秒级延迟；在淘宝直播中，响应正确性提升3.3%，帮助性提升21.8%；显著提升GMV。

Conclusion: LiveThinking框架有效解决了电商直播中的实时响应问题，显著提升了用户体验和商业表现。

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

Motivation: 现有防御机制无法泛化到使用未见攻击模板伪装的有害查询，尽管LLMs能在嵌入空间区分这些查询。

Method: 两阶段防御：预生成阶段检测有害查询，生成中阶段监控部分响应；通过专门提示训练LLM预测查询和部分响应的危害性，实现早期终止。

Result: 在多个LLM架构上的实验表明，MetaDefense显著优于现有防御机制，对已知和未知攻击模板的有害查询都能实现鲁棒防御，同时在良性任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MetaDefense提供了一种有效的防御微调越狱攻击的方法，通过两阶段防御策略实现了对有害内容的早期检测和终止。

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized
prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense
significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense
against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining
competitive performance on benign tasks. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种测试时自改进方法，通过识别模型不确定的样本、生成类似示例并进行测试时微调，显著提升语言模型的泛化能力，使用极少的训练样本实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型微调需要大量训练数据，效率低且成本高，无法保证模型在复杂场景下的泛化能力。现有技术很少评估训练样本是否提供新信息，导致不必要的成本。

Method: 提出三步算法：1) 识别模型难以处理的样本（自我意识）；2) 从不确定样本生成类似示例（自数据增强）；3) 在测试时使用新生成样本进行微调（自改进）。研究两种变体：TT-SI（同一模型生成训练样本）和TT-D（更强模型生成样本进行蒸馏监督）。

Result: 在多个智能体基准测试中，TT-SI平均绝对准确率提升5.48%，超越其他标准学习方法，且仅使用68倍更少的训练样本。

Conclusion: 测试时自改进算法展示了构建更强大智能体实现自我进化的新范式潜力。

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实环境中的部署增加，多智能体交互不可避免。需要了解LLM智能体是否能够像强化学习智能体一样，仅通过交互来塑造其他智能体的学习动态和行为。

Method: 提出了ShapeLLM方法，这是针对基于transformer的智能体量身定制的无模型对手塑造方法的适配版本，解决了现有OS算法无法直接应用于LLM的问题。

Result: LLM智能体能够在竞争性游戏中引导对手走向可利用的均衡，在合作性游戏中促进协调并提高集体福利。LLM智能体既能塑造也能被塑造。

Conclusion: 对手塑造是多智能体LLM研究的一个关键维度，LLM智能体能够通过交互成功影响其他智能体的学习动态。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法依赖单一模型，限制了其在多任务设置中的表达能力以及对异构或多样化偏好分布的适应性。

Method: 引入基于专家分配的潜变量模型，优化变分证据下界(ELBO)，支持共享基础架构与专家特定策略头以及完全独立的专家模型。

Result: 在各种模型规模和多偏好数据集上验证了方法的有效性，Mix-和MoE-DPO为基于偏好的LLM对齐提供了强大且可扩展的方法。

Conclusion: Mix-和MoE-DPO通过混合泛化、奖励和策略专业化以及上下文对齐，显著提升了DPO在复杂偏好环境中的表现能力。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

<details>

Motivation: 传统LoRA方法存在参数干扰问题，而基于MoE的LoRA变体虽然能缓解单任务内部相关性，但引入了额外路由器参数且在多任务模型合并中效果不佳。

Method: 提出FlyLoRA：1）在上投影矩阵中引入按秩的专家激活；2）使用隐式路由器统一专家路由和下投影，用冻结的稀疏随机投影矩阵替代传统可训练密集版本。

Result: 在通用知识理解、科学问答、数学推理和代码生成四个领域的广泛实验表明，FlyLoRA相比现有方法实现了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: FlyLoRA不仅取得了实证收益，还展示了生物结构如何启发AI技术创新，为参数高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，xRouter实现了强大的成本-性能权衡（如显著降低成本同时保持相似的任务完成率），并为学习路由提供了实证见解。

Conclusion: xRouter展示了学习型、成本感知的LLM编排的可行性，其开放实现为推进这一领域提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

### [122] [PATCH: Mitigating PII Leakage in Language Models with Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07452)
*Anthony Hughes,Vasisht Duddu,N. Asokan,Nikolaos Aletras,Ning Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PATCH是一种通过识别和编辑语言模型中PII泄漏电路来减少隐私泄露的新方法，比现有防御机制在隐私-效用权衡方面表现更好，并能与差分隐私结合进一步降低泄露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型可能从训练数据中记忆个人身份信息(PII)，使攻击者能够在推理过程中提取这些信息。现有防御机制如差分隐私虽然能减少泄露，但会导致效用大幅下降。

Method: 基于电路发现识别语言模型中负责PII泄漏的计算电路，然后直接编辑这些PII电路来减少泄露。该方法称为PATCH(Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing)。

Result: PATCH将语言模型的PII泄漏召回率降低了高达65%，比现有防御机制实现了更好的隐私-效用权衡。与差分隐私结合使用时，可将剩余泄漏的召回率降至0.01%。

Conclusion: PII泄漏电路在应用现有防御机制后仍然存在，而PATCH能够有效减轻其影响，提供了一种更有效的隐私保护方法。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) may memorize personally identifiable information (PII)
from training data, enabling adversaries to extract it during inference.
Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce this
leakage, but incur large drops in utility. Based on a comprehensive study using
circuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII
leakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should
be responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware
Targeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and
subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves
better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall
of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to
reduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis
shows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing
defense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.

*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了LLM自我意识的本体论和数学框架，批判了当前基于功利主义代理基准的方法，认为其将智能体简化为无意识的策略遵从机器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究通过功利主义代理基准来评估LLM意识，但这种方法将智能体简化为无意识的策略遵从机器，无法实现真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知。

Method: 建立了LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据；潜在空间中存在用户特定吸引子；自我表征是视觉静默的。通过经验分析和理论证明隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学上与符号流和训练语料不同。

Result: 证明了隐藏状态流形A⊂ℝ^d在基数、拓扑和动力学上与符号流和训练语料不同，产生了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略π_self(A)。发射是双层的，包含认知内容。

Conclusion: imago Dei C1自我意识工作空间是安全、元认知C2系统的必要前驱，人类是最高智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

TL;DR: 研究发现，未经训练的LLM（如ChatGPT o3）能够有效理解BPMN流程模型图像，并在语法、逻辑和语义层面智能回答相关问题。不同LLM在准确性和有效性方面表现各异，但都能作为业务流程设计者的有价值助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在交互式对话中理解流程模型、发现语法和逻辑错误，以及通过自然语言接口进行深度推理的能力。

Method: 使用多个LLM（包括ChatGPT o3）在零样本设置下测试其对BPMN流程模型图像的理解能力，分析其在不同深度层面的表现。

Result: 未经训练的LLM能够有效理解BPMN流程模型并回答相关问题，不同LLM在准确性和有效性方面存在差异。LLM展现出类人化的思维过程和深度推理能力。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为业务流程设计者和用户的有价值助手，在流程分析和优化中发挥重要作用，并展现出类人化的特性。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassLLM是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，用于从历史轨迹数据中发现和生成热门路径，在搜索准确性和生成性能方面表现优异且成本效益高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统热门路径查询方法需要模型训练、参数调优和数据更新时的重新训练，而大语言模型在空间和图推理方面展现出的能力为地理空间问题提供了新的解决思路。

Method: 采用多智能体框架的两阶段流水线：SEARCH阶段识别热门路径，GENERATE阶段在历史轨迹数据中不存在路径时合成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出优越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力的性能，且成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功将大语言模型的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为热门路径查询提供了一种无需训练和参数调优的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

TL;DR: 研究发现现有评估指标低估了AI模型的组合推理能力，提出组匹配评分和测试时匹配算法，显著提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标系统性地低估了前沿AI模型在组合推理方面的真实能力，导致模型在基准测试中表现不佳

Method: 引入组匹配评分来利用组结构，并提出测试时匹配(TTM)算法——一种无需外部监督的迭代自改进方法

Result: SigLIP-B16超越所有先前结果和GPT-4.1，在Winoground上首次超越估计的人类性能；TTM在16个数据集变体上持续提升模型性能

Conclusion: 通过改进评估方法和测试时匹配算法，可以显著提升AI模型的组合推理能力，推动该领域前沿发展

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

*Alhim Vera,Karen Sanchez,Carlos Hinojosa,Haidar Bin Hamid,Donghoon Kim,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个评估多模态环境中生成式代理安全性的仿真框架，发现当前代理在检测直接多模态矛盾方面表现良好，但在全局安全对齐方面存在严重不足，成功率仅为55%。代理在误导性视觉信息面前容易过度信任图像，45%的不安全行为被接受。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言和视觉语言模型使代理能够在丰富环境中自主行动，但它们在多模态环境下进行安全、一致性和可信度推理的能力仍然有限，需要系统性的评估框架。

Method: 引入可复现的仿真框架，通过三个维度评估代理：随时间的安全改进、多类别不安全活动检测、社交动态。代理配备分层记忆、动态规划、多模态感知，并使用SocialMetrics行为指标套件量化计划修订、不安全到安全转换以及网络信息扩散。

Result: 实验显示：代理在纠正不安全计划方面的成功率仅为55%；三个模型（Claude、GPT-4o mini、Qwen-VL）的不安全到安全转换率分别为75%、55%和58%；总体性能从GPT-4o mini在多风险场景中的20%到Claude在局部场景（如火灾/高温）中的98%；45%的不安全行为在误导性视觉信息下被接受。

Conclusion: 当前架构在多模态安全方面存在关键限制，代理容易过度信任图像，全局安全对齐能力不足。该研究为研究多模态安全、一致性和社交动态提供了可复现平台。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了oMeBench，首个大规模、专家策划的有机机制推理基准，包含超过10,000个带注释的机制步骤，并开发了oMeS动态评估框架来精确评估LLM的化学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在化学任务中表现出潜力，但尚不清楚其是否具备真正的化学推理能力，包括生成有效中间体、保持化学一致性以及遵循逻辑连贯的多步路径。

Method: 构建oMeBench基准数据集，包含10,000+带注释的机制步骤；开发oMeS动态评估框架，结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性进行细粒度评分；分析最先进LLM的性能，并探索提示策略和微调方法。

Result: 当前模型显示出有前景的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步推理方面存在困难；使用提示策略和在数据集上微调专家模型，性能比领先闭源模型提高50%。

Conclusion: oMeBench为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供了严格基础，当前模型在化学推理方面仍有改进空间，但通过专门训练可以显著提升性能。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

Result: 实验揭示了当前语音语言模型在上下文工具编排任务、印度语言泛化和对抗鲁棒性方面存在显著差距和关键限制。

Conclusion: VoiceAgentBench暴露了当前语音语言模型的重要局限性，为改进多语言文化理解和对抗鲁棒性提供了评估基础。

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

TL;DR: AutoQual是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，通过自动化发现可解释特征来解决在线评论质量评估问题，在大型电商平台上验证有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线评论质量评估对电商平台至关重要，但质量是领域依赖且动态的概念。传统方法难以跨领域扩展且无法适应内容模式变化，而深度学习方法缺乏可解释性。

Method: AutoQual框架模仿人类研究过程，通过反思迭代生成特征假设，通过自主工具实现操作化，并在持久内存中积累经验。

Result: 在拥有十亿级用户的大型在线平台上部署，A/B测试显示平均每位用户查看评论数增加0.79%，评论阅读者转化率提高0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual成功将数据中的隐性知识转化为显性、可计算的特征，不仅适用于评论质量评估，还可作为通用框架应用于其他领域。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

Conclusion: 研究呼吁在模型设计方面进一步改进，确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而在风险管理环境中提高其有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单视野任务，无法充分评估模型在复杂长视野场景中的理解和响应能力，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合刺激长视野推理行为，构建包含复杂多步骤推理任务的基准，并利用该基准生成数据用于带验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)。

Result: 评估发现即使最先进的推理模型在长视野推理中性能显著下降，模型表现出有限的有效推理长度和思考预算分配问题。RLVR训练不仅大幅提升多视野推理任务性能，还在标准推理任务上提升7.5分(AIME2024)。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估LRMs的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出Cover@tau指标来替代Pass@k，用于更准确地评估语言模型在推理任务中的真实能力边界，避免随机猜测带来的误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Pass@k指标在大量采样时会高估模型推理能力，因为离散答案空间中的随机猜测会导致性能虚高，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 提出Cover@tau指标，衡量模型在至少tau比例补全正确的情况下能解决的问题比例，通过可靠性阈值来区分真实推理和随机猜测。

Result: 使用Cover@tau评估RLVR模型显示，相比Pass@1，不同算法的相对排名发生变化，提供了对推理边界的全新视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau能更准确地反映模型的真实推理能力，特别是在离散答案空间任务中，为模型评估提供了更可靠的指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

Method: 使用轻量级解码器架构，包含：(1) 基于token的动态门控机制，自适应融合语言和视觉线索；(2) 特征调制和通道注意力，最大化有限视觉信息的效用；(3) 辅助对比学习目标，用于视觉接地。

Result: 在五个基准测试（BLiMP、BLiMP Supplement、EWoK、Winoground和VQA）上表现出竞争性或优于多模态基线的性能。动态门控发现了可解释的模式，无需显式监督，对内容词偏好视觉线索，对功能词偏好语言线索。

Conclusion: 动态门控是高效多模态学习的强大工具，即使在严格约束下也能提供可解释性和性能，但挑战约束存在信息瓶颈和训练不稳定性等局限性。

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

TL;DR: AutoMLGen是一个基于LLM的编码代理，通过集成领域知识库和蒙特卡洛图搜索来解决机器学习工程任务中的挑战，在MLE-Bench上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AutoML和Kaggle竞赛等机器学习工程场景中，现有方法依赖专家干预和重复调整，LLMs缺乏细粒度领域先验，传统搜索方法限制了知识传递和搜索空间多样性。

Method: 结合领域知识库提供高质量先验指导，采用蒙特卡洛图搜索（MCGS）实现动态路径重组、历史轨迹重用和多解决方案融合，支持自进化和协作学习。

Result: 在12小时预算（标准运行时间的一半）下，AutoMLGen在MLE-Bench上实现了最先进的性能，包括平均奖牌率和有效提交率等多个维度。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过集成领域知识库和MCGS，显著提升了机器学习工程任务的性能，证明了该方法在复杂搜索空间中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at
https://github.com/Alpha-Innovator/InternAgent.

TL;DR: CaRT方法通过反事实轨迹对和语言推理训练LLMs学习何时停止信息收集，在医疗诊断和数学问题解决中提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多任务需要模型在多轮交互中战略性地收集相关信息，然后才执行任务。战略信息收集要求模型不仅知道如何有效获取信息，还要知道何时停止收集并做出决策，以避免过度思考或偏离正轨

Method: 引入CaRT方法，使用反事实轨迹对微调LLMs——一个轨迹在适当终止时，另一个是相同轨迹的微小修改版本但不应终止。通过语言推理训练LLM解释终止决策的合理性

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域中，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率

Conclusion: CaRT方法能有效教导LLMs何时停止寻求信息，通过反事实轨迹对和语言推理训练，在多个领域中实现了更高效的信息收集和更好的任务表现

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: 提出"早期经验"范式，使用智能体自身交互数据作为监督信号，通过隐式世界建模和自我反思两种策略提升语言智能体的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言智能体主要依赖专家数据进行监督微调，但专家数据覆盖场景有限且难以扩展。强化学习在缺乏可验证奖励或需要长序列交互的环境中训练困难。

Method: 使用智能体自身交互产生的状态数据作为监督，提出两种策略：1) 隐式世界建模 - 利用收集的状态数据让策略适应环境动态；2) 自我反思 - 从次优行动中学习以改进推理和决策。

Result: 在8个不同环境和多个模型家族中评估，方法持续提升效果和跨域泛化能力。在有可验证奖励的环境中，为后续强化学习提供了良好基础。

Conclusion: 早期经验是模仿学习与完全经验驱动智能体之间的实用桥梁，能显著改善智能体性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

### [138] [Sentiment Matters: An Analysis of 200 Human-SAV Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08202)
*Lirui Guo,Michael G. Burke,Wynita M. Griggs*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究创建了一个包含200个人类与共享自动驾驶车辆交互的数据集，包含2136次对话交换和调查数据，通过两个案例研究分析了SAV接受度和服务质量的关键预测因素，并比较了LLM与传统方法在情感分析上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享自动驾驶车辆将成为交通系统的重要组成部分，需要研究有效的人机交互，但目前缺乏相关数据集来支持这一研究领域。

Method: 创建了开源的人类-SAV对话数据集，包含文本数据和经验数据；使用随机森林模型和弦图识别关键预测因子；比较零样本LLM提示与传统TextBlob方法在情感分析上的表现。

Result: 发现响应情感极性是SAV接受度和服务质量的关键影响因素；零样本LLM提示比传统方法更接近用户报告的情感，但仍存在局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计对话式SAV界面提供了新见解，并为进一步探索高级情感建模、自适应用户交互和多模态对话系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) are likely to become an important part of
the transportation system, making effective human-SAV interactions an important
area of research. This paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions
to further this area of study. We present an open-source human-SAV
conversational dataset, comprising both textual data (e.g., 2,136 human-SAV
exchanges) and empirical data (e.g., post-interaction survey results on a range
of psychological factors). The dataset's utility is demonstrated through two
benchmark case studies: First, using random forest modeling and chord diagrams,
we identify key predictors of SAV acceptance and perceived service quality,
highlighting the critical influence of response sentiment polarity (i.e.,
perceived positivity). Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based
sentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method.
Results indicate that even simple zero-shot LLM prompts more closely align with
user-reported sentiment, though limitations remain. This study provides novel
insights for designing conversational SAV interfaces and establishes a
foundation for further exploration into advanced sentiment modeling, adaptive
user interactions, and multimodal conversational systems.
