### [1] [Collaborative and Proactive Management of Task-Oriented Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05110)
*Arezoo Saedi,Afsaneh Fatemi,Mohammad Ali Nematbakhsh,Sophie Rosset,Anne Vilnat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息状态方法的任务导向对话管理模型，通过构建中间信息来增强规划能力，利用LLMs实现上下文学习，在MultiWOZ数据集上取得了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务导向对话系统大多基于大语言模型，但忽视了有效的目标感知规划。为了解决这个问题，需要创建一个能够进行主动规划的任务导向对话管理模型。

Method: 基于信息状态方法构建对话管理模型，创建预定义槽位和文本部分信息组件来建模用户偏好，识别关键情况并创建相应的信息组件，定义对话动作和更新策略，利用LLMs的上下文学习实现模型。

Result: 在MultiWOZ数据集上的评估显示，该模型在信息提供和任务成功率方面达到最优，相比之前方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的基于信息状态方法的任务导向对话管理模型能够有效处理中间信息，通过LLMs实现上下文学习，显著提升了对话系统的规划能力和任务完成效果。

Abstract: Task oriented dialogue systems (TOD) complete particular tasks based on user
preferences across natural language interactions. Considering the impressive
performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive
planning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective
goal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented
conversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to
dialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate
information in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part
informational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating
intermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational
components corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible
configurations for these informational components lead to limited information
states. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information
states and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.
Eventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is
implemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database
queries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of
retrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables
passing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of
congruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ,
with no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and
success, and improvement compared with previous methods.

### [2] [Trainable Reference-Based Evaluation Metric for Identifying Quality of English-Gujarati Machine Translation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05113)
*Nisheeth Joshi,Pragya Katyayan,Palak Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于监督学习的古吉拉特语机器翻译评估指标，使用25个特征训练了两个神经网络模型（6层和10层隐藏层），在1000个MT系统输出上测试，相比现有指标获得了更好的人工相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译评估方法对英语和欧洲语言有效，但不适用于印度语言，需要专门为古吉拉特语开发有效的评估指标。

Method: 使用监督学习方法，基于25个特征训练了两个神经网络模型（6层和10层隐藏层，各500轮训练），在7个MT系统的1000个输出上与人工参考翻译进行比较。

Result: 开发的评估指标在测试中表现出比现有指标更好的人工相关性，能够有效评估古吉拉特语机器翻译系统的性能。

Conclusion: 成功开发了针对古吉拉特语的参考型机器翻译评估指标，该方法对其他印度语言的MT评估也具有借鉴意义。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation is an integral part of the MT development
life cycle. Without analyzing the outputs of MT engines, it is impossible to
evaluate the performance of an MT system. Through experiments, it has been
identified that what works for English and other European languages does not
work well with Indian languages. Thus, In this paper, we have introduced a
reference-based MT evaluation metric for Gujarati which is based on supervised
learning. We have trained two versions of the metric which uses 25 features for
training. Among the two models, one model is trained using 6 hidden layers with
500 epochs while the other model is trained using 10 hidden layers with 500
epochs. To test the performance of the metric, we collected 1000 MT outputs of
seven MT systems. These MT engine outputs were compared with 1 human reference
translation. While comparing the developed metrics with other available
metrics, it was found that the metrics produced better human correlations.

### [3] [Hallucination is Inevitable for LLMs with the Open World Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05116)
*Bowen Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文将LLM的幻觉重新定义为泛化问题的表现，认为在封闭世界假设下可缓解，但在开放世界假设下不可避免，建议将其视为结构性特征而非工程缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究要么将幻觉视为需要最小化的缺陷，要么认为其理论上不可避免，但都未充分考虑AGI所需的条件。本文旨在从泛化问题的角度重新理解幻觉现象。

Method: 通过区分封闭世界和开放世界假设，分析幻觉在不同环境下的表现，并建立幻觉分类体系来区分可纠正和不可避免的幻觉类型。

Result: 研究表明在开放世界条件下，某些类型的幻觉是不可避免的，这挑战了将幻觉纯粹视为工程缺陷的传统观点。

Conclusion: 幻觉应被视为LLM的结构性特征，需要被容忍并与人类智能兼容，而非仅仅作为需要消除的缺陷。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic competence but
also produce inaccurate or fabricated outputs, often called ``hallucinations''.
Engineering approaches usually regard hallucination as a defect to be
minimized, while formal analyses have argued for its theoretical inevitability.
Yet both perspectives remain incomplete when considering the conditions
required for artificial general intelligence (AGI). This paper reframes
``hallucination'' as a manifestation of the generalization problem. Under the
Closed World assumption, where training and test distributions are consistent,
hallucinations may be mitigated. Under the Open World assumption, however,
where the environment is unbounded, hallucinations become inevitable. This
paper further develops a classification of hallucination, distinguishing cases
that may be corrected from those that appear unavoidable under open-world
conditions. On this basis, it suggests that ``hallucination'' should be
approached not merely as an engineering defect but as a structural feature to
be tolerated and made compatible with human intelligence.

### [4] [Towards Structured Knowledge: Advancing Triple Extraction from Regional Trade Agreements using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05121)
*Durgesh Nandini,Rebekka Koch,Mirco Schoenfeld*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型在经济学领域从非结构化文本中提取结构化知识三元组（主体-谓词-客体）的有效性，特别关注零样本、单样本和少样本提示技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在经济学应用中提取结构化知识的潜力，特别是从自然语言法律贸易协议文本创建经济贸易知识图谱。

Method: 使用Llama 3.1模型处理非结构化区域贸易协议文本，采用零样本、单样本和少样本提示技术，并结合正负示例进行三元组提取。

Result: 基于定量和定性指标评估了不同提示技术的性能，讨论了关键见解、挑战和潜在应用。

Conclusion: 强调了语言模型在经济学应用中的重要性，为从法律文本自动构建知识图谱提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
the extraction of structured knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object
triples. We apply the setup for the domain of Economics application. The
findings can be applied to a wide range of scenarios, including the creation of
economic trade knowledge graphs from natural language legal trade agreement
texts. As a use case, we apply the model to regional trade agreement texts to
extract trade-related information triples. In particular, we explore the
zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot prompting techniques, incorporating positive
and negative examples, and evaluate their performance based on quantitative and
qualitative metrics. Specifically, we used Llama 3.1 model to process the
unstructured regional trade agreement texts and extract triples. We discuss key
insights, challenges, and potential future directions, emphasizing the
significance of language models in economic applications.

### [5] [CARE: Cognitive-reasoning Augmented Reinforcement for Emotional Support Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05122)
*Jie Zhu,Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARE框架通过强化认知推理过程来提升情感支持对话的质量，不依赖大规模合成数据，而是利用原始训练集生成逻辑一致且支持性的回复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注数据增强和合成语料构建，但忽略了支撑有效情感支持的深层认知推理过程。

Method: 利用原始ESC训练集引导模型生成逻辑一致的回复，并采用强化学习来细化和强化推理过程。

Result: 实验结果表明CARE显著提高了回复的逻辑合理性和支持性质量。

Conclusion: CARE推动了具有同理心、认知鲁棒性和类人特征的情感支持系统的发展。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) plays a vital role in alleviating
psychological stress and providing emotional value through dialogue. While
recent studies have largely focused on data augmentation and synthetic corpus
construction, they often overlook the deeper cognitive reasoning processes that
underpin effective emotional support. To address this gap, we propose
\textbf{CARE}, a novel framework that strengthens reasoning in ESC without
relying on large-scale synthetic data. CARE leverages the original ESC training
set to guide models in generating logically coherent and supportive responses,
thereby explicitly enhancing cognitive reasoning. Building on this foundation,
we further employ reinforcement learning to refine and reinforce the reasoning
process. Experimental results demonstrate that CARE significantly improves both
the logical soundness and supportive quality of responses, advancing the
development of empathetic, cognitively robust, and human-like emotional support
systems.

### [6] [MADS: Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation for Diverse Persuasion Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05124)
*Mingjin Li,Yu Liu,Huayi Liu,Xiang Ye,Chao Jiang,Hongguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MADS是一个通过智能体自我博弈生成多轮说服对话的可扩展框架，包含用户代理、对话代理和优化代理三个协调智能体，无需人工标注即可低成本生成训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决行业关键挑战：缺乏用户数据、冷启动评估困难和提示效率低下，旨在通过自动生成对话数据提升小模型的劝说能力。

Method: 采用三个协调智能体：模拟多样化用户行为的用户代理、执行任务导向劝说策略的对话代理、评估和优化对话结果的优化代理，并通过用户态度链建模和专用LLM劝说评估验证有效性。

Result: 在真实营销场景中，MADS显著提升了小LLM的劝说能力，将有机流量转化率从1.83%提高到2.24%，提升了22.4%。

Conclusion: MADS框架能够有效生成高质量说服对话数据，显著提升小模型的业务表现，展示了明确的商业价值。

Abstract: We propose MADS (Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation), a scalable framework for
generating persuasive multi-turn dialogues via agent self-play. MADS employs
three coordinated agents: User Agents simulating diverse persona-driven
behaviors, a Dialog Agent executing task-oriented persuasion strategies and an
Optimization Agent evaluating and refining dialogue outcomes. We further
validate its effectiveness through users' Chain-of-Attitude (CoA) modeling and
dedicated LLMs' persuasion assessment. This approach enables low-cost
generation of training data without human annotation, addressing key industry
challenges such as lack of user data, cold-start evaluation difficulties, and
prompt inefficiency. Applied to a real-world marketing scenario, MADS
significantly improved the persuasion capacity of small LLMs, increasing the
organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4\% (from 1.83\% to 2.24\%) ,
demonstrating clear business value.

### [7] [Catalog-Native LLM: Speaking Item-ID Dialect with Less Entanglement for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05125)
*Reza Shirkavand,Xiaokai Wei,Chen Wang,Zheng Hui,Heng Huang,Michelle Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IDIOMoE通过将物品交互历史视为语言空间中的方言，使用混合专家架构分离文本和物品专家，实现协同过滤信号与语言模型的统一理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统需要结合协同过滤的预测准确性和效率与LLMs的表达性和泛化推理能力，以满足用户对自然语言查询和透明解释的期望。

Method: 在预训练LLM的每个块中将前馈网络拆分为文本专家和物品专家，通过token类型门控避免模态间破坏性干扰。

Result: 在公共和专有数据集上均表现出强大的推荐性能，同时保持了预训练模型的文本理解能力。

Conclusion: IDIOMoE成功统一了协同信号和语言理解，为现代推荐系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While collaborative filtering delivers predictive accuracy and efficiency,
and Large Language Models (LLMs) enable expressive and generalizable reasoning,
modern recommendation systems must bring these strengths together. Growing user
expectations, such as natural-language queries and transparent explanations,
further highlight the need for a unified approach. However, doing so is
nontrivial. Collaborative signals are often token-efficient but semantically
opaque, while LLMs are semantically rich but struggle to model implicit user
preferences when trained only on textual inputs. This paper introduces Item-ID
+ Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE), which treats item
interaction histories as a native dialect within the language space, enabling
collaborative signals to be understood in the same way as natural language. By
splitting the Feed Forward Network of each block of a pretrained LLM into a
separate text expert and an item expert with token-type gating, our method
avoids destructive interference between text and catalog modalities. IDIOMoE
demonstrates strong recommendation performance across both public and
proprietary datasets, while preserving the text understanding of the pretrained
model.

### [8] [Improving Metacognition and Uncertainty Communication in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05126)
*Mark Steyvers,Catarina Belem,Padhraic Smyth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过监督微调可以改进大语言模型的不确定性表达能力，但不同元认知技能需要多任务训练才能共同提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在决策场景中应用增多，但其显式表达的置信度通常校准不佳，无法有效区分正确和错误答案，用户可能在不知情的情况下依赖错误输出

Method: 对两种大语言模型在通用知识、数学和开放式问答数据集上进行监督微调，评估两种元认知任务：单问题置信度估计和成对置信度比较，并测试在医疗和法律推理等未见领域的泛化能力

Result: 微调改善了校准（置信度与准确性的对齐）和区分度（正确回答的置信度高于错误回答），同时保持准确性不变。但改进具有任务特异性，多任务微调在跨领域评估中产生更广泛的增益

Conclusion: LLM的不确定性表达能力是可训练和可泛化的，但不同的元认知技能不会自然相互强化，必须通过多任务训练共同发展

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making
contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users
may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. While prior work shows that LLMs
maintain internal uncertainty signals, their explicit verbalized confidence is
typically miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect
answers. Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning
can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such
improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on
datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and
evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation,
where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise
confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more
likely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including
medical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration
(alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher
confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains,
while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific:
training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise
comparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of
metacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and
stronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. These results show that
while uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable and generalizable,
different metacognitive skills do not naturally reinforce one another and must
be developed together through multitask training.

*Si-Ioi Ng,Pranav S. Ambadi,Kimberly D. Mueller,Julie Liss,Visar Berisha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于BERT的自动化CIU提取和排序方法，用于从图片描述中评估认知语言障碍，相比传统方法更高效准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估认知语言障碍的自动化方法忽略了视觉叙事路径，而手动标注或基于词典的方法效率低下。

Method: 使用基于BERT的管道，通过二元交叉熵和成对排序损失进行微调，自动从Cookie Theft图片描述中提取和排序内容信息单元(CIUs)。

Result: 5折交叉验证显示：CIU检测中位数精度93%，召回率96%，序列错误率24%；提取的特征与真实值有强相关性，在外部验证中优于基于词典的基线。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效表征视觉叙事路径用于认知障碍评估，实现和模型已开源。

Abstract: Current methods for automated assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment
via picture description often neglect the visual narrative path - the sequence
and locations of elements a speaker described in the picture. Analyses of
spatio-semantic features capture this path using content information units
(CIUs), but manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping is labor-intensive. This
study proposes a BERT-based pipeline, fine tuned with binary cross-entropy and
pairwise ranking loss, for automated CIU extraction and ordering from the
Cookie Theft picture description. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, and 24%
sequence error rates. The proposed method extracts features that exhibit strong
Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpassing the dictionary-based
baseline in external validation. These features also perform comparably to
those derived from manual annotations in evaluating group differences via
ANCOVA. The pipeline is shown to effectively characterize visual narrative
paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with the implementation and models
open-sourced to public.

### [10] [Automated Alignment of Math Items to Content Standards in Large-Scale Assessments Using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05129)
*Qingshu Xu,Hong Jiao,Tianyi Zhou,Ming Li,Nan Zhang,Sydney Peters,Yanbin Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种自动化方法用于项目与内容标准的对齐，包括基于嵌入的机器学习模型、BERT模型微调以及集成学习。DeBERTa-v3-base在领域对齐中表现最佳，RoBERTa-large在技能对齐中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模评估中，项目与内容标准的准确对齐对于有效分数解释至关重要，需要探索自动化的对齐方法。

Method: 1) 提取嵌入并训练经典监督机器学习模型；2) 微调8个BERT模型及其变体；3) 探索多数投票和堆叠的集成学习方法。

Result: DeBERTa-v3-base在领域对齐中获得最高加权平均F1分数0.950，RoBERTa-large在技能对齐中获得最高F1分数0.869。集成模型未超越最佳语言模型，维度缩减提升了基于嵌入的线性分类器性能。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了自动化项目与内容标准对齐的不同方法，语言模型在两种对齐任务中都表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate alignment of items to content standards is critical for valid score
interpretation in large-scale assessments. This study evaluates three automated
paradigms for aligning items with four domain and nineteen skill labels. First,
we extracted embeddings and trained multiple classical supervised machine
learning models, and further investigated the impact of dimensionality
reduction on model performance. Second, we fine-tuned eight BERT model and its
variants for both domain and skill alignment. Third, we explored ensemble
learning with majority voting and stacking with multiple meta-models. The
DeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for
domain alignment while the RoBERTa-large yielded the highest F1 score of 0.869
for skill alignment. Ensemble models did not surpass the best-performing
language models. Dimension reduction enhanced linear classifiers based on
embeddings but did not perform better than language models. This study
demonstrated different methods in automated item alignment to content
standards.}

### [11] [Submodular Context Partitioning and Compression for In-Context Learning-short paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05130)
*Shaoyi Zheng,Canyu Zhang,Tianyi Zhou,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sub-CP是一个基于子模目标的块感知上下文选择框架，通过控制块多样性来解决ICL中因不同分区策略导致的信息冗余或表示不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高效ICL方法在处理上下文时通常忽略不同分区策略造成的信息冗余或表示不足，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出Sub-CP框架，利用子模目标控制块多样性，支持从全局多样性到局部一致性的灵活选择策略，同时支持预计算。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Sub-CP在不同模型规模下都能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: Sub-CP通过精细控制语义结构，有效解决了ICL中的上下文选择问题，显著提升了few-shot学习性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables efficient few-shot learning in large
language models (LLMs) without training, but suffers from the quadratic input
complexity of transformers, limiting the maximum number of exemplars. While
various efficient ICL approaches partition the context into blocks to process
(e.g., ensembling, compression, cross-attention), they often ignore the
information redundancy or under-representation caused by different partition
strategies, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle this problem, we
propose Sub-CP, a block-aware context selection framework that leverages
submodular objectives to control block diversity. Sub-CP supports a flexible
spectrum of selection strategies, allowing each block to range from globally
diverse to locally coherent. This allows fine-grained control over semantic
structure while enabling precomputation. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks on multiple datasets show that Sub-CP consistently improves performance
across model scales.

### [12] [Rationale-Augmented Retrieval with Constrained LLM Re-Ranking for Task Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05131)
*Bowen Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种混合语义搜索系统，结合词汇检索、向量相似度和LLM重排序，解决Head Start项目中GoEngage平台的任务查找问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head Start项目工作人员在GoEngage平台上难以找到合适任务模块，原因包括专业术语、系统特定名称以及词汇搜索的局限性

Method: 采用混合语义搜索方法，结合轻量级容错词汇检索、基于嵌入的向量相似度和约束性LLM重排序，利用现有任务库和知识库基础设施

Result: 提供了完整的实施框架，包括资源需求、分阶段实施策略、离线评估协议和在线测量方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过低误报率、适应术语变化的能力和经济高效性，确保系统的可信度、可演进性和成本效益

Abstract: Head Start programs utilizing GoEngage face significant challenges when new
or rotating staff attempt to locate appropriate Tasks (modules) on the platform
homepage. These difficulties arise from domain-specific jargon (e.g., IFPA,
DRDP), system-specific nomenclature (e.g., Application Pool), and the inherent
limitations of lexical search in handling typos and varied word ordering. We
propose a pragmatic hybrid semantic search system that synergistically combines
lightweight typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, embedding-based vector similarity,
and constrained large language model (LLM) re-ranking. Our approach leverages
the organization's existing Task Repository and Knowledge Base infrastructure
while ensuring trustworthiness through low false-positive rates, evolvability
to accommodate terminological changes, and economic efficiency via intelligent
caching, shortlist generation, and graceful degradation mechanisms. We provide
a comprehensive framework detailing required resources, a phased implementation
strategy with concrete milestones, an offline evaluation protocol utilizing
curated test cases (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR), and an online
measurement methodology incorporating query success metrics, zero-result rates,
and dwell-time proxies.

### [13] [Training Large Language Models To Reason In Parallel With Global Forking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05132)
*Sheng Jia,Xiao Wang,Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT)方法，通过集合式全局损失和自监督二分匹配来保持推理路径的多样性，解决并行推理中多样性与准确性的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在并行测试时计算中需要生成既多样又准确的推理路径，但触发多样且正确推理模式的分叉标记通常位于采样树深处，传统方法如温度缩放面临多样性与准确性之间的权衡恶化。

Method: 将并行推理视为集合式下一个标记预测问题，在监督微调中引入基于集合的全局损失，使用自监督二分匹配将全局分叉标记与唯一推理轨迹进行匹配。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，SSFT在Pass@1和Cons@k指标下始终优于标准SFT，能够保持独特的推理模式并产生涌现的全局分叉标记。

Conclusion: SSFT方法有效解决了并行推理中多样性与准确性的权衡问题，通过集合式监督微调提升了LLMs的推理性能。

Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel
test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both
diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger
diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree.
Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature
scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy.
Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a
set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss
into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching
between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that,
while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique
reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT),
preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments
on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms
SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了合成数据比例对模型性能的影响，发现模型在20%合成数据内保持稳定性能，超过30%后性能加速下降，大模型对合成数据更具鲁棒性，校准退化先于准确率损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统理解合成数据比例如何影响不同规模模型的行为，为实践者提供合成数据使用的实用指导。

Method: 使用Pythia模型套件（410M-12B参数）在五个不同任务上进行控制实验，评估模型在合成数据比例0-50%范围内经过1-3次训练迭代后的表现。

Result: 模型在20%合成数据内性能稳定，超过30%后加速下降；大模型（6.9B-12B）比小模型（410M-1.4B）对合成数据更具鲁棒性；校准退化先于准确率损失；推理任务比检索任务在合成数据训练下退化更快。

Conclusion: 当前最佳实践（如STaR和Self-Instruct系统保持大于80%外部数据）处于安全范围内，提供了基于模型规模和任务需求的合成数据预算实用指南。

Abstract: Synthetic data generated by large language models has become integral to
modern NLP training pipelines, from bootstrapping reasoning capabilities to
augmenting instruction-following datasets. While recent work demonstrates
successful applications maintaining high external data ratios, systematic
understanding of how synthetic data proportion affects model behavior across
different scales remains limited. This paper presents a controlled empirical
study examining model performance, calibration, and output characteristics when
trained on varying synthetic-to-external data ratios. Using the Pythia model
suite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, we evaluate models after
one to three training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from
0-50\%. Our key findings include: models maintain stable performance with up to
20\% synthetic data, but degradation accelerates beyond 30\%; larger models
(6.9B-12B) show greater robustness to synthetic data than smaller models
(410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss, providing an early
warning signal; and task characteristics matter, with reasoning tasks degrading
faster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training. Importantly, we find
that current best practices, such as those employed in STaR and Self-Instruct
systems that maintain greater than 80\% external data, operate well within safe
regimes identified by our experiments. We provide practical guidance for
practitioners on synthetic data budgets based on model scale and task
requirements, alongside detailed comparison with concurrent work including
Shumailov et al.'s model collapse findings.

Motivation: 现代大语言模型在客观任务上表现出色，但在评估创意等主观任务时表现不佳，需要个性化的创意判断方法。

Method: 使用好奇心驱动的LLM作为评估者，学习个体化的创意判断，在Torrance创造性思维测试基准上进行验证。

Result: 该方法在不同规模的模型上都优于基线监督微调方法，在皮尔逊相关性、Cohen's和F1值等指标上均有提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在主观评估中特别有效，尤其是在标注者意见不一致的情况下，能够学习不同个体的细微创意判断。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at objective tasks such as
evaluating mathematical reasoning and factual accuracy, yet they falter when
faced with the nuanced, subjective nature of assessing creativity. In this
work, we propose a novel curiosity-driven LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating
creative writing which is personlized to each individual's creative judgments.
We use the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking(TTCW) benchmark introduced in
Chakrabarty et al. (2024), which has stories annotated by expert humans across
various subjective dimensions like Originality, to test our hypothesis. We show
that our method enables models across various sizes, to learn the nuanced
creative judgments of different individuals, by showing improvements over
baseline supervised finetuning(SFT) method across various evaluation metrics
like Pearson correlation, Cohen's and F1 values. Our method is especially
useful in subjective evaluations where not all the annotators agree with each
other.

### [16] [Linguistic Characteristics of AI-Generated Text: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05136)
*Luka Terčon,Kaja Dobrovoljc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇综述论文系统分析了AI生成文本的语言特征研究现状，发现AI文本通常更正式、非个人化，词汇多样性较低，且研究主要集中在英语和GPT模型上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，需要系统研究AI生成文本的语言特征及其对语料库语言学、计算语言学和自然语言处理等领域的影响。

Method: 通过分类现有研究，从语言描述层次、模型类型、文本体裁、语言种类和提示方法等多个维度进行综合分析。

Result: AI生成文本通常包含更多名词、限定词和介词，较少使用形容词和副词，词汇多样性较低，词汇量较小，且文本重复性较高。

Conclusion: 当前研究主要集中于英语数据和GPT模型，需要更多跨语言和跨模型的研究，以及关注提示敏感性问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are solidifying their position in the modern
world as effective tools for the automatic generation of text. Their use is
quickly becoming commonplace in fields such as education, healthcare, and
scientific research. There is a growing need to study the linguistic features
present in AI-generated text, as the increasing presence of such texts has
profound implications in various disciplines such as corpus linguistics,
computational linguistics, and natural language processing. Many observations
have already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far
is required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey
paper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the
existing works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic
description, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed,
and the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present
the findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers.
Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated
text is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by
the increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower
reliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to
feature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive
text. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data
and mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for
broader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors
also fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for
future studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation
phase.

*Maojia Song,Renhang Liu,Xinyu Wang,Yong Jiang,Pengjun Xie,Fei Huang,Soujanya Poria,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebDetective是一个用于评估RAG系统和网络代理的多跳深度搜索任务的基准，通过无提示问题和可控维基百科沙盒确保模型行为完全可追溯，并提供分离搜索充分性、知识利用和拒绝行为的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估实践存在两个主要局限：1) 大多数基准在问题文本中泄露推理路径，使模型能够遵循表面线索而非自主发现推理链；2) 评估通常简化为单一通过率，将多样化行为压缩为一个分数，掩盖了失败是由于搜索不足、知识使用不佳还是不适当拒绝导致的。

Method: 开发了WebDetective基准，包含无提示多跳问题和可控维基百科沙盒，确保模型行为完全可追溯，并建立了分离搜索充分性、知识利用和拒绝行为的整体评估框架。

Result: 对25个最先进模型的评估显示所有架构都存在系统性弱点：模型尽管有足够证据却难以利用知识，在缺乏证据时几乎不会适当拒绝。这些模式暴露了一个根本差距：当今系统擅长执行给定推理路径，但在需要发现推理路径时失败。

Conclusion: 开发了EvidenceLoop代理工作流程，明确针对基准识别的挑战，通过整合验证循环和系统证据跟踪来改进搜索和综合能力。WebDetective的诊断框架可以指导具体的架构改进，使其成为开发真正自主推理系统而非模式跟随代理的关键工具。

Abstract: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly
evaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two
major limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the
question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover
reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a
single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and
obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or
inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a
benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia
sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic
evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation,
and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals
systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge
utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent
appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a
fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but
fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow,
EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies,
incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve
both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that
WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural
improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing
genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献快速增长使得保持文献综述的全面性和时效性变得困难，现有研究主要关注自动检索和筛选，而综述写作阶段特别是可读性和事实准确性方面研究不足。

Method: 采用多智能体协作工作流，包含内容提纲、子章节写作、编辑和审阅等专门智能体，模拟人类文献综述过程。

Result: 在SciReviewGen和ScienceDirect数据集上评估，LiRA在写作和引用质量方面优于AutoSurvey和MASS-Survey等基线方法，同时与人工撰写综述保持相当的相似性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，即使没有领域特定调优，基于智能体的大语言模型工作流也有潜力提高自动化科学写作的可靠性和可用性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific publications has made it increasingly
difficult to keep literature reviews comprehensive and up-to-date. Though prior
work has focused on automating retrieval and screening, the writing phase of
systematic reviews remains largely under-explored, especially with regard to
readability and factual accuracy. To address this, we present LiRA (Literature
Review Agents), a multi-agent collaborative workflow which emulates the human
literature review process. LiRA utilizes specialized agents for content
outlining, subsection writing, editing, and reviewing, producing cohesive and
comprehensive review articles. Evaluated on SciReviewGen and a proprietary
ScienceDirect dataset, LiRA outperforms current baselines such as AutoSurvey
and MASS-Survey in writing and citation quality, while maintaining competitive
similarity to human-written reviews. We further evaluate LiRA in real-world
scenarios using document retrieval and assess its robustness to reviewer model
variation. Our findings highlight the potential of agentic LLM workflows, even
without domain-specific tuning, to improve the reliability and usability of
automated scientific writing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要系统评估语言模型在自然语言描述任务中的表现，特别是生成准确简洁的源代码描述的能力。

Method: 构建了包含多种Transformer模型的NLD-LLM框架，采用全面的提示设计策略和迭代优化过程，使用语义和结构指标进行评估。

Result: 提示工程显著影响模型效果，小型模型在良好提示支持下表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示策略可以显著提升语言模型在自然语言描述任务中的性能，使小型模型也能达到与大模型相媲美的效果。

Abstract: Natural Language Description (NLD) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP)
task that requires models to generate structured and meaningful outputs from
natural language inputs. In this work, we propose NLD-LLM, a systematic NLP
framework to evaluate the performance of language models to generate accurate
and concise source code descriptions. This framework incorporates a diverse set
of transformer models, including Qwen, DeepSeek, Phi, LLaMA, and Mistral,
spanning various sizes, architectures, and training approaches. Central to
NLD-LLM is a comprehensive prompt design strategy that includes standardized
formatting, clear task guidance, and NLD prompting, ensuring fair and
consistent evaluation. Additionally, we apply an iterative refinement process
to improve output's quality and assess the model's adaptability. Using semantic
and structural metrics, our analysis demonstrates that prompt engineering
significantly impacts the effectiveness of the model such that smaller models
often performing competitively when supported by well-crafted prompts.

*Byung-Doh Oh,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在预测下一个词方面表现优于人类，但作为人类语言预测的认知模型时，其预测人类阅读行为的能力反而下降，因为它们是'超人类'的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型作为人类语言预测认知模型的能力，发现随着模型预测能力的提升，其预测人类阅读行为的能力反而下降，这促使研究者分析造成这种'超人类'现象的原因。

Method: 分析大型语言模型与人类在语言预测方面的差异，识别出两个主要因素：长期记忆（对事实和训练样本的记忆）和短期记忆（对文本中先前词语的记忆）的差异。

Result: 发现大型语言模型在长期记忆和短期记忆方面都远超人类，这导致它们能更好地预测下一个词，但无法准确预测人类的阅读行为。

Conclusion: 需要开发具有人类类似长期和短期记忆能力的模型，并指出当前可用的人类数据不足以衡量这一目标的进展，建议进行新的人类实验来填补这一空白。

Abstract: When people listen to or read a sentence, they actively make predictions
about upcoming words: words that are less predictable are generally read more
slowly than predictable ones. The success of large language models (LLMs),
which, like humans, make predictions about upcoming words, has motivated
exploring the use of these models as cognitive models of human linguistic
prediction. Surprisingly, in the last few years, as language models have become
better at predicting the next word, their ability to predict human reading
behavior has declined. This is because LLMs are able to predict upcoming words
much better than people can, leading them to predict lower processing
difficulty in reading than observed in human experiments; in other words,
mainstream LLMs are 'superhuman' as models of language comprehension. In this
position paper, we argue that LLMs' superhumanness is primarily driven by two
factors: compared to humans, LLMs have much stronger long-term memory for facts
and training examples, and they have much better short-term memory for previous
words in the text. We advocate for creating models that have human-like
long-term and short-term memory, and outline some possible directions for
achieving this goal. Finally, we argue that currently available human data is
insufficient to measure progress towards this goal, and outline human
experiments that can address this gap.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于大语言模型的多阶段信息提取流水线，从实验报告的材料文献中提取47个特征，涵盖成分、加工、微观结构和性能，实现了高精度的材料信息提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决材料发现中大量信息被困在非结构化文献中的问题，现有提取方法通常只关注有限特征集，未能解决理解材料行为所必需的成分-加工-微观结构-性能综合关系。

Method: 使用大语言模型驱动的多阶段信息提取流水线，集成迭代提取和来源追踪，从实验报告的材料中提取47个特征。

Result: 在特征级和元组级评估中F1分数约为0.96，与无来源追踪的单次提取相比，微观结构类别的F1分数分别提高了10.0%和13.7%，在396种材料中遗漏材料从49个减少到13个（遗漏率从12.4%降至3.3%）。

Conclusion: 该流水线实现了可扩展和高效的文献挖掘，产生高精度、最小遗漏和零误报的数据库，为机器学习和材料信息学提供可信输入，模块化设计可推广到不同材料类别。

Abstract: Data-driven materials discovery requires large-scale experimental datasets,
yet most of the information remains trapped in unstructured literature.
Existing extraction efforts often focus on a limited set of features and have
not addressed the integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property
relationships essential for understanding materials behavior, thereby posing
challenges for building comprehensive databases. To address this gap, we
propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language
models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing,
microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported
materials. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to
enhance both accuracy and reliability. Evaluations at the feature level
(independent attributes) and tuple level (interdependent features) yielded F1
scores around 0.96. Compared with single-pass extraction without source
tracking, our approach improved F1 scores of microstructure category by 10.0%
(feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level), and reduced missed materials from 49
to 13 out of 396 materials in 100 articles on precipitate-containing
multi-principal element alloys (miss rate reduced from 12.4% to 3.3%). The
pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases
with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives. These
datasets provide trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials
informatics, while the modular design generalizes to diverse material classes,
enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SynCED-EnDe数据集，这是一个用于机器翻译关键错误检测的新资源，包含1,000个黄金标注和8,000个白银标注的句子对，平衡了错误和非错误案例，并引入了细粒度的错误子类和辅助判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的WMT21英德CED数据集在规模、标签平衡、领域覆盖和时间新鲜度方面存在限制，需要更全面和平衡的数据集来推动机器翻译安全部署。

Method: 创建了SynCED-EnDe数据集，从2024-2025年的多样化来源（StackExchange、GOV.UK）收集数据，引入明确的错误子类、结构化触发标志和细粒度的辅助判断（明显性、严重性、定位复杂性、上下文依赖性、充分性偏差）。

Result: 使用XLM-R和相关编码器的基准实验显示，由于平衡标签和精细化标注，性能相比WMT21有显著提升。

Conclusion: SynCED-EnDe可作为社区资源，推动机器翻译在信息检索和对话助手（特别是可穿戴AI设备等新兴场景）中的安全部署。

Abstract: Critical Error Detection (CED) in machine translation aims to determine
whether a translation is safe to use or contains unacceptable deviations in
meaning. While the WMT21 English-German CED dataset provided the first
benchmark, it is limited in scale, label balance, domain coverage, and temporal
freshness. We present SynCED-EnDe, a new resource consisting of 1,000
gold-labeled and 8,000 silver-labeled sentence pairs, balanced 50/50 between
error and non-error cases. SynCED-EnDe draws from diverse 2024-2025 sources
(StackExchange, GOV.UK) and introduces explicit error subclasses, structured
trigger flags, and fine-grained auxiliary judgments (obviousness, severity,
localization complexity, contextual dependency, adequacy deviation). These
enrichments enable systematic analyses of error risk and intricacy beyond
binary detection. The dataset is permanently hosted on GitHub and Hugging Face,
accompanied by documentation, annotation guidelines, and baseline scripts.
Benchmark experiments with XLM-R and related encoders show substantial
performance gains over WMT21 due to balanced labels and refined annotations. We
envision SynCED-EnDe as a community resource to advance safe deployment of MT
in information retrieval and conversational assistants, particularly in
emerging contexts such as wearable AI devices.

*Qi Li,Runpeng Yu,Haiquan Lu,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于离散扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)解码轨迹的模型归属方法，通过提取有向解码映射(DDM)结构信息和采用高斯轨迹归属(GTA)算法，有效解决了不同模型和同一模型不同检查点之间的归属问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs的非自回归解码机制不仅提升了模型性能，还蕴含了丰富的模型特征信息。然而，由于双向解码特性导致模型置信度信息冗余，难以直接用于模型归属。本文旨在利用dLLMs解码轨迹中的结构信息来解决多样化的模型归属场景。

Method: 1. 提出有向解码映射(DDM)来提取解码步骤间的结构关系，避免直接使用冗余的模型置信度；2. 设计高斯轨迹归属(GTA)算法，为每个目标模型在每个解码位置拟合单元高斯分布，通过计算轨迹的似然度来进行模型归属。

Result: 在不同设置下的广泛实验验证了所提方法的有效性，能够准确区分不同模型以及同一模型的不同检查点。

Conclusion: dLLMs的解码轨迹包含丰富的模型特征信息，通过DDM和GTA方法可以有效提取和利用这些信息，为模型归属提供了一种强大的工具。

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
competitive paradigm for non-autoregressive language modeling. Their
distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong
performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show
that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also
can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this
problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including
distinguishing between different models as well as between different
checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we
identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the
decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that
relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is
mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded
token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model
confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding
decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel
information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which
captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals
model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted
structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory
Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each
decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a
trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher
log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to
have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different
settings validate the utility of our methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chronological Thinking的实时对话思考机制，用于改进全双工语音对话语言模型，通过在听音阶段进行轻量级思考来提升响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全双工系统在听音阶段让代理保持空闲，重复预测静音标记，这与人类在对话中通常进行轻量思考的行为不符。

Method: Chronological Thinking机制：严格因果性（仅基于过去音频增量推理）、无额外延迟（在听音窗口内分摊推理，用户停止说话后立即开始响应）。

Result: 实验通过客观指标和人工评估显示响应质量持续改善，并能稳健处理对话动态，在全双工交互指标上达到竞争性表现。

Conclusion: Chronological Thinking为全双工语音对话系统提供了一种有效的实时思考机制，显著提升了响应质量和交互体验。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken dialogue language models (SDLMs) reflect growing
interest in shifting from turn-based to full-duplex systems, where the models
continuously perceive user speech streams while generating responses. This
simultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and
the agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in.
However, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by
repeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we
usually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than
remaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a
on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response
quality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a
paradigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as
Chain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly
causal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal
hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency:
reasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops
speaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through
both objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in
response quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles
conversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex
interaction metrics.

Method: 基于PIXIU框架构建FinMA模型，使用金融指令调优数据集进行指令调优，并在FLARE基准下进行评估。

Result: FinMA在情感分析和分类任务中表现良好，但在数值推理、实体识别和摘要任务中存在显著困难。

Conclusion: 这项研究推进了对金融大语言模型如何有效设计和评估的理解，以支持金融相关决策过程。

Abstract: This research explores the strengths and weaknesses of domain-adapted Large

(NLP). The analysis centers on FinMA, a model created within the PIXIU
framework, which is evaluated for its performance in specialized financial

adaptation in financial applications, this study examines FinMA's model
architecture, its instruction tuning process utilizing the Financial

Findings indicate that FinMA performs well in sentiment analysis and
classification, but faces notable challenges in tasks involving numerical
reasoning, entity recognition, and summarization. This work aims to advance the
understanding of how financial LLMs can be effectively designed and evaluated
to assist in finance-related decision-making processes.

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，在大型语言模型评估中，用于分隔示例的标点符号选择会显著影响模型性能，性能差异可达±23%，甚至可以通过改变分隔符来操纵模型排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注示例数量，但示例格式选择（如分隔符）对模型性能的影响尚未得到充分研究，而用户在真实使用中经常面临如何分隔示例的决策。

Method: 通过测试不同分隔符（逗号、换行、分号、井号等）对多个主流模型家族（Llama、Qwen、Gemma）在MMLU等任务上的影响，并分析注意力头得分来理解机制。

Result: 分隔符选择导致模型性能波动高达±23%，可以仅通过改变单个分隔符字符来操纵模型排名，且这种脆弱性在不同主题和模型家族中普遍存在，不随模型规模改善。

Conclusion: 好的分隔符能引导注意力到关键标记，在提示中明确指定所选分隔符可提高鲁棒性，论文提供了最佳分隔符选择的实用建议。

Abstract: Common Large Language model (LLM) evaluations rely on demonstration examples
to steer models' responses to the desired style. While the number of examples
used has been studied and standardized, the choice of how to format examples is
less investigated. In evaluation protocols and real world usage, users face the
choice how to separate in-context examples: use a comma? new line? semi-colon?
hashtag? etc.? Surprisingly, we find this seemingly minor choice can
dramatically alter model response quality. Across leading model families
(Llama, Qwen, Gemma), performance on MMLU for example can vary by $\pm 23\%$
depending on the choice of delimiter. In fact, one can manipulate model
rankings to put any model in the lead by only modifying the single character
separating examples. We find LLMs' brittleness pervades topics, model families,
and doesn't improve with scale. By probing attention head scores, we find that
good-performing delimiters steer attention towards key tokens in the input.
Finally, we explore methods to improve LLMs' robustness to the choice of
delimiter. We find specifying the selected delimiter in the prompt boosts
robustness and offer practical recommendations for the best-performing
delimiters to select.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模公共讨论产生大量自由形式贡献，需要生成代表性且中立的摘要供政策使用。LLM虽然是有前景的工具，但存在少数观点代表性不足和输入顺序偏见等公平性问题，需要大规模评估方法。

Method: 创建DeliberationBank数据集，包含3000名参与者对10个讨论问题的意见数据，以及4500名参与者在四个维度上的摘要评判数据。基于此训练DeliberationJudge模型，使用微调的DeBERTa模型从个体角度评估讨论摘要。

Result: DeliberationJudge比多种LLM评判者更高效且与人类判断更一致。评估18个LLM发现讨论摘要存在持续弱点，特别是少数立场的代表性不足。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可扩展且可靠的方法来评估讨论摘要，有助于确保AI系统在政策制定中更具代表性和公平性。

Abstract: Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form
contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral
summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to
generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk
underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the
input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and
fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet
current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with
human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale
human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation
questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated
by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness,
informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train
DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation
summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and
more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With
DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in
deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority
positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate
deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative
and equitable for policymaking.

Method: 通过提示工程系统生成各类幻觉，构建专用数据集，使用嵌入模型映射到向量空间，通过无监督学习和降维分析幻觉与真实回答的空间分布。

Result: 定量评估显示幻觉的信息扭曲程度与其与正确输出簇的空间距离呈正相关，简单分类算法即可可靠区分幻觉与准确回答。

Conclusion: 该方法为改进LLM可靠性提供了一个轻量级但有效的框架，证明了在单个LLM内可靠检测幻觉的可行性。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology for the automatic detection of
hallucinations generated during large language model (LLM) inference. The
proposed approach is based on a systematic taxonomy and controlled reproduction
of diverse hallucination types through prompt engineering. A dedicated
hallucination dataset is subsequently mapped into a vector space using an
embedding model and analyzed with unsupervised learning techniques in a
reduced-dimensional representation of hallucinations with veridical responses.
Quantitative evaluation of inter-centroid distances reveals a consistent
correlation between the severity of informational distortion in hallucinations
and their spatial divergence from the cluster of correct outputs. These
findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that even simple
classification algorithms can reliably distinguish hallucinations from accurate
responses within a single LLM, thereby offering a lightweight yet effective
framework for improving model reliability.

### [29] [Let it Calm: Exploratory Annealed Decoding for Verifiable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05251)
*Chenghao Yang,Lin Gui,Chenxiao Yang,Victor Veitch,Lizhu Zhang,Zhuokai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为探索性退火解码（EAD）的新策略，通过从高到低动态调整采样温度来实现"开头探索、结尾利用"的生成策略，显著提升了强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）中语言模型的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准固定温度采样难以平衡探索与利用的权衡：高温会降低样本质量，低温则限制发现能力。需要一种既能保持样本质量又能确保训练稳定性的探索策略。

Method: EAD采用动态温度调度，在生成过程中从高温逐渐降低到低温。早期使用高温鼓励语义层面的多样性探索，后期使用低温保持样本质量并接近目标策略分布。

Result: EAD作为轻量级即插即用方法，在各种RLVR算法和模型规模下都显著优于固定温度采样，提高了样本效率。

Conclusion: 将探索策略与序列生成的自然动态对齐是提升语言模型推理能力的有效途径，EAD为此提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet
its success hinges on effective exploration. An ideal exploration strategy must
navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also
ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is
simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures
degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we
propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding
(EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early
tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an
intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by
annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This
dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then
gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the
sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable
training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that
significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming
fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our
work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential
generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Camellia是一个用于评估多语言大模型在亚洲语言中文化偏见的基准，涵盖9种亚洲语言和6种亚洲文化，包含19,530个手动标注的文化关联实体和2,173个自然语境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏多语言基准，目前不清楚大模型是否在不同非西方语言中表现出文化偏见。先前研究表明在阿拉伯语中LLMs偏向西方关联实体，引发文化公平性担忧。

Method: 构建Camellia基准，包含文化关联标注的实体和自然语境，评估四种多语言LLM家族在文化语境适应、情感关联和实体抽取QA等任务中的表现。

Result: LLMs在所有亚洲语言中都难以进行文化适应，性能因模型开发地区对文化相关数据的访问程度而异。不同LLM家族持有独特偏见，在情感与文化关联上表现不同。LLMs在亚洲语言上下文理解上存在困难，导致实体抽取中的文化性能差距。

Conclusion: 多语言大模型在亚洲语言中存在显著的文化偏见问题，需要更多文化相关数据和改进的上下文理解能力来解决这些公平性问题。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain stronger multilingual capabilities,
their ability to handle culturally diverse entities becomes crucial. Prior work
has shown that LLMs often favor Western-associated entities in Arabic, raising
concerns about cultural fairness. Due to the lack of multilingual benchmarks,
it remains unclear if such biases also manifest in different non-Western
languages. In this paper, we introduce Camellia, a benchmark for measuring
entity-centric cultural biases in nine Asian languages spanning six distinct
Asian cultures. Camellia includes 19,530 entities manually annotated for
association with the specific Asian or Western culture, as well as 2,173
naturally occurring masked contexts for entities derived from social media
posts. Using Camellia, we evaluate cultural biases in four recent multilingual
LLM families across various tasks such as cultural context adaptation,
sentiment association, and entity extractive QA. Our analyses show a struggle
by LLMs at cultural adaptation in all Asian languages, with performance
differing across models developed in regions with varying access to
culturally-relevant data. We further observe that different LLM families hold
their distinct biases, differing in how they associate cultures with particular
sentiments. Lastly, we find that LLMs struggle with context understanding in
Asian languages, creating performance gaps between cultures in entity
extraction.

*Yining She,Daniel W. Peterson,Marianne Menglin Liu,Vikas Upadhyay,Mohammad Hossein Chaghazardi,Eunsuk Kang,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based guardrail models are vulnerable to data distribution shifts, particularly when benign documents are inserted into the context, altering their judgments in 11% (input) and 8% (output) of cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，确保LLM系统的安全性成为迫切需求。基于LLM的外部护栏模型虽然流行，但它们本身也是微调或提示工程的LLM，容易受到数据分布变化的影响。

Method: 以检索增强生成(RAG)为案例研究，系统评估了3个Llama Guard和2个GPT-oss模型，分析在护栏上下文中插入良性文档的影响，并分别评估了检索文档、用户查询和LLM生成响应等组件的作用。

Result: 插入良性文档会改变输入和输出护栏的判断，分别影响约11%和8%的情况。测试的两种缓解方法仅带来轻微改进。

Conclusion: 当前护栏存在上下文鲁棒性差距，需要开发对检索和查询组合具有鲁棒性的训练和评估协议。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the
safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based
guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and
outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are
vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval
Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust
LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the
context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss
models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context
alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of
cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each
component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and
LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor
improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current
guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to
retrieval and query composition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了WeatherArchive-Bench基准，用于评估历史天气档案上的检索增强生成系统，包含检索和评估两个任务，揭示了现有方法在处理历史术语和复杂社会指标方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史天气档案包含丰富的社会应对极端天气的定性记录，但这些记录规模庞大、质量嘈杂且语言古老，难以转化为结构化知识用于气候研究。

Method: 构建WeatherArchive-Bench基准，包含WeatherArchive-Retrieval（从百万档案新闻片段中检索相关段落）和WeatherArchive-Assessment（评估LLM对社会脆弱性和韧性指标的分类能力）两个任务。

Result: 实验表明，密集检索器在处理历史术语时经常失败，而LLM经常误解脆弱性和韧性概念，揭示了在推理复杂社会指标方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计更稳健的气候导向RAG系统提供了见解，构建的数据集和评估框架已公开可用。

Abstract: Historical archives on weather events are collections of enduring primary
source records that offer rich, untapped narratives of how societies have
experienced and responded to extreme weather events. These qualitative accounts
provide insights into societal vulnerability and resilience that are largely
absent from meteorological records, making them valuable for climate scientists
to understand societal responses. However, their vast scale, noisy digitized
quality, and archaic language make it difficult to transform them into
structured knowledge for climate research. To address this challenge, we
introduce WeatherArchive-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on historical weather archives.
WeatherArchive-Bench comprises two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval, which
measures a system's ability to locate historically relevant passages from over
one million archival news segments, and WeatherArchive-Assessment, which
evaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can classify societal
vulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives.
Extensive experiments across sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers, as well
as a diverse set of LLMs, reveal that dense retrievers often fail on historical
terminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience
concepts. These findings highlight key limitations in reasoning about complex
societal indicators and provide insights for designing more robust
climate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts. The constructed dataset and
evaluation framework are publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/WeatherArchive-Bench/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Residualized Similarity (RS)的新方法，通过结合可解释特征系统和神经网络来提高作者验证性能，同时保持可解释性。该方法使用神经网络预测可解释系统的相似性残差，在四个数据集上达到了最先进模型的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者验证系统需要高准确性和可解释性，特别是在具有现实世界后果的决策中。神经网络方法虽然准确率高，但缺乏直接可解释性，且LLM预测无法忠实解释。需要一种既能提高性能又能保持可解释性的解决方案。

Method: 提出了Residualized Similarity (RS)方法，将可解释特征系统与神经网络相结合。核心思想是使用神经网络预测可解释系统产生的相似性残差（误差），从而在保持可解释性的同时提升性能。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估表明，该方法不仅能达到最先进作者验证模型的性能水平，还能展示最终预测的忠实性和可解释程度。

Conclusion: Residualized Similarity方法成功地在保持可解释性的前提下提升了作者验证系统的性能，为需要高准确性和可解释性的实际应用场景提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Responsible use of Authorship Verification (AV) systems not only requires
high accuracy but also interpretable solutions. More importantly, for systems
to be used to make decisions with real-world consequences requires the model's
prediction to be explainable using interpretable features that can be traced to
the original texts. Neural methods achieve high accuracies, but their
representations lack direct interpretability. Furthermore, LLM predictions
cannot be explained faithfully -- if there is an explanation given for a
prediction, it doesn't represent the reasoning process behind the model's
prediction. In this paper, we introduce Residualized Similarity (RS), a novel
method that supplements systems using interpretable features with a neural
network to improve their performance while maintaining interpretability.
Authorship verification is fundamentally a similarity task, where the goal is
to measure how alike two documents are. The key idea is to use the neural
network to predict a similarity residual, i.e. the error in the similarity
predicted by the interpretable system. Our evaluation across four datasets
shows that not only can we match the performance of state-of-the-art authorship
verification models, but we can show how and to what degree the final
prediction is faithful and interpretable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力机制的二次复杂度在处理长上下文时成为显著瓶颈，需要寻找更高效的替代方案。

Method: 对亚二次注意力变体、循环神经网络、状态空间模型和混合架构等不同方法进行系统性调查和批判性分析。

Result: 分析了各种方法在计算和内存复杂度、基准测试结果方面的表现，识别了它们的基本局限性。

Conclusion: 评估了这些新兴方法是否能够挑战纯注意力Transformer在序列处理任务中的主导地位。

Abstract: Transformers have dominated sequence processing tasks for the past seven
years -- most notably language modeling. However, the inherent quadratic
complexity of their attention mechanism remains a significant bottleneck as
context length increases. This paper surveys recent efforts to overcome this
bottleneck, including advances in (sub-quadratic) attention variants, recurrent
neural networks, state space models, and hybrid architectures. We critically
analyze these approaches in terms of compute and memory complexity, benchmark
results, and fundamental limitations to assess whether the dominance of
pure-attention transformers may soon be challenged.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现即使大语言模型能完美检索相关信息，随着输入长度增加（即使在其声称支持的上下文长度内），模型性能仍会显著下降13.9%-85%，这揭示了输入长度本身会损害LLM性能的先前未意识到的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么大语言模型在长上下文任务中的性能无法与其支持的上下文长度成比例扩展，特别是验证即使检索完美，模型性能是否仍会因输入长度而下降。

Method: 在数学、问答和编程任务上对5个开源和闭源LLM进行系统实验，包括将无关标记替换为空白、强制模型仅关注相关标记，以及将相关证据直接放在问题前等方法。

Result: 实验显示即使模型能完美检索所有相关信息，随着输入长度增加，性能仍会显著下降13.9%-85%，这种下降在无关标记被替换为空白或强制仅关注相关标记时仍然存在。

Conclusion: 输入长度本身会损害LLM性能，与检索质量和干扰无关。提出了简单的缓解策略：通过提示模型在解决问题前复述检索到的证据，将长上下文任务转化为短上下文任务，在RULER上观察到GPT-4o性能提升达4%。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to scale their performance on
long-context tasks performance in line with the context lengths they support.
This gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability
to identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent
efforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if
retrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a
long input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents
findings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic
experiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,
and coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all
relevant information, their performance still degrades substantially
(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'
claimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are
replaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when
they are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant
tokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is
placed immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a
previously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt
LLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.
They motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a
long-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the
retrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem. On RULER, we observe
a consistent improvement of GPT-4o up to 4% on an already strong baseline.

TL;DR: 提出跨语言患者压力表达图(CL-PDE)框架，通过图方法构建跨语言心理健康本体，解决印度心理健康沟通中的语言碎片化和文化多样性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度心理健康沟通存在语言碎片化、文化多样性，且在当前临床NLP中代表性不足。现有健康本体和心理健康资源以英语或西方文化为中心，无法充分代表印度语言中的患者痛苦表达。

Method: 使用基于图的方法构建跨语言心理健康本体，捕捉文化嵌入的痛苦表达，跨语言对齐，并与临床术语链接。

Result: 提出了CL-PDE框架，能够更好地表示文化有效的患者痛苦表达，为多语言环境中的心理健康护理提供更包容和以患者为中心的NLP工具。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将AI系统基于文化有效的表示，解决了医疗沟通中的关键差距，为多语言心理健康护理提供了更包容的解决方案。

Abstract: Mental health communication in India is linguistically fragmented, culturally
diverse, and often underrepresented in clinical NLP. Current health ontologies
and mental health resources are dominated by diagnostic frameworks centered on
English or Western culture, leaving a gap in representing patient distress
expressions in Indian languages. We propose cross-linguistic graphs of patient
stress expressions (CL-PDE), a framework for building cross-lingual mental
health ontologies through graph-based methods that capture culturally embedded
expressions of distress, align them across languages, and link them with
clinical terminology. Our approach addresses critical gaps in healthcare
communication by grounding AI systems in culturally valid representations,
allowing more inclusive and patient-centric NLP tools for mental health care in
multilingual contexts.

Motivation: ICU护理文档存在术语不一致、风格不规范、缺乏标准化等问题，在心衰护理中尤为关键，需要提高文档质量。

Method: 应用直接偏好优化(DPO)方法，使用MIMIC-III数据库中的8,838份心衰护理记录和21,210个偏好对，对Mistral-7B模型进行微调。

Result: BLEU从0.173提升至0.318(+84%)，BERTScore从0.828提升至0.891(+7.6%)，专家评分在准确性、完整性、逻辑一致性、可读性和结构清晰度方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: DPO能够使轻量级临床语言模型符合专家标准，支持隐私保护的AI辅助文档记录，减轻管理负担并提高ICU患者安全。

Abstract: Nursing documentation in intensive care units (ICUs) provides essential
clinical intelligence but often suffers from inconsistent terminology, informal
styles, and lack of standardization, challenges that are particularly critical
in heart failure care. This study applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
to adapt Mistral-7B, a locally deployable language model, using 8,838 heart
failure nursing notes from the MIMIC-III database and 21,210 preference pairs
derived from expert-verified GPT outputs, model generations, and original
notes. Evaluation across BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Perplexity, and expert
qualitative assessments demonstrates that DPO markedly enhances documentation
quality. Specifically, BLEU increased by 84% (0.173 to 0.318), BERTScore
improved by 7.6% (0.828 to 0.891), and expert ratings rose across accuracy
(+14.4 points), completeness (+14.5 points), logical consistency (+14.1
points), readability (+11.1 points), and structural clarity (+6.0 points).
These results indicate that DPO can align lightweight clinical language models
with expert standards, supporting privacy-preserving, AI-assisted documentation
within electronic health record systems to reduce administrative burden and
improve ICU patient safety.

Result: 在20个基准问题的实验中，系统在10次重复试验中大多数情况下准确率超过80%，优于Gemini-2.5 Pro和ChatGPT-4o模型。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的多智能体系统能够有效自动化2D框架的有限元建模，展示了LLM在结构工程领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used to empower autonomous
agents in engineering, significantly improving automation and efficiency in
labor-intensive workflows. However, their potential remains underexplored in
structural engineering, particularly for finite element modeling tasks
requiring geometric modeling, complex reasoning, and domain knowledge. To
bridge this gap, this paper develops a LLM-based multi-agent system to automate
finite element modeling of 2D frames. The system decomposes structural analysis
into subtasks, each managed by a specialized agent powered by the lightweight
Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. The workflow begins with a Problem Analysis
Agent, which extracts geometry, boundary, and material parameters from the user
input. Next, a Geometry Agent incrementally derives node coordinates and
element connectivity by applying expert-defined rules. These structured outputs
are converted into executable OpenSeesPy code by a Translation Agent and
refined by a Model Validation Agent through consistency checks. Then, a Load
Agent applies load conditions into the assembled structural model. Experimental
evaluations on 20 benchmark problems demonstrate that the system achieves
accuracy over 80% in most cases across 10 repeated trials, outperforming
Gemini-2.5 Pro and ChatGPT-4o models.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Filtered Distillation框架，通过三个无监督信任指标（自一致性、类别蕴含对齐、LLM一致性评分）来筛选LLM生成的专利分类理由，避免直接使用有噪声的推理作为监督信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的自然语言推理常包含逻辑错误、标签不匹配和领域特定偏差，直接用作监督会传播噪声并破坏训练稳定性。

Method: 使用三个信任指标构建统一信任分数：自一致性（多代稳定性）、类别蕴含对齐（与专利类别定义的语义一致性）、LLM一致性评分（理由-标签合理性验证），基于信任分数加权训练样本并可选过滤低信任案例。

Result: 在USPTO-2M数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、稳定性和可解释性方面优于基于标签的学习和传统蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 建立了一个利用推理感知信任指标的可靠范式，为专利分析提供了有效的监督学习框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language
rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors,
label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such
rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training
stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation,
a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats
LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision.
The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust
metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated
rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which
assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM
Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics
are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training
samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling
reasoning-aware supervision. Experiments on the USPTO-2M dataset, a widely used
benchmark for patent classification, show that our method outperforms
label-based learning and conventional distillation in accuracy, stability, and
interpretability, establishing a reliable paradigm for leveraging
reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.

Motivation: 由于人工评估成本高、耗时长且难以复现，需要研究LLM模拟用户是否能够可靠地替代真实用户进行多轮对话评估。

Method: 构建包含909个标注对话的SimulatorArena基准，在数学辅导和文档创建两个交互任务上评估各种模拟器方法，重点关注模拟器消息与人类行为的匹配度及其助手评分与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 基于用户画像的模拟器与人类判断高度一致，在两个任务上的Spearman相关系数均达到0.7，可作为实用、可扩展的人工评估替代方案。

Conclusion: 条件化用户画像的模拟器能够有效替代人工评估，使用最佳模拟器对18个助手进行了基准测试，包括GPT-5、Claude 4.1 Opus和Gemini 2.5 Pro等最新LLM。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in interactive
applications, and human evaluation remains the gold standard for assessing
their performance in multi-turn conversations. Since human studies are costly,
time-consuming, and hard to reproduce, recent work explores using LLMs to
simulate users for automatic assistant evaluation. However, there is no
benchmark or systematic study to evaluate whether these simulated users are
reliable stand-ins for real users. To address this, we introduce
SimulatorArena, a benchmark of 909 annotated human-LLM conversations on two
interactive tasks -- math tutoring and document creation. SimulatorArena
evaluates simulators based on how closely their messages match human behavior
and how well their assistant ratings align with human judgments. Experiments on
various simulator methods show that simulators conditioned on user profiles,
capturing traits like background and message styles, align closely with human
judgments. They reach Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.7 on both tasks, providing a
practical, scalable alternative to human evaluation. Using the best simulator
for each task, we benchmark 18 assistants, including the latest LLMs such as
GPT-5, Claude 4.1 Opus, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Conclusion: 基于图谱监督的多智能体路由方法在问答任务中表现出有效性和鲁棒性，能够捕捉不同智能体的互补优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and agent-based frameworks have advanced
rapidly, enabling diverse applications. Yet, with the proliferation of models
and agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting
the best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different
agents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models
are not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms.
Existing approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency
while overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent
in QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that
formulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem
supervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA
instance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual
entities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN)
to propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing
distributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted
aggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration
schemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
single-agent and ensemble baselines, while generalizing across benchmarks and
LLM backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of
graph-supervised multi-agent routing for question answering.

TL;DR: SoNLI是首个社交对话推理数据集，专注于讽刺和反讽等复杂社交细微差别，用于评估LLM和推理模型的心智理论能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言和推理模型难以理解对话数据中的复杂社交现象（如讽刺和反讽），需要评估其弱点并寻找解决方案。

Method: 构建SoNLI数据集，包含精心挑选的对话转录本、推理结果、可能性分数和人工编写的解释，通过多步反事实推理评估模型的心智理论能力。

Result: 该研究探索了社交推理分析作为心智理论的一个方面，并评估了LLM和推理模型的心智理论能力。

Conclusion: SoNLI数据集为评估和改进AI助手在复杂社交现象理解方面的能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Making theory-of-mind inferences from human dialogue is a strong indicator of
a model's underlying social abilities, which are fundamental for adept AI
assistants. However, large language and reasoning models struggle to understand
sophisticated social phenomena in transcript data, such as sarcasm and irony.
To assess the weaknesses of current models and to identify their solutions, we
introduce SocialNLI (SoNLI) -- the first social dialogue inference dataset.
SoNLI consists of a collection of dialogue transcripts hand-picked to center
complex social nuances like irony and sarcasm, paired with inferences,
corresponding likelihood scores, and human-written explanations. We explore
social inference analysis as a facet of theory-of-mind, and evaluate LLM and
reasoning model theory-of-mind ability through multi-step counterfactual
reasoning.

TL;DR: TensorBLEU是一个专为GPU优化的BLEU指标实现，针对训练中的逐句评估需求，相比传统CPU实现提供13-40倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代NLP模型规模巨大，但评估工具往往成为计算瓶颈，特别是在训练过程中需要高效计算逐句奖励信号时。

Method: 完全向量化的GPU加速实现，使用torch.unique创建紧凑的n-gram字典，避免传统哈希方法的内存开销。

Result: 在消费级GPU上提供13倍加速，在数据中心级GPU上提供超过40倍加速，将显著瓶颈转化为训练循环中的可忽略部分。

Conclusion: TensorBLEU为RL模型微调等研究领域提供了强大的加速工具，明确其作为开发用途的"Token-ID BLEU"定位。

Abstract: Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale,
yet the tools for their evaluation often remain a computational bottleneck,
limiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training
evaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement
Learning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on
the GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, a novel implementation of the
BLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our
approach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation
within PyTorch and introduces a memory-efficient counting mechanism. By
creating a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using
\texttt{torch.unique}, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of
traditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for
large-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard
library for token-ID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that
TensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and
exceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance
transforms a significant bottleneck into a negligible part of the training
loop. By clearly defining its role as a "Token-ID BLEU" for development
purposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide a powerful tool for
accelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过为规划基准添加细粒度自然语言约束，揭示了LLMs在规划任务中的局限性，发现约束使性能减半并挑战鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准仅包含通用简化环境规范，可能高估LLMs的规划能力并带来下游任务安全隐患，需要更丰富的约束评估。

Method: 在广泛使用的规划基准上手动标注细粒度自然语言约束，涵盖四个正式定义类别，评估4个SOTA推理LLM、3种形式语言、5种方法和4个数据集。

Result: 引入约束不仅使性能持续减半，还显著挑战了问题复杂性和词汇转移的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂约束下的规划能力存在显著局限，需要更全面的评估框架来确保实际应用中的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: LLMs have been widely used in planning, either as planners to generate action
sequences end-to-end, or as formalizers to represent the planning domain and
problem in a formal language that can derive plans deterministically. However,
both lines of work rely on standard benchmarks that only include generic and
simplistic environmental specifications, leading to potential overestimation of
the planning ability of LLMs and safety concerns in downstream tasks. We bridge
this gap by augmenting widely used planning benchmarks with manually annotated,
fine-grained, and rich natural language constraints spanning four formally
defined categories. Over 4 state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, 3 formal languages,
5 methods, and 4 datasets, we show that the introduction of constraints not
only consistently halves performance, but also significantly challenges
robustness to problem complexity and lexical shift.

Conclusion: LANTERN成功解决了在专业领域部署LLM的挑战，通过知识蒸馏框架实现了高质量、低延迟的职位匹配服务，并分享了后训练技术和提示工程的关键见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, deploying LLMs at scale
for domain specific applications, such as job-person fit and explanation in job
seeking platforms, introduces distinct challenges. At LinkedIn, the job person
fit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job
requirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.
Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to
yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and
the need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads
to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for
online use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM
knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit
tasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for
classification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better
distill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple
downstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that
integrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the
knowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training
techniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully
adapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics
for both job person fit and explanation. Online evaluations further confirm its
effectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement, including a
0.24\% increase in apply rate and a 0.28\% increase in qualified applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出原型动态引导(PDS)方法，无需指令即可增强大语言模型推理能力。通过聚类CoT和中性提示的激活差异构建推理原型，在推理时根据输入生成实例特定的引导向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM依赖显式推理指令或静态引导方法，缺乏自适应、无需指令的推理增强方法。

Method: 通过聚类CoT和中性提示的激活差异构建推理原型，在推理时将输入的隐藏状态投影到这些原型上形成实例特定的引导向量。

Result: 在GSM8K、AQuA-RAT和BIG-Bench任务上持续提升准确率，无需微调或提示工程。即使在抑制CoT以提升成本效益时，增益仍然存在。

Conclusion: 原型引导的动态转向是增强LLM推理的轻量级替代方案，能够加强潜在推理过程而非仅引起表面行为变化。

Abstract: Despite impressive breadth, LLMs still rely on explicit reasoning
instructions or static, one-fits-all steering methods, leaving a gap for
adaptive, instruction-free reasoning amplification. We present Prototype-Based
Dynamic Steering (PDS), a test-time method that amplifies large language model
(LLM) reasoning without adding or altering instructions. We introduce
"reasoning prototypes" by clustering activation differences between
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and neutral prompts. At inference, an input's hidden
state is projected onto these prototypes to form an instance-specific steering
vector. Evaluated on GSM8K, AQuA-RAT, and BIG-Bench tasks, PDS consistently
improves accuracy without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Notably, the gains
persist even when CoT is explicitly suppressed to improve cost-efficiency,
indicating that the intervention strengthens latent reasoning processes rather
than inducing a superficial behavioral shift. These results position dynamic,
prototype-guided steering as a lightweight alternative to training-time
approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出CAM（建构主义代理记忆）系统，基于皮亚杰建构主义理论设计，为LLM处理长文档提供结构化、灵活和动态的记忆模块，显著提升长文本阅读理解性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在理解长文档时面临信息过载问题，需要一种连贯的记忆模块来提升阅读能力。现有方法缺乏系统性设计原则。

Method: 受皮亚杰建构主义理论启发，设计具有结构化图式、灵活同化和动态适应三大特征的内存系统。核心采用增量重叠聚类算法支持结构化记忆发展，支持层次化摘要和在线批量集成。

Result: 在问答、查询摘要和声明验证等长文本阅读理解任务中，CAM在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 建构主义代理记忆为LLM长文档理解提供了有效的系统化解决方案，实现了结构化、灵活性和动态性的统一。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are confronted with overwhelming
information volume when comprehending long-form documents. This challenge
raises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla
LLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic
approaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we
draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three
traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and
dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust
and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end,
we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory
that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At
its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm
for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical
summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively
explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for
contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to
existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both
performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension
tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim
verification.

Motivation: 解决传统文本块RAG在安全关键领域知识提取中的局限性，提升全局推理能力和系统级洞察。

Method: 构建结构化知识图谱并集成到RAG流程中，使用OMIn数据集创建QA基准，评估多种本地可部署LLM。

Result: KEO显著改善全局感知能力，揭示模式和系统级洞察，而文本块RAG在需要局部检索的细粒度程序任务中保持有效。

Conclusion: 知识图谱增强的LLM在安全、领域特定的QA中具有前景，在高风险推理中潜力巨大。

Abstract: We present Knowledge Extraction on OMIn (KEO), a domain-specific knowledge
extraction and reasoning framework with large language models (LLMs) in
safety-critical contexts. Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence
(OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and
actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and
integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling
more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We
evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ
stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO
markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level
insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural
tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of
KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in
high-stakes reasoning.

TL;DR: H1B-KV是一种混合1位KV缓存压缩方案，通过1位二进制草图表示键向量和4位量化值向量，大幅减少内存使用，使7B参数LLM能在60MB缓存内处理8k上下文，性能与全精度相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码中KV缓存内存需求随上下文增长而增加，现有方法如缓存量化、令牌驱逐或仅键压缩方案存在不完整压缩或信息丢失问题。

Method: 采用混合压缩方案：键向量用1位二进制草图表示支持硬件友好的位运算注意力，值向量用4位量化，结合轻量级微调。

Result: 实现70倍内存减少，在困惑度基准和复杂下游任务（数学推理、多任务理解、代码生成）上匹配全精度性能，在质量-字节比上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: H1B-KV为内存受限环境中部署LLM提供了稳健解决方案，通过全面压缩方案在保持性能的同时大幅降低内存需求。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires caching a
growing list of past key-value (KV) pairs, making long-context inference a
memory-bound problem. While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache,
evicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these
approaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like
values) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper
introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression
scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV
represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling
hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using
4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter
LLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x
reduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches
full-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on
complex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task
understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV
significantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction
(SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte,
establishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自玩偏好优化已成为对齐大语言模型的重要范式，但提示作为核心组件的作用尚未充分探索。本文旨在研究不同难度提示如何影响自玩偏好优化过程。

Method: 使用提示的N个采样响应平均奖励作为难度代理指标，分析困难提示和简单提示在自玩优化中的表现差异，并探索缓解困难提示负面影响的策略。

Result: 困难提示的自玩优化性能显著低于简单提示；将困难提示加入训练不仅无法提升整体性能，反而会导致轻微性能下降；模型容量增大时，困难提示与简单提示的性能差距会缩小。

Conclusion: 选择性移除适当比例的困难提示可以提升整体自玩性能，提示难度与模型容量存在交互作用，需要根据模型能力调整训练数据难度。

Abstract: Self-play preference optimization has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs). It typically involves a language model
to generate on-policy responses for prompts and a reward model (RM) to guide
the selection of chosen and rejected responses, which can be further trained
with direct preference optimization (DPO). However, the role of prompts remains
underexplored, despite being a core component in this pipeline. In this work,
we investigate how prompts of varying difficulty influence self-play preference
optimization. We first use the mean reward of $N$ sampled responses of a prompt
as a proxy for its difficulty. We find that difficult prompts exhibit
substantially inferior self-play optimization performance in comparison to easy
prompts for language models. Moreover, incorporating difficult prompts into
training fails to enhance overall performance and, in fact, leads to slight
degradation compared to training on easy prompts alone. We also observe that
the performance gap between difficult and easy prompts closes as the model
capacity increases, suggesting that difficulty interacts with the model
capacity. Building on these findings, we explore strategies to mitigate the
negative effect of difficult prompts on final performance. We demonstrate that
selectively removing an appropriate portion of challenging prompts enhances
overall self-play performance, while also reporting failed attempts and lessons
learned.

Conclusion: PGSVD框架通过理论指导的秩选择，实现了高效的低秩压缩，为大型模型部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) and vision-language models (VLM) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance, but they impose significant memory and computing
challenges in deployment. We present a novel low-rank compression framework to
address this challenge. First, we upper bound the change of network loss via
layer-wise activation-based compression errors, filling a theoretical gap in
the literature. We then formulate low-rank model compression as a bi-objective
optimization and prove that a single uniform tolerance yields surrogate
Pareto-optimal heterogeneous ranks. Based on our theoretical insights, we
propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot
pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank
selection and alternating least-squares implementation. We apply PGSVD to both
LLM and VLM, showing better accuracy at the same compression levels and
inference speedup.

Conclusion: 多任务强化学习训练在美学感知任务中表现出更强的泛化能力，EvoPresent框架通过可靠的评估和反馈机制实现了有效的自我改进。

Abstract: The promotion of academic papers has become an important means of enhancing
research visibility. However, existing automated methods struggle limited
storytelling, insufficient aesthetic quality, and constrained self-adjustment,
making it difficult to achieve efficient and engaging dissemination. At the
heart of those challenges is a simple principle: \emph{there is no way to
improve it when you cannot evaluate it right}. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{EvoPresent}, a self-improvement agent framework that unifies coherent
narratives, aesthetic-aware designs, and realistic presentation delivery via
virtual characters. Central to EvoPresent is \textbf{PresAesth}, a multi-task
reinforcement learning (RL) aesthetic model that provides reliable aesthetic
scoring, defect adjustment, and comparative feedback, enabling iterative
self-improvement even under limited aesthetic training data. To systematically
evaluate the methods, we introduce \textbf{EvoPresent Benchmark}, a
comprehensive benchmark comprising: \textit{Presentation Generation Quality},
built on 650 top-tier AI conference papers with multimodal resources (slides,
videos and scripts) to assess both content and design; and \textit{Aesthetic
Awareness}, consisting of 2,000 slide pairs with varying aesthetic levels,
supporting joint training and evaluation on scoring, defect adjustment, and
comparison. Our findings highlight that (i) High-quality feedback is essential
for agent self-improvement, while initial capability alone does not guarantee
effective self-correction. (ii) Automated generation pipelines exhibit a
trade-off between visual design and content construction. (iii) Multi-task RL
training shows stronger generalization in aesthetic awareness tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements
in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with
handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due
to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose
Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework
tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive
strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning
tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem,
which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial
nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined
through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback,
which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning
strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node
generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and
concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic
strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning
process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental
results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset
and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and
7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance
language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: EAGLET提供了一个高效且有效的解决方案，无需人工努力或额外训练数据，显著提升了代理在长视野任务中的规划能力。

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) struggle with brainless
trial-and-error and generating hallucinatory actions due to a lack of global
planning in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we introduce a plan-and-execute
framework and propose EAGLET, an efficient and effective planner training
method to enhance the executor agent's planning abilities without human effort.
Specifically, we train a plug-and-play global planner through a two-step
process: we first synthesize high-quality plans from an advanced LLM using our
proposed homologous consensus filtering strategy, and apply fine-tuning as a
cold start. Moreover, we further improve the planner with a rule-based
reinforcement learning stage using a novel executor capability gain reward,
ensuring it can handle task instructions of varying difficulty. Experiments on
three long-horizon agent tasks show that executor agents equipped with our
planner outperform existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance. Meanwhile, EAGLET reduces training costs by 8x compared to
RL-based baselines, and it does not require manual effort or extra training
data, offering an efficient and effective solution.

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论策略能够解决单智能体方法的局限性，为多模态电子商务中的隐式AVE提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is essential for accurately
representing products in e-commerce, as it infers lantent attributes from
multimodal data. Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data
and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce
\textsc{\modelname}, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM
agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds,
agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference
performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate
that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for
attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various
debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and
analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight
the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of
single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in
multimodal e-commerce.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出代码转换上下文学习(CSICL)，通过在演示和指令中从目标语言逐步过渡到英语，为LLMs的英语潜在推理提供支持，克服多语言应用中的翻译障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言上下文学习方法主要使用单语演示，未能缓解反而强化了LLMs依赖英语作为潜在表示的翻译障碍，限制了LLM应用的包容性。

Method: CSICL是一种提示策略，在演示和指令中控制代码转换，从目标语言渐进过渡到英语，作为隐式语言桥梁增强跨语言对齐。

Result: 在4个LLM、6个数据集和10种语言的实验中，CSICL持续优于基线方法，在目标语言和未见语言上分别获得3.1%和1.9%的性能提升，在低资源设置下提升更显著(14.7%和5.3%)。

Conclusion: 代码转换是克服推理过程中翻译障碍的原则性和鲁棒方法，推动LLMs朝着更公平有效的多语言系统发展。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities,
their reliance on English as latent representations creates a translation
barrier, where reasoning implicitly depends on internal translation into
English. When this process fails, performance in non-English languages
deteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications.
Existing cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage
monolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead
reinforcing it. In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning
(CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively
transitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and
instruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. By explicitly
scaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts
as an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and
reduces reliance on the translation barrier. We conduct extensive experiments
across 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive
and reasoning-oriented domains. Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently
outperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target
and unseen languages, respectively. The improvement is even more pronounced in
low-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen
languages. These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust
approach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs
toward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.

Motivation: 现有基于结果监督强化学习的Agentic RAG方法存在探索效率低、奖励信号稀疏和全局奖励反馈模糊等问题，需要更有效的优化策略来提升复杂任务处理能力。

Method: 将RAG建模为马尔可夫决策过程，结合决策制定与执行机制，引入高效的剪枝策略来优化数据扩展，通过全面的过程级策略优化来提升模型能力。

Result: 在六个数据集上实现了平均6.2%的绝对性能提升，显著优于现有基线方法，同时剪枝策略使数据构建效率提升了近6倍。

Conclusion: DecEx-RAG为过程监督的RAG训练提供了高效解决方案，显著增强了LLM在复杂任务中的自主处理能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) enhances the processing
capability for complex tasks through dynamic retrieval and adaptive workflows.
Recent advances (e.g., Search-R1) have shown that outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning demonstrate strong performance. However, this approach
still suffers from inefficient exploration, sparse reward signals, and
ambiguous global reward feedback. To address these challenges, we propose
DecEx-RAG, which models RAG as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) incorporating
decision-making and execution, while introducing an efficient pruning strategy
to optimize data expansion. Through comprehensive process-level policy
optimization, DecEx-RAG significantly enhances the autonomous task
decomposition, dynamic retrieval, and high-quality answer generation
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Experiments show that DecEx-RAG
achieves an average absolute performance improvement of $6.2\%$ across six
datasets, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the pruning
strategy improves data construction efficiency by nearly $6 \times$, providing
an efficient solution for process-supervised RAG training. The code is

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成可信且符合FAIR原则的映射，将用于名称解析API和天文数据平台的集成。

Abstract: This ongoing work focuses on the development of a methodology for generating
a multi-source mapping of astronomical observation facilities. To compare two
entities, we compute scores with adaptable criteria and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques (Bag-of-Words approaches, sequential approaches,
and surface approaches) to map entities extracted from eight semantic
artifacts, including Wikidata and astronomy-oriented resources. We utilize
every property available, such as labels, definitions, descriptions, external
identifiers, and more domain-specific properties, such as the observation
wavebands, spacecraft launch dates, funding agencies, etc. Finally, we use a
Large Language Model (LLM) to accept or reject a mapping suggestion and provide
a justification, ensuring the plausibility and FAIRness of the validated
synonym pairs. The resulting mapping is composed of multi-source synonym sets
providing only one standardized label per entity. Those mappings will be used
to feed our Name Resolver API and will be integrated into the International
Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) Vocabularies and the OntoPortal-Astro

TL;DR: 本文通过推导非渐近谱带，建立了InfoNCE梯度范数与对齐度、温度和批次谱的关系，提出了基于有效秩的谱感知批次选择方法，在ImageNet和CIFAR-10上显著提升了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在批次选择上缺乏理论指导，导致训练效率低下。本文旨在通过理论分析InfoNCE梯度的谱特性，设计更有效的批次选择策略。

Method: 推导了非渐近谱带边界，使用有效秩作为各向异性代理指标，设计了谱感知批次选择方法（包括快速贪婪构建器），并引入批次内白化技术。

Result: 在ImageNet-100上，Greedy-64相比随机选择将达到67.5% top-1精度的时间减少了15%；批次内白化将50步梯度方差降低了1.37倍。

Conclusion: 谱感知批次选择能显著提升对比学习效率，批次内白化能有效促进各向同性并降低梯度方差，理论分析与实验结果一致。

Abstract: We derive non-asymptotic spectral bands that bound the squared InfoNCE
gradient norm via alignment, temperature, and batch spectrum, recovering the
\(1/\tau^{2}\) law and closely tracking batch-mean gradients on synthetic data
and ImageNet. Using effective rank \(R_{\mathrm{eff}}\) as an anisotropy proxy,
we design spectrum-aware batch selection, including a fast greedy builder. On
ImageNet-100, Greedy-64 cuts time-to-67.5\% top-1 by 15\% vs.\ random (24\%
vs.\ Pool--P3) at equal accuracy; CIFAR-10 shows similar gains. In-batch
whitening promotes isotropy and reduces 50-step gradient variance by
\(1.37\times\), matching our theoretical upper bound.

Motivation: 在大数据时代，需要将海量文本转化为简洁、连贯且信息丰富的摘要。尽管已有显著进展，但在信息丰富度方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 1. 基于最优运输的信息注意力方法，改进对参考摘要中关键信息的学习；2. 命名实体上的累积联合熵减少方法，增强信息显著性。

Result: 在CNN/Daily Mail数据集上获得了比先前工作更好的ROUGE分数，在XSum上具有竞争性结果。人工评估也显示该方法在信息丰富度方面优于强基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了抽象文本摘要的信息丰富度，进一步分析揭示了评估结果背后的合理原因。

Abstract: Abstractive text summarization is integral to the Big Data era, which demands
advanced methods to turn voluminous and often long text data into concise but
coherent and informative summaries for efficient human consumption. Despite
significant progress, there is still room for improvement in various aspects.
One such aspect is to improve informativeness. Hence, this paper proposes a
novel learning approach consisting of two methods: an optimal transport-based
informative attention method to improve learning focal information in reference
summaries and an accumulative joint entropy reduction method on named entities
to enhance informative salience. Experiment results show that our approach
achieves better ROUGE scores compared to prior work on CNN/Daily Mail while
having competitive results on XSum. Human evaluation of informativeness also
demonstrates the better performance of our approach over a strong baseline.
Further analysis gives insight into the plausible reasons underlying the
evaluation results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MoE模型在推理时的参数激活稀疏性，发现大多数神经元激活值接近零，这为选择高激活神经元专家提供了理论基础。

Method: 提出Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE)，在每个专家内部进行简单的top-k选择，仅激活高激活值的神经元，无需额外路由参数或专家间通信。

Result: MoNE在仅激活50%MoE层参数的情况下与传统MoE性能相当，在相同激活参数数量下持续优于传统MoE。

Conclusion: MoNE是提高MoE类模型参数利用率和推理效率的实用方法。

Abstract: In this work, we first explore whether the parameters activated by the MoE
layer remain highly sparse at inference. We perform a sparsification study on
several representative MoE models. For each expert, we rank parameters by the
magnitude of their activations from the gate projection and progressively prune
the activated subset. Pruning up to 60% of parameters within that subset causes
only negligible task-performance degradation; substantial drops occur only
after more than 90% are removed. We further decompose experts into
neuron-granular MoE and visualize their activation values, finding that most
neuron activations are near zero. This observation motivates us to select only
high-activation neuron experts during pretraining. Based on this insight, we
propose Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE). MoNE achieves neuron-granular expert
selection by only applying a simple top-k selection within each expert, incurs
negligible latency, and requires no additional routing parameters or
inter-expert communication. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE matches
traditional MoE performance while activating only 50% of the MoE-layer
parameters, and it consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at
equal numbers of activated parameters. These results suggest that MoNE is a
practical approach to improving parameter utilization and inference efficiency
in MoE-like models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于偏好优化的TTS系统需要utterance级别的配对样本，但这种配对数据在TTS输出中往往有限，且utterance级别的表述阻碍了实现准确发音对齐所需的细粒度token级优化。

Method: 提出TKTO方法，无需配对数据，直接针对token级单元进行优化，自动提供细粒度对齐信号而不需要token级标注。

Result: TKTO将具有挑战性的日语TTS准确率提高了39%，CER降低了54%，自动为目标token分配了12.8倍更强的奖励。

Conclusion: TKTO方法通过消除对配对数据的需求并实现token级优化，有效提高了TTS系统的准确性和自然度。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human feedback through
preference optimization has been shown to effectively improve the robustness
and naturalness of language model-based TTS models. Current approaches
primarily require paired desirable and undesirable samples at the utterance
level. However, such pairs are often limited in TTS output data, and
utterance-level formulation prevents fine-grained token-level optimization
needed for accurate pronunciation alignment. In this study, we propose TKTO
that eliminates the need for paired data, enabling a more data-efficient
training paradigm, and directly targets token-level units, automatically
providing fine-grained alignment signals without token-level annotations. TKTO
improves the challenging Japanese TTS accuracy by 39% and reduces CER by 54%,
automatically assigning 12.8 times stronger reward to targeted tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法过度强调利用，导致熵崩溃、探索能力下降和性能提升有限，需要解决探索-利用平衡问题。

Method: 使用两阶段rollout：第一阶段模型生成一半轨迹，然后通过轻量级unlearning步骤暂时抑制这些响应，迫使第二阶段探索输出空间的不同区域。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，EEPO优于GRPO，在Qwen2.5-3B、Llama3.2-3B-Instruct和Qwen3-8B-Base上分别实现了24.3%、33.0%和10.4%的平均相对增益。

Conclusion: EEPO通过样本-遗忘机制打破了自我强化循环，在RLVR中有效促进了更广泛的探索，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation remains a central challenge in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models
(LLMs). Current RLVR methods often overemphasize exploitation, leading to
entropy collapse, diminished exploratory capacity, and ultimately limited
performance gains. Although techniques that increase policy stochasticity can
promote exploration, they frequently fail to escape dominant behavioral modes.
This creates a self-reinforcing loop-repeatedly sampling and rewarding dominant
modes-that further erodes exploration. We introduce Exploration-Enhanced Policy
Optimization (EEPO), a framework that promotes exploration via two-stage
rollouts with adaptive unlearning. In the first stage, the model generates half
of the trajectories; it then undergoes a lightweight unlearning step to
temporarily suppress these sampled responses, forcing the second stage to
explore different regions of the output space. This sample-then-forget
mechanism disrupts the self-reinforcing loop and promotes wider exploration
during rollouts. Across five reasoning benchmarks, EEPO outperforms GRPO,
achieving average relative gains of 24.3% on Qwen2.5-3B, 33.0% on
Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, and 10.4% on Qwen3-8B-Base.

Abstract: The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains predominantly
English-centric, resulting in a significant performance gap for other major

in French compared to English, and research on efficient adaptation methods for
French remains limited. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Luth}, a family
of French-specialized SLMs: through targeted post-training on curated,
high-quality French data, our models outperform all open-source counterparts of
comparable size on multiple French benchmarks while retaining their original
English capabilities. We further show that strategic model merging enhances
performance in both languages, establishing Luth as a new state of the art for
French SLMs and a robust baseline for future French-language research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization, yet their performance often falls short when applied to
specialized domains %or conversational data that differ from their original
pre-training distribution. While fine-tuning can improve summarization quality,
it typically relies on costly and scarce high-quality labeled data. In this
work, we explore continual pre-training as a scalable, self-supervised approach
to adapt LLMs for downstream summarization tasks, particularly in the context
of noisy real-world conversation transcripts. We conduct extensive experiments
using large-scale, unlabeled business conversation data to investigate whether
continual pre-training enhances model capabilities in conversational
summarization. Our results demonstrate that continual pre-training yields
substantial gains in both in-domain and out-of-domain summarization benchmarks,
while maintaining strong generalization and robustness. We also analyze the
effects of data selection strategies, providing practical guidelines for
applying continual pre-training in summarization-focused industrial
applications.

Motivation: 企业面临日益复杂的数字法规合规挑战，特别是小型企业缺乏资源和专业知识来起草复杂的法律文件。虽然有自动化合同生成器服务，但缺乏对其普及程度和输出质量的实证证据。

Method: 创建并标注了一个多语言基准数据集，捕捉瑞士和欧盟隐私法下的关键合规义务。使用基于GPT-5的新方法进行大规模隐私政策合规评估，测量法律修订的影响。

Result: 观察到合规性增加，表明法律修订产生了效果。18%的本地网站明确使用了生成器，使用生成器的隐私政策合规水平显著更高，相比未使用生成器的政策合规率最高可提升15个百分点。

Conclusion: 这些发现对三个议题有贡献：LLM在跨语言法律分析中的潜力、欧盟法规的布鲁塞尔效应，以及自动化工具在提高合规性和合同质量方面的关键作用。

Abstract: It has become increasingly challenging for firms to comply with a plethora of
novel digital regulations. This is especially true for smaller businesses that
often lack both the resources and know-how to draft complex legal documents.
Instead of seeking costly legal advice from attorneys, firms may turn to
cheaper alternative legal service providers such as automated contract
generators. While these services have a long-standing presence, there is little
empirical evidence on their prevalence and output quality.
  We address this gap in the context of a 2023 Swiss privacy law revision. To
enable a systematic evaluation, we create and annotate a multilingual benchmark
dataset that captures key compliance obligations under Swiss and EU privacy
law. Using this dataset, we validate a novel GPT-5-based method for large-scale
compliance assessment of privacy policies, allowing us to measure the impact of
the revision. We observe compliance increases indicating an effect of the
revision. Generators, explicitly referenced by 18% of local websites, are
associated with substantially higher levels of compliance, with increases of up
to 15 percentage points compared to privacy policies without generator use.
These findings contribute to three debates: the potential of LLMs for
cross-lingual legal analysis, the Brussels Effect of EU regulations, and,
crucially, the role of automated tools in improving compliance and contractual
quality.

Motivation: 长上下文模型容易受到上下文噪声（无关标记）的影响，这会误导模型注意力，降低关键信息的利用效率

Method: 使用积分梯度（IG）分数检测和量化上下文噪声，并提出上下文去噪训练（CDT）策略，强化关键标记对模型预测的影响

Result: 在四个任务上的实验表明，CDT能显著提升模型性能，使用CDT训练的8B开源模型能达到与GPT-4o（51.00）相当的50.92分

Conclusion: 上下文去噪训练是一种简单有效的策略，能显著提升长上下文模型对关键信息的关注度和整体性能

Abstract: Long-context models (LCMs) have demonstrated great potential in processing
long sequences, facilitating many real-world applications. The success of LCMs
can be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information
within the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals
that LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens,
that can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained
analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated
Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the
context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context
noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and
benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context
Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy
that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on
model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context
window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority
of CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve
performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型越来越多地应用于依赖长上下文的场景，但其在安全关键场景下的行为尚不明确，需要系统评估模型对有害内容的敏感性。

Method: 通过改变有害内容的类型（显性vs隐性）、位置（开头、中间、结尾）、比例（0.01-0.50）和上下文长度（600-6000词元），在LLaMA-3、Qwen-2.5和Mistral等模型上评估对有毒、冒犯性和仇恨言论等有害内容的检测性能。

Result: 所有模型表现出相似模式：性能在中等有害内容比例（0.25）时达到峰值；随着上下文长度增加，召回率下降；开头位置的有害内容检测更可靠；显性内容比隐性内容识别更一致。

Conclusion: 这为理解大语言模型在长上下文中如何优先处理和校准有害内容提供了首个系统视角，既展示了其新兴优势，也指出了安全关键应用中仍面临的挑战。

While their long-context capabilities are well studied for reasoning and
retrieval, little is known about their behavior in safety-critical scenarios.
We evaluate LLMs' sensitivity to harmful content under extended context,
varying type (explicit vs. implicit), position (beginning, middle, end),
prevalence (0.01-0.50 of the prompt), and context length (600-6000 tokens).
Across harmful content categories such as toxic, offensive, and hate speech,
with LLaMA-3, Qwen-2.5, and Mistral, we observe similar patterns: performance
peaks at moderate harmful prevalence (0.25) but declines when content is very
sparse or dominant; recall decreases with increasing context length; harmful
sentences at the beginning are generally detected more reliably; and explicit
content is more consistently recognized than implicit. These findings provide
the first systematic view of how LLMs prioritize and calibrate harmful content
in long contexts, highlighting both their emerging strengths and the challenges
that remain for safety-critical use.

### [70] [The fragility of "cultural tendencies" in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05869)
*Kun Sun,Rong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对LSZ(2025)关于LLMs在不同语言提示下表现出文化特异性倾向的研究进行了批判性重评估，认为其报告的"文化倾向"是特定模型和任务设计的脆弱产物，而非稳定的文化特质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑LSZ关于LLMs在不同语言提示下表现出稳定文化倾向的结论，认为其方法、实验设计和解释存在问题，需要进行更严谨的验证。

Method: 使用更广泛的LLMs集合和更多测试项目进行针对性复制实验，重新评估提示语言对模型输出的影响。

Result: 发现提示语言对输出影响极小，挑战了LSZ关于这些模型编码了根深蒂固文化信念的主张。

Conclusion: LLMs在不同语言提示下表现出的所谓"文化倾向"并非稳定的文化特质，而是特定实验设置的脆弱产物。

Abstract: In a recent study, Lu, Song, and Zhang (2025) (LSZ) propose that large
language models (LLMs), when prompted in different languages, display
culturally specific tendencies. They report that the two models (i.e., GPT and
ERNIE) respond in more interdependent and holistic ways when prompted in
Chinese, and more independent and analytic ways when prompted in English. LSZ
attribute these differences to deep-seated cultural patterns in the models,
claiming that prompt language alone can induce substantial cultural shifts.
While we acknowledge the empirical patterns they observed, we find their
experiments, methods, and interpretations problematic. In this paper, we
critically re-evaluate the methodology, theoretical framing, and conclusions of
LSZ. We argue that the reported "cultural tendencies" are not stable traits but
fragile artifacts of specific models and task design. To test this, we
conducted targeted replications using a broader set of LLMs and a larger number
of test items. Our results show that prompt language has minimal effect on
outputs, challenging LSZ's claim that these models encode grounded cultural
beliefs.

TL;DR: 提出基于强化学习的提示优化框架，通过生成逐轮反馈和经验回放来优化LLM智能体的任务指令提示，显著提升多轮交互任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮交互中表现不佳，往往依赖错误的早期假设且无法跟踪用户目标，而对话系统中长期规划对处理交互任务至关重要。

Method: 受强化学习启发的提示优化框架，仅通过修改LLM智能体的任务指令提示来实现规划，利用逐轮反馈生成和经验回放进行提示重写。

Result: 在文本到SQL和任务导向对话等多轮任务中显示出显著改进，能够跨不同LLM智能体泛化，并可利用多样化LLM作为元提示智能体。

Conclusion: 该方法为无参数的强化学习启发优化方法开辟了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of natural language processing tasks and can be adapted through prompting.
However, they remain suboptimal in multi-turn interactions, often relying on
incorrect early assumptions and failing to track user goals over time, which
makes such tasks particularly challenging. Prior works in dialogue systems have
shown that long-term planning is essential for handling interactive tasks. In
this work, we propose a prompt optimisation framework inspired by reinforcement
learning, which enables such planning to take place by only modifying the task
instruction prompt of the LLM-based agent. By generating turn-by-turn feedback
and leveraging experience replay for prompt rewriting, our proposed method
shows significant improvement in multi-turn tasks such as text-to-SQL and
task-oriented dialogue. Moreover, it generalises across different LLM-based
agents and can leverage diverse LLMs as meta-prompting agents. This warrants
future research in reinforcement learning-inspired parameter-free optimisation
methods.

Motivation: 当前文化评估基准将文化简化为静态事实或同质价值观，这与人类学强调文化是动态的、历史情境化的和实践中的观点相冲突，需要更准确的文化评估方法。

Method: 引入四部分框架（知识、偏好、表现、偏见）来分类基准如何构建文化概念，定性分析20个文化基准，识别六个方法问题，并基于人类学方法提出具体改进方案。

Result: 识别了六个常见方法问题：将国家等同于文化、忽视文化内部多样性、依赖过度简化的调查格式等，并提出了包含真实叙事、社区参与、情境评估等改进措施。

Conclusion: 需要开发超越静态记忆任务的文化基准，更准确地捕捉模型在复杂文化情境中的响应，这需要结合人类学视角和方法来改进基准设计。

Abstract: Cultural evaluation of large language models has become increasingly
important, yet current benchmarks often reduce culture to static facts or
homogeneous values. This view conflicts with anthropological accounts that
emphasize culture as dynamic, historically situated, and enacted in practice.
To analyze this gap, we introduce a four-part framework that categorizes how
benchmarks frame culture, such as knowledge, preference, performance, or bias.
Using this lens, we qualitatively examine 20 cultural benchmarks and identify
six recurring methodological issues, including treating countries as cultures,
overlooking within-culture diversity, and relying on oversimplified survey
formats. Drawing on established anthropological methods, we propose concrete
improvements: incorporating real-world narratives and scenarios, involving
cultural communities in design and validation, and evaluating models in context
rather than isolation. Our aim is to guide the development of cultural
benchmarks that go beyond static recall tasks and more accurately capture the
responses of the models to complex cultural situations.

TL;DR: EvalMORAAL是一个透明的思维链框架，使用两种评分方法（对数概率和直接评分）加上模型作为评判者的同行评审，评估20个大语言模型的道德对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在不同文化背景下的道德对齐性，发现模型在西方和非西方地区存在明显差异，揭示区域偏见问题。

Method: 使用世界价值观调查（55个国家，19个主题）和皮尤全球态度调查（39个国家，8个主题），结合两种评分方法和模型作为评判者的同行评审机制。

Result: 顶级模型与调查响应高度一致（皮尔逊相关系数约0.90），但西方地区平均r=0.82，非西方地区平均r=0.61，存在0.21的绝对差距。同行评审识别出348个冲突。

Conclusion: 该框架在实现文化感知AI方面取得真正进展，但跨区域使用仍面临开放挑战，同行一致性有助于自动质量检查。

Abstract: We present EvalMORAAL, a transparent chain-of-thought (CoT) framework that
uses two scoring methods (log-probabilities and direct ratings) plus a
model-as-judge peer review to evaluate moral alignment in 20 large language
models. We assess models on the World Values Survey (55 countries, 19 topics)
and the PEW Global Attitudes Survey (39 countries, 8 topics). With EvalMORAAL,
top models align closely with survey responses (Pearson's r approximately 0.90
on WVS). Yet we find a clear regional difference: Western regions average
r=0.82 while non-Western regions average r=0.61 (a 0.21 absolute gap),
indicating consistent regional bias. Our framework adds three parts: (1) two
scoring methods for all models to enable fair comparison, (2) a structured
chain-of-thought protocol with self-consistency checks, and (3) a
model-as-judge peer review that flags 348 conflicts using a data-driven
threshold. Peer agreement relates to survey alignment (WVS r=0.74, PEW r=0.39,
both p<.001), supporting automated quality checks. These results show real
progress toward culture-aware AI while highlighting open challenges for use
across regions.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型能在内部表征中线性建模数学问题的难度，通过分析最终Transformer层的注意力头，揭示了难度感知的结构性组织，为自动难度标注提供了实用支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型是否能在内部表征中编码问题难度，这是自适应推理和高效资源分配的关键能力，目前对此了解甚少。

Method: 使用线性探针分析LLMs最终token的表征，定位最终Transformer层中具有相反激活模式的特定注意力头，通过消融实验验证定位准确性。

Result: 数学问题难度可以在LLMs内部表征中被线性建模，特定注意力头对简单和困难问题呈现相反激活模式，熵和难度感知在token层面存在显著差异。

Conclusion: LLMs中的难度感知不仅存在且具有结构性组织，为自动难度标注提供了实用支持，可大幅减少人工标注成本，为基准构建和课程学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on complex reasoning
tasks, yet little is known about their ability to internally evaluate problem
difficulty, which is an essential capability for adaptive reasoning and
efficient resource allocation. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations. Using a
linear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that
the difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further
locate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these
attention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult
problems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments
prove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide
practical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators,
potentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in
benchmark construction and curriculum learning. We also uncover that there is a
significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level.
Our study reveals that difficulty perception in LLMs is not only present but
also structurally organized, offering new theoretical insights and practical
directions for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LexiCon是一个基于自然语言的约束规划基准测试，用于评估LLM在有约束规划任务中的表现，特别是安全约束方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM规划评估主要关注无约束任务，但在现实世界中，遵守约束（特别是安全约束）至关重要，需要评估LLM在约束规划任务中的能力。

Method: 在现有规划环境中施加时间约束，将这些约束问题转化为自然语言描述，然后让LLM解决。LexiCon具有可扩展性，可以自动为新环境生成时间约束。

Result: 实验表明，包括GPT-5、o3和R1在内的最先进LLM，随着规划任务约束程度的增加，其性能会显著下降。

Conclusion: LLM在约束规划任务中的表现仍有待改进，LexiCon提供了一个可扩展的基准测试框架来系统评估LLM的约束规划能力。

Abstract: Owing to their reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have been
evaluated on planning tasks described in natural language. However, LLMs have
largely been tested on planning domains without constraints. In order to deploy
them in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular
safety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on
constrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based
(Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of
environments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in
a principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning
environments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained
problems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to
solve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of
supported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment
generators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This
renders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems
can be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve. Our experiments
reveal that the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning
models like GPT-5, o3, and R1, deteriorates as the degree of constrainedness of
the planning tasks increases.

Motivation: 先前研究使用不同评估方法对大型语言模型学习复杂句法的能力得出了矛盾的结论，本文旨在澄清这些分歧，证明评估方法的选择对判断模型句法能力至关重要。

Method: 生成完整的8种排列范式寄生空位刺激材料，使用Wilcox风格的最小对比较方法（wh效应）系统评估GPT-2模型。

Result: GPT-2在所有四个测试条件下都成功，表明即使在复杂的寄生空位环境中，模型也具有对填充语-空位许可原则的稳健知识。

Conclusion: 直接最小对比较方法比差分方法提供更清晰的诊断透明度，评估指标的选择对准确评估语言模型的句法能力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent studies probing the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS)
have applied Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the learnability of complex
syntax through surprisal-based metrics. However, divergent conclusions raise
questions concerning the insights these metrics offer. While Wilcox et al.
(2024) used direct minimal pair comparisons (the "wh-effect") to demonstrate
that models successfully generalise knowledge of filler-gap dependencies, Lan
et al. (2024) used a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) metric and found that
models largely fail on parasitic gaps (PGs). This paper argues that the direct
minimal pair approach offers greater diagnostic transparency. We demonstrate
this by generating a full 8-permutation paradigm of refined PG stimuli and
evaluating the GPT-2 model used in previous studies with a systematic
Wilcox-style wh-effect analysis. Our results show that GPT-2 succeeds across
all four tested conditions, indicating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing
principles even in complex PG environments. This finding, which contrasts with
the more ambiguous results from DiD-style metrics, suggests that the choice of
evaluation metric is critical for assessing an LLM's syntactic competence.

TL;DR: MASA提出了一种多A单B的LoRA改进架构，通过多专家A矩阵捕获多样化特征，解决了传统LoRA单一下投影矩阵的特征表示瓶颈问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA依赖单一的下投影矩阵A，这形成了表示瓶颈，无法捕捉复杂任务所需的多样化信号，因此需要丰富特征适应能力来提升下游任务适应能力

Method: 采用多A单B结构，其中多专家A矩阵在层间非对称共享以确保参数效率，这些专门化专家捕获多样化特征，然后由层特定的单一B矩阵进行整合

Result: 在MMLU基准测试中，MASA平均准确率达到59.62%，比标准LoRA提升1.08个百分点（相对提升1.84%），可学习参数为0.52%

Conclusion: MASA通过多专家A矩阵的架构设计有效提升了特征表示能力，在保持参数效率的同时显著改善了模型在下游任务上的性能

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant method in
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for large language models, which
augments the transformer layer with one down-projection $A$ and one
up-projection $B$. However, LoRA's reliance on a single down-projection matrix
($A$) creates a representational bottleneck, as this solitary feature extractor
is inherently insufficient for capturing the diverse signals required by
complex tasks. This motivates our architectural shift to focus on enriching the
feature adaptation to improve the downstream task adaptation ability. We
propose MASA (Multi-$A$ Shared Adaptation), an architecture that implements a
multi-$A$, single-$B$ structure where the multi-$A$ expert ensemble is
asymmetrically shared across layers to ensure parameter efficiency. In MASA,
these specialized experts capture diverse features, which are then integrated
by a single, layer-specific $B$-matrix. The effectiveness and versatility of
our method are validated through a comprehensive suite of experiments spanning
multi-domain generalization, single-domain specialization, and multi-task
reasoning. For example, on the MMLU benchmark, MASA achieves an average
accuracy of 59.62%, outperforming the standard LoRA by 1.08 points (a relative
improvement of 1.84%) with comparable learnable parameters of 0.52%.

Motivation: 近期使用大语言模型测试刺激贫乏论证的研究在不同句法现象上得出矛盾结果，本文假设刺激物的词汇歧义和结构复杂性可能混淆模型表现。

Method: 提出重新评估LLM句法能力的方法：1）在先前使用的刺激物上建立基线；2）使用先进的生成式LLM（Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview）基于语言学模板生成新的精炼数据集，以减轻已识别的混淆因素。

Result: 初步发现表明，GPT-2在精炼的PG刺激物上表现出显著优于基线的性能。

Conclusion: 刺激物质量显著影响基于惊讶度的LLM句法能力评估结果。

Abstract: Recent studies employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the Argument
from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS) have yielded contrasting results across
syntactic phenomena. This paper investigates the hypothesis that
characteristics of the stimuli used in recent studies, including lexical
ambiguities and structural complexities, may confound model performance. A
methodology is proposed for re-evaluating LLM competence on syntactic
prediction, focusing on GPT-2. This involves: 1) establishing a baseline on
previously used (both filtered and unfiltered) stimuli, and 2) generating a
new, refined dataset using a state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative LLM (Gemini 2.5
Pro Preview) guided by linguistically-informed templates designed to mitigate
identified confounds. Our preliminary findings indicate that GPT-2 demonstrates
notably improved performance on these refined PG stimuli compared to baselines,
suggesting that stimulus quality significantly influences outcomes in
surprisal-based evaluations of LLM syntactic competency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, Chinese LLMs face unique
challenges, primarily due to the dominance of unstructured free text and the
lack of structured representations in Chinese corpora. While existing
benchmarks for LLMs partially assess Chinese LLMs, they are still predominantly
English-centric and fail to address the unique linguistic characteristics of
Chinese, lacking structured datasets essential for robust evaluation. To
address these challenges, we present a Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating
Chinese Large Language Models (CB-ECLLM) based on the newly constructed Chinese
Data-Text Pair (CDTP) dataset. Specifically, CDTP comprises over 7 million
aligned text pairs, each consisting of unstructured text coupled with one or
more corresponding triples, alongside a total of 15 million triples spanning
four critical domains. The core contributions of CDTP are threefold: (i)
enriching Chinese corpora with high-quality structured information; (ii)
enabling fine-grained evaluation tailored to knowledge-driven tasks; and (iii)
supporting multi-task fine-tuning to assess generalization and robustness
across scenarios, including Knowledge Graph Completion, Triple-to-Text
generation, and Question Answering. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous
evaluations through extensive experiments and ablation studies to assess the
effectiveness, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and robustness of the benchmark.
To support reproducible research, we offer an open-source codebase and outline
potential directions for future investigations based on our insights.

Motivation: 发现当前LLM后训练方法中基于结果监督的强化学习存在根本缺陷：正优势token的重要性采样比率不匹配，导致正负token权重不平衡，抑制了低概率token的更新而过度放大了高概率token。

Method: 提出非对称重要性采样策略优化(ASPO)，采用简单有效的策略翻转正优势token的IS比率，使其更新方向与负token保持一致，并引入软双重裁剪机制来稳定极端更新同时保持梯度流动。

Result: 在编程和数学推理基准测试上的综合实验表明，ASPO显著缓解了过早收敛问题，提高了训练稳定性，并在基于GRPO的强基线上增强了最终性能。

Conclusion: 分析为token级权重在OSRL中的作用提供了新见解，强调了在LLM强化学习中修正IS的至关重要性。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM) post-training methods rely on token-level
clipping mechanisms during Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this Outcome-Supervised RL (OSRL) paradigm: the Importance
Sampling (IS) ratios of positive-advantage tokens are mismatched, leading to
unbalanced token weighting for positive and negative tokens. This mismatch
suppresses the update of low-probability tokens while over-amplifying already
high-probability ones. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Importance
Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO), which uses a simple yet effective strategy
that flips the IS ratios of positive-advantage tokens, aligning their update
direction with the learning dynamics of negative ones. AIS further incorporates
a soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize extreme updates while maintaining
gradient flow. Comprehensive experiments on coding and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that ASPO significantly mitigates premature convergence,
improves training stability, and enhances final performance over strong
GRPO-based baselines. Our analysis provides new insights into the role of
token-level weighting in OSRL and highlights the critical importance of
correcting IS in LLM RL. The code and models of ASPO are available at

Motivation: 当前语言模型后训练虽然提升了指令跟随能力，但往往忽视了在多有效答案任务中的代价，特别是上下文可引导性、输出空间覆盖和分布对齐这三个关键特性。

Method: 提出了Spectrum Suite大型评估资源，包含40多个数据源和90多个任务，用于评估模型引导到不同分布的能力。同时提出了Spectrum Tuning后训练方法来提升可引导性和分布覆盖。

Result: 研究发现当前后训练技术虽然有助于激发模型的潜在能力和知识，但会损害模型的上下文灵活引导能力。Spectrum Tuning方法相比预训练模型和指令调优模型，在可引导性、输出空间覆盖和分布对齐方面都有改善。

Conclusion: 语言模型后训练需要在提升指令跟随能力的同时，注意保持模型的上下文可引导性和分布覆盖能力。Spectrum Tuning方法能有效改善这些问题，在保持模型能力的同时提升分布对齐性能。

Abstract: Language model post-training has enhanced instruction-following and
performance on many downstream tasks, but also comes with an often-overlooked
cost on tasks with many possible valid answers. We characterize three
desiderata for conditional distributional modeling: in-context steerability,
valid output space coverage, and distributional alignment, and document across
three model families how current post-training can reduce these properties. In
particular, we disambiguate between two kinds of in-context learning: ICL for
eliciting existing underlying knowledge or capabilities, and in-context
steerability, where a model must use in-context information to override its
priors and steer to a novel data generating distribution. To better evaluate
and improve these desiderata, we introduce Spectrum Suite, a large-scale
resource compiled from >40 data sources and spanning >90 tasks requiring models
to steer to and match diverse distributions ranging from varied human
preferences to numerical distributions and more. We find that while current
post-training techniques help elicit underlying capabilities and knowledge,
they hurt models' ability to flexibly steer in-context. To mitigate these
issues, we propose Spectrum Tuning, a post-training method using Spectrum Suite
to improve steerability and distributional coverage. We find that Spectrum
Tuning often improves over pretrained models and their instruction-tuned
counterparts, enhancing steerability, spanning more of the output space, and
improving distributional alignment on held-out datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏关于模型蒸馏性能如何随数据量缩放的研究，特别是在代码推理领域，需要系统性地探索蒸馏数据量对小型非推理LLM性能的影响。

Method: 在两个小型非推理LLM上进行竞争性编程技能蒸馏实验，研究不同数据量下的性能变化趋势，并在不同蒸馏阶段对相同数据进行微调以验证学习阶段。

Result: 发现竞争性编程性能存在"代码推理谷"现象；在低和中低数据量下，小模型从简单编程问题中获益更多；训练数据中输出的正确性对蒸馏结果无显著影响。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对代码推理蒸馏训练动态的理解，超越了直觉认知，为优化模型蒸馏策略提供了实证基础。

Abstract: Distilling the thinking traces of a Large Language Model (LLM) with reasoning
capabilities into a smaller model has been proven effective. Yet, there is a
scarcity of work done on how model performances scale with the quantity of
distillation data. In this work, we study the scaling trend of distilling
competitive coding skills on two small non-reasoning LLMs. We validate the
hypothesis that there is a $\textit{valley of code reasoning}$: downstream
performance on competitive coding first drops as data quantity increases, then
it steadily increases in a sharper-than-log-linear fashion. Having identified
the trend, we further fine-tune the models at two different distillation stages
on the same data to ground conclusions on their respective learning phases. We
learn that across stages in the low and medium-low data regimes, small models
benefit significantly from easier coding questions than from harder ones. We
also find that, surprisingly, the correctness of outputs in training data makes
no difference to distillation outcomes. Our work represents a step forward in
understanding the training dynamics of code reasoning distillation outside

*Gagan Bhatia,Somayajulu G Sripada,Kevin Allan,Jacobo Azcona*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)框架，识别了幻觉发生的commitment layer，揭示了LLM中幻觉是由联想路径和上下文路径冲突导致的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中幻觉现象的内在架构根源，理解模型生成看似合理但事实错误陈述的根本原因。

Method: 提出了Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)框架，整合现有可解释性技术，创建模型推理的因果映射；识别幻觉变得不可避免的commitment layer；使用双过程理论解释联想路径和上下文路径的冲突。

Result: 发现上下文路径的连贯性与幻觉率呈强负相关（ρ = -0.863），表明幻觉是内部语义弱点的可预测结果；识别了特定的commitment layer和Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks等可预测失败模式。

Conclusion: 为Transformer架构中幻觉如何、何时以及为何发生提供了机制性解释，揭示了幻觉是内部语义弱点导致的系统性失败模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of
plausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the
intrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary
contributions.First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic
failures, we propose \textbf{Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)}, a unified
framework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a
causal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context
(distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a
hallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific \textbf{commitment
layer} where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from
factuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We
observe a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret
using the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic \textbf{associative
pathway} (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate \textbf{contextual pathway}
(akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as
\textit{Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks}. Our framework's ability to quantify the
coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation
($\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are
predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a
mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the
Transformer architecture.

### [84] [Parallel Tokenizers: Rethinking Vocabulary Design for Cross-Lingual Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06128)
*Muhammad Dehan Al Kautsar,Fajri Koto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出并行分词器框架，通过双语词典对齐不同语言的分词器词汇表，使语义等效词具有一致的索引，从而改善多语言表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法在多语言场景下存在语义等效词被映射到不同嵌入的问题，限制了跨语言迁移效果。例如英语"I eat rice"和豪萨语"Ina cin shinkafa"通常被分配到不同词汇索引。

Method: 首先单语训练分词器，然后使用双语词典或词对词翻译进行词汇表对齐，确保语义等效词具有一致索引，强制跨语言共享语义空间并改善生育率平衡。

Result: 在13种低资源语言上预训练transformer编码器，在情感分析、仇恨言论检测、情感分类和句子嵌入相似性任务上，使用并行分词器的模型均优于传统多语言基线。

Conclusion: 重新思考分词方法对于推进多语言表示学习至关重要，特别是在低资源设置下，并行分词器能有效改善跨语言泛化能力。

Abstract: Tokenization defines the foundation of multilingual language models by
determining how words are represented and shared across languages. However,
existing methods often fail to support effective cross-lingual transfer because
semantically equivalent words are assigned distinct embeddings. For example, "I
eat rice" in English and "Ina cin shinkafa" in Hausa are typically mapped to
different vocabulary indices, preventing shared representations and limiting
cross-lingual generalization. We introduce parallel tokenizers. This new
framework trains tokenizers monolingually and then aligns their vocabularies
exhaustively using bilingual dictionaries or word-to-word translation, ensuring
consistent indices for semantically equivalent words. This alignment enforces a
shared semantic space across languages while naturally improving fertility
balance. To assess their effectiveness, we pretrain a transformer encoder from
scratch on thirteen low-resource languages and evaluate it on sentiment
analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and sentence embedding
similarity. Across all tasks, models trained with parallel tokenizers
outperform conventional multilingual baselines, confirming that rethinking
tokenization is essential for advancing multilingual representation
learning--especially in low-resource settings.

*Kangyu Wang,Zhiyun Jiang,Haibo Feng,Weijia Zhao,Lin Liu,Jianguo Li,Zhenzhong Lan,Weiyao Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CreditDecoding是一种无需训练的解码算法，通过Trace Credit机制利用历史logits信息加速扩散大语言模型的并行解码，显著减少冗余迭代，在保持性能的同时实现4-5倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散大语言模型在并行解码时，由于初始置信度低，经常重复掩码token，导致冗余迭代，限制了整体加速效果。

Method: 提出Trace Credit概念量化token收敛潜力，通过融合当前logits和历史Trace Credit来加速正确但置信度不足的token的收敛，减少冗余迭代。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，相比LLaDA-8B-Instruct实现5.48倍加速和0.48性能提升，相比LLaDA-MoE-Instruct实现4.11倍加速和0.15性能提升。

Conclusion: CreditDecoding能有效扩展到长序列，与主流推理优化正交，是一个即插即用的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising steps, achieving parallel decoding by denoising only high-confidence
positions at each step. However, existing approaches often repetitively remask
tokens due to initially low confidence scores, leading to redundant iterations
and limiting overall acceleration. Through the analysis of dLLM decoding
traces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a
token several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical
information and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace
Credit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating
historical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free
parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of
correct but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit.
This process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding
robustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup
and a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times
speedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct.
Importantly, CreditDecoding scales effectively to long sequences and is
orthogonal to mainstream inference optimizations, making it a readily
integrable and versatile solution.

*Jan Cegin,Branislav Pecher,Ivan Srba,Jakub Simko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RoSE方法，用于在没有人工标注测试集的情况下选择最佳LLM生成器，通过在小模型上训练候选生成器的输出并在其他候选LLM生成的合成数据上评估来获得代理指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在低资源语言中，由于缺乏人工标注数据，难以通过外在评估选择最佳LLM生成器，而内在指标与下游性能相关性差的问题。

Method: RoSE方法：训练小模型使用候选生成器的输出，然后在其他候选LLM生成的合成示例上评估该小模型，最终RoSE分数是该小模型的平均性能。

Result: 在6个LLM、11种语言和3个任务上的实验表明，RoSE比任何其他内在启发式方法更频繁地识别出最优生成器，与最优生成器基线的差距仅为0.76个百分点，且是唯一与人工测试数据性能呈正相关的指标。

Conclusion: RoSE是一种有效的代理指标，可以在没有人工测试集的情况下可靠地选择最佳LLM生成器，特别适用于低资源语言场景。

Abstract: LLMs are powerful generators of synthetic data, which are used for training
smaller, specific models. This is especially valuable for low-resource
languages, where human-labelled data is scarce but LLMs can still produce
high-quality text. However, LLMs differ in how useful their outputs are for
training. Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because
extrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations (which are often
unavailable for low-resource languages), while intrinsic metrics correlate
poorly with downstream performance. We introduce Round robin Synthetic data
Evaluation (RoSE), a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without
human test sets. RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate
generator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all
other candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this
small model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment,
topic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other
intrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within
0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline. This result is
measured in terms of downstream performance, obtained by training a small model
on the chosen generator's outputs (optimal vs. proxy metric selected) and
evaluating it on human-labelled test data. Additionally, RoSE is the only
metric to achieve a positive correlation with performance on human test data.

*Dingyu Yao,Chenxu Yang,Zhengyang Tong,Zheng Lin,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VecInfer是一种新颖的向量量化方法，通过平滑和Hadamard变换抑制键缓存中的异常值，实现超低比特位宽下的高效KV缓存压缩，在2位量化时性能接近全精度，同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量量化方法在超低比特位宽下由于键缓存异常值导致性能严重下降，阻碍了代码本的有效利用，需要解决KV缓存的内存开销问题。

Method: 应用平滑和Hadamard变换抑制键缓存异常值，设计优化的CUDA内核融合计算与反量化操作以减少内存访问开销。

Result: 在2位量化下性能接近全精度，大规模自注意力计算加速2.7倍，单批次端到端延迟降低8.3倍（Llama-3.1-8B，196k序列长度）。

Conclusion: VecInfer在超低比特位宽下有效压缩KV缓存，同时保持高性能和高效推理，优于现有量化基线方法。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache introduces substantial memory overhead during large
language model (LLM) inference. Although existing vector quantization (VQ)
methods reduce KV cache usage and provide flexible representational capacity
across bit-widths, they suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low
bit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook
utilization. To address this challenge, we propose VecInfer, a novel VQ method
for aggressive KV cache compression while enabling efficient inference. By
applying smooth and Hadamard transformations, VecInfer suppresses outliers in
the key cache, enabling the codebook to comprehensively cover the original data
distribution and thereby reducing quantization difficulty. To facilitate
efficient deployment, we design an optimized CUDA kernel that fuses computation
with dequantization to minimize memory access overhead. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization
baselines across both long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning
tasks. With only 2-bit quantization, VecInfer achieves performance comparable
to full precision, while delivering up to $\mathbf{2.7\times}$ speedup in
large-batch self-attention computation and $\mathbf{8.3\times}$ reduction in
single-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with a 196k sequence length.

### [88] [Mixing Mechanisms: How Language Models Retrieve Bound Entities In-Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06182)
*Yoav Gur-Arieh,Mor Geva,Atticus Geiger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型在上下文推理中通过位置机制、词汇机制和反射机制三种方式绑定和检索实体，当绑定实体数量增加时，位置机制变得不可靠，模型会混合使用这三种机制来补偿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究发现语言模型通过位置机制进行实体检索，但这种机制在复杂场景下表现不佳，需要研究模型如何应对更多绑定实体的情况。

Method: 在9个模型和10个绑定任务上进行广泛实验，开发结合三种机制的因果模型来估计下一个token分布。

Result: 发现语言模型混合使用位置、词汇和反射三种机制，开发的模型与真实分布达到95%的一致性，并能推广到更长的开放式文本中。

Conclusion: 研究建立了语言模型在上下文中绑定和检索实体的更完整图景，揭示了模型在复杂场景下的混合机制策略。

Abstract: A key component of in-context reasoning is the ability of language models
(LMs) to bind entities for later retrieval. For example, an LM might represent
"Ann loves pie" by binding "Ann" to "pie", allowing it to later retrieve "Ann"
when asked "Who loves pie?" Prior research on short lists of bound entities
found strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional
mechanism, where "Ann" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this
work, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings;
as the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism
becomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we
find that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" using its bound counterpart "pie") and a reflexive mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on
nine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs
mix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to
develop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token
distributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes
to substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity
groups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural
settings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs
bind and retrieve entities in-context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多采用单次设置，忽视了科学研究开发中迭代和反馈驱动的实际工作流程，需要评估LLM在生成正确可执行代码方面的能力。

Method: 创建RECODE-H基准测试，包含结构化指令、单元测试和五级反馈层次；开发ReCodeAgent框架，将反馈集成到迭代代码生成中。

Result: 实验显示，使用GPT-5、Claude-Sonnet-4等领先LLM时，更丰富的反馈能带来显著的性能提升，但复杂研究代码生成仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: RECODE-H为开发适应性强、反馈驱动的LLM代理在科学研究实现中奠定了基础，揭示了反馈机制对提升代码生成质量的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific
research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable
code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring
the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific
research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of
102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents
through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes
structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to
reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present
ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code
generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4,
DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer
feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of
complex research code. RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing
adaptive, feedback-driven LLM agents in scientific research implementation

TL;DR: BanglaTalk是首个针对孟加拉语方言的实时语音助手系统，采用客户端-服务器架构和RTP协议实现低延迟通信，通过方言感知ASR系统BRDialect在10种方言上优化性能，在低带宽下保持4.9秒端到端延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为低资源语言且方言多样性高，现有系统未针对实时使用优化且仅关注标准语，需要开发支持方言的实时语音助手以提升信息可访问性。

Method: 采用客户端-服务器架构，使用RTP协议确保低延迟通信；通过微调IndicWav2Vec模型开发方言感知ASR系统BRDialect，覆盖10种孟加拉语方言。

Result: BRDialect在RegSpeech12数据集上比基线ASR模型提升12.41-33.98%；系统可在24kbps低带宽下运行，平均端到端延迟为4.9秒。

Conclusion: BanglaTalk通过低带宽使用和最小端到端延迟，实现了成本效益和交互性，为多样化的孟加拉语使用者群体提供了包容和可访问的语音技术。

Abstract: Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring
improved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language
with a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in
developing such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use
and focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the
first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects.
BanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address
dialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect,
developed by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional
dialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the
RegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of
24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low
bandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both
cost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and
accessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers.

TL;DR: LST模型通过动态聚合语音标记为潜在语音补丁，解决了自回归语音-文本模型中语音标记序列过长导致的训练和推理效率问题，在语音和文本任务上都取得了更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归语音-文本模型存在语音标记序列远长于文本标记的问题，导致模态间计算不平衡、训练效率低、缩放规律缓慢，阻碍了语音与文本的有效对齐。

Method: 提出潜在语音-文本变换器(LST)，通过动态且低成本地将语音标记聚合为潜在语音补丁，这些补丁可作为更高级别的单元，既能与对应文本单元对齐以促进能力迁移，也能封装常见语音序列以提高计算效率。

Result: LST在语音到语音和文本到文本基准测试中均优于传统方法，在计算控制和数据控制设置下都表现更好。在HellaSwag故事补全任务中，LST在计算控制训练下语音准确率绝对提升6.5%，在数据控制训练下提升5.3%，同时文本性能也有改善。

Conclusion: LST通过潜在语音补丁机制提高了语音-文本模型的数据效率，实现了更有效的表示对齐和更陡峭的缩放规律，为语音-文本模型的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large
number of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech
tokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation
benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the
representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer
from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of
speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute
imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,
and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately
translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce
the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text
models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech
tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units
that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability
transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more
compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on
speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and
compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective
representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for
speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute
gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under
data-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will
release our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further
research.

Motivation: 解决传统关系抽取中缺乏语言解释监督的问题，提升模型的可解释性和一次性学习能力。

Method: 采用认知科学启发的推理机制，结合强化学习优化过程，使用新颖的奖励函数同时提升任务准确性和解释质量，自动构建高质量关键词词典。

Result: 在One-shot NYT29数据集上，CogRE达到24.65% F1值，强化学习优化后性能提升23.46%，人类评估显示解释质量相对提升54%。

Conclusion: CogRE框架有效解决了关系抽取中的注意力不集中和一次性学习能力有限的问题，显著提升了模型性能和可解释性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances
both accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a
reasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of
text-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization
process driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function
designed to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our
approach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for
language-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include
important relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality
dictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our
approach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our
experiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two
common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited
one-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning
with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing
prior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our
reward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human
evaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely
aligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54%
(relative).

Motivation: 传统西方古典音乐记谱法主要依赖线性表示，无法充分捕捉音乐的本质关系维度。作者希望创建一个能够更好表达音乐内部和外部互动性的新音乐形式主义。

Method: 基于范畴量子力学(CQM)及其图表化表示量子图像主义(QPict)，特别是ZX演算，开发量子概念音乐(QCM)语言和理论，显式表示音乐创作、表演和自动化中关键概念间的关系。

Result: 提出了音乐家像贝尔对在测量下互动的乐谱，并概述了现场表演示例。该方法不仅在创作层面影响音乐，还对现场表演有直接影响，并为AI生成音乐提供了新模板。

Conclusion: 量子概念音乐创建了一个强大高效的新音乐形式主义，能够捕捉音乐的互动本质，超越西方古典音乐记谱法的界限，适用于多种音乐流派和方向。

Abstract: We initiate the development of a new language and theory for quantum music,
to which we refer as Quantum Concept Music (QCM). This new music formalism is
based on Categorical Quantum Mechanics (CQM), and more specifically, its
diagrammatic incarnation Quantum Picturalism (QPict), which is heavily based on
ZX-calculus. In fact, it is naturally inherited from CQM/QPict. At its heart is
the explicit notational representation of relations that exist within and
between the key concepts of music composition, performance, and automation. QCM
also enables one to directly translate quantum phenomena into music
compositions in a both intuitively obvious, rigorous and mechanical manner.
  Following this pattern, we propose a score for musicians interacting like a
Bell-pair under measurement, and outline examples of how it could be live
performed. While most of the Western classical music notation has heavily
relied on linear representation of music - which does not always adequately
capture the nature of music - our approach is distinct by highlighting the
fundamental relational dimension of music. In addition, this quantum-based
technique not only influences the music at the profound level of composition,
but also has a direct impact on a live performance, and also provides a new
template for automating music, e.g.~in the context of AI-generation.
  All together, we initiate the creation of new music formalism that is
powerful and efficient in capturing the interactive nature of music, both in
terms of internal and external interactions, and goes beyond the boundaries of
Western classical music notation, which allows to use it in many different
genres and directions.

TL;DR: NANOMIND是一个硬件-软件协同设计框架，将大型多模态模型分解为模块化组件，并在异构加速器上动态调度执行，显著降低了能耗和内存使用，实现了在电池供电设备上本地运行LMMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型通常以整体方式执行，无法充分利用现代SoC中的异构加速器，导致高延迟和低效率。

Method: 将LMMs分解为视觉、语言、音频等模块化"砖块"，通过模块级动态卸载到统一内存SoC中最合适的加速器上，结合定制硬件设计、系统级调度和优化的低位计算内核。

Result: 能耗降低42.3%，GPU内存使用减少11.2%，电池供电设备可运行LLaVA-OneVision近半天，LLaMA-3-8B语音交互达20.8小时。

Conclusion: 模块化设计和异构加速器调度能够显著提升LMMs在资源受限设备上的效率和续航能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are inherently modular, consisting of vision
and audio encoders, projectors, and large language models. Yet, they are almost
always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous
accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end
latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design
inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models
into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its
ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into
modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units.
It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on
unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level
scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our
framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs
entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent
assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher
throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The
design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage
through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system
outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy
consumption by 42.3\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\%. This enables a
battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly half a
day and LLaMA-3-8B for voice interactions up to almost 20.8 hours.

Method: DS-CP框架，系统性地基于测试提示的邻近度重新加权校准样本，在保持有效性的同时增强适应性。

Result: 在MMLU基准测试中，该方法比标准保形预测提供更可靠的覆盖，尤其在显著分布转移下，同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 为LLM在现实世界部署中的可信不确定性量化提供了实用步骤。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive performance across diverse
tasks. However, their tendency to produce overconfident and factually incorrect
outputs, known as hallucinations, poses risks in real world applications.
Conformal prediction provides finite-sample, distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but standard conformal prediction breaks down under domain shift,
often leading to under-coverage and unreliable prediction sets. We propose a
new framework called Domain-Shift-Aware Conformal Prediction (DS-CP). Our
framework adapts conformal prediction to large language models under domain
shift, by systematically reweighting calibration samples based on their
proximity to the test prompt, thereby preserving validity while enhancing
adaptivity. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on the MMLU benchmark
demonstrate that the proposed method delivers more reliable coverage than
standard conformal prediction, especially under substantial distribution
shifts, while maintaining efficiency. This provides a practical step toward
trustworthy uncertainty quantification for large language models in real-world
deployment.

### [96] [Taxonomy of User Needs and Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06124)
*Renee Shelby,Fernando Diaz,Vinodkumar Prabhakaran*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了TUNA（用户需求与行为分类法），这是一个通过分析1193个人机对话构建的三层层次分类框架，用于系统描述用户在对话AI中的行为模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话行为分类法要么过于笼统，要么局限于特定领域，无法全面捕捉用户在对话AI中的实际使用行为和需求。

Method: 通过迭代定性分析1193个人机对话，结合理论回顾和跨情境验证，构建了经验基础的三层分类框架。

Result: 开发了包含信息搜索、综合、程序指导、内容创作、社交互动和元对话等六个主要行为类别的分类体系。

Conclusion: TUNA为描述AI使用提供了系统词汇，支持多尺度评估和跨产品政策协调，有助于设计更安全、响应性更强和更负责任的对话系统。

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of conversational AI highlights the need for frameworks
that capture not only users' instrumental goals but also the situated,
adaptive, and social practices through which they achieve them. Existing
taxonomies of conversational behavior either overgeneralize, remain
domain-specific, or reduce interactions to narrow dialogue functions. To
address this gap, we introduce the Taxonomy of User Needs and Actions (TUNA),
an empirically grounded framework developed through iterative qualitative
analysis of 1193 human-AI conversations, supplemented by theoretical review and
validation across diverse contexts. TUNA organizes user actions into a
three-level hierarchy encompassing behaviors associated with information
seeking, synthesis, procedural guidance, content creation, social interaction,
and meta-conversation. By centering user agency and appropriation practices,
TUNA enables multi-scale evaluation, supports policy harmonization across
products, and provides a backbone for layering domain-specific taxonomies. This
work contributes a systematic vocabulary for describing AI use, advancing both
scholarly understanding and practical design of safer, more responsive, and
more accountable conversational systems.

*Paloma García-de-Herreros,Philipp Slusallek,Dietrich Klakow,Vagrant Gautam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过消融研究比较了编码器专用模型和解码器专用模型在跨模态适应任务中的表现，发现解码器模型表现较差，并提出了两种新方法来提升其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管解码器专用模型在自然语言处理中表现优异且扩展性好，但大多数跨模态适应方法都集中在编码器专用模型上，因此需要研究模型架构对跨模态适应方法的影响。

Method: 进行了一系列消融研究，系统比较编码器专用和解码器专用模型在基于偏微分方程的时间相关模拟任务中的表现，并提出了Parallel Flipping和Sequence Doubling两种新方法。

Result: 发现当现有方法未加修改时，解码器专用模型的表现远不如编码器专用模型，且扩展解码器模型也无帮助。但提出的两种新方法显著提升了所有任务中解码器模型的性能，缩小了与编码器模型的差距。

Conclusion: 通过引入的新方法，解码器专用模型在跨模态适应任务中的性能得到显著提升，有望扩大科学机器学习中使用的模型范围。

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

TL;DR: ARLAS框架通过对抗性强化学习训练LLM代理，使其能够抵御多样化的间接提示注入攻击，同时提高任务完成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖手动构建的攻击数据集，多样性不足，无法应对新型提示注入攻击，存在安全风险。

Method: 采用对抗性强化学习框架，将问题建模为双人零和博弈，同时训练攻击者和防御者LLM，并使用基于种群的学习防止循环学习。

Result: 在BrowserGym和AgentDojo上的评估显示，ARLAS训练的代理攻击成功率显著降低，任务成功率提高，生成的攻击更加多样化和具有挑战性。

Conclusion: ARLAS能够生成多样化攻击并训练出更鲁棒的代理，相比基础模型具有更好的安全性和任务性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出自适应混合位激活量化(AMAQ)方法，通过渐进式压缩激活和梯度来减少大语言模型分布式训练的通信开销，在相同比特预算下优于固定精度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型规模快速增长，给客户端-服务器分布式训练带来通信效率和计算开销的挑战，需要在低资源设备上实现高效协作训练。

Method: 采用参数高效的分割学习，引入AMAQ策略，基于特征和层级重要性通过比特正则化在通道间分配比特预算，渐进式压缩激活和梯度从高精度(6-8位)到低精度(3-4位)。

Result: 在相同比特预算下，AMAQ相比固定精度方法在LLaMA3 8B和Qwen2.5 7B模型上分别提高约2.5%的生成准确率和1.3%的分类准确率，显著提升训练稳定性并减少超低位表示崩溃。

Conclusion: AMAQ能有效集成到实际多机协作训练中，在训练期间仅需适度的通信开销即可提供优越的推理准确率，是通信成本最小化的实用协作训练解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

*Zichong Li,Liming Liu,Chen Liang,Weizhu Chen,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NorMuon是一种结合正交化和神经元级自适应学习率的优化器，通过神经元级归一化解决Muon优化器中神经元更新不平衡问题，在保持良好条件数的同时实现更均衡的参数优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器通过正交化参数更新改善了优化几何条件，但导致神经元更新范数高度不均匀，某些神经元主导优化过程。需要结合Adam的自适应学习率优势来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出NorMuon优化器，为每个神经元维护二阶动量统计，在正交化后应用行级归一化，确保参数均衡利用。在FSDP2框架下开发分布式实现，跨设备分布正交化计算。

Result: 在多个模型规模上的实验表明，NorMuon一致优于Adam和Muon，在1.1B预训练设置中比Adam提高21.74%训练效率，比Muon提高11.31%，同时保持与Muon相当的内存占用。

Conclusion: 正交化和自适应学习率是互补而非竞争的方法，为大规模深度学习中的优化器设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种学习型调度器来替代掩码扩散模型中的启发式调度策略，通过将去噪过程建模为KL正则化的马尔可夫决策过程，优化生成顺序以更好地匹配数据分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型在生成句子时，性能高度依赖于选择哪个位置进行去掩码的顺序。现有方法通常使用基于规则的调度策略（如最大置信度、最大边界），这些方法只能提供临时改进。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为KL正则化的马尔可夫决策过程，具有显式参考策略，优化一个允许策略改进和收敛保证的正则化目标。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，学习到的策略始终优于最大置信度方法：在SUDOKU任务上，相比随机策略提升20.1%，相比最大置信度策略提升11.2%。

Conclusion: 学习型调度器能够生成更接近数据分布的样本，在关键任务中显著优于启发式调度策略。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for
language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked
sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support
any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which
position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules
(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In
contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,
we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an
explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits
policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that
more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,
across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms
max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it
yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

TL;DR: 提出了Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF)方法，通过Entropic Annealing和Look-ahead Modulation技术解决粒子滤波在推理时间缩放中的过早利用问题，显著提升数学推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统粒子滤波方法在过程奖励模型引导下容易产生过早利用问题，由于早期过度自信的评分导致粒子多样性丧失，最终收敛到次优解。

Method: ePF算法包含两个关键技术：Entropic Annealing通过监控搜索多样性并在多样性下降时动态退火重采样分布；Look-ahead Modulation通过评估状态的后续潜力来增强预测指导。

Result: 在多个挑战性数学基准测试中，ePF显著优于强基线方法，任务奖励相对提升高达50%。

Conclusion: ePF通过平衡多样化解空间的探索和高奖励区域的利用，提高了粒子滤波的鲁棒性，最终获得更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more
computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong
ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when
guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early
in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:
it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially
correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,
known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained
computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two
root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident
resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning
path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that
integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,
Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by
monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by
dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The
second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive
guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several
challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and
achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these
methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse
solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately
leading to higher-quality solutions.

TL;DR: 现有混合线性注意力方法存在关键缺陷，几乎完全依赖滑动窗口softmax而绕过线性组件。提出三种解决方案确保组件平衡使用，恢复线性注意力真正采用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的二次计算复杂度限制了可扩展性，线性注意力虽降低复杂度但从头预训练成本高昂。现有后训练线性化方法存在组件使用不平衡问题。

Method: 提出三种方法：(1)推理时混合线性转换与滑动窗口softmax；(2)HedgeCATs结合注意力权重迁移与目标LoRA微调；(3)计划滑动窗口dropout在训练中随机抑制softmax分支。

Result: 方法保持计算效率，恢复大部分基础模型性能，确保真正的线性注意力采用，恢复性能归因的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过平衡组件使用，解决了现有混合线性注意力方法的缺陷，实现了计算效率与性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of
performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于正确性而非置信度的解码策略，通过Greedy-Threshold、Calibrated-TopK和Calibrated-epsilon等方法，在保持多样性的同时提高推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在探索多个推理链时存在矛盾：一方面需要注入随机性来探索多样性，另一方面要确保每个路径的准确性和质量。现有工作要么通过增加不确定性步骤的探索来追求第一个目标，要么通过拒绝低置信度样本来提高可靠性，但这两种方法混淆了不同的不确定性来源。

Method: 提出基于正确性而非置信度的解码校准策略：在估计正确性高的token上采样，在预期正确性低的地方减少采样。具体包括Greedy-Threshold（在极低置信度步骤进行贪婪采样）、Calibrated-TopK和Calibrated-epsilon（基于估计的按秩正确性设置截断阈值）。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中显示出性能提升，挑战了关于不确定性下解码的普遍启发式方法。

Conclusion: 解码规则应该基于正确性而非置信度进行校准，这种方法能够更好地平衡推理多样性和质量，在复杂推理任务中取得更好的效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that
require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse
chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two
competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple
reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.
Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly
uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while
others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence
post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer
quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different
sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should
be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from
tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected
correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:
Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.
Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on
estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing
heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and
general reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于失败感知的逆向强化学习算法，专注于被误分类或难以判断的示例，以更好地恢复RLHF过程中学习到的潜在奖励信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF使大语言模型与人类偏好对齐，但模型内部学习的奖励信号难以解释，存在安全风险。现有IRL方法对所有偏好对同等对待，忽略了最具信息量的失败示例。

Method: 开发了失败感知IRL算法，重点关注被提取的奖励模型误分类或评分相近的示例，通过这些失败案例学习更准确的奖励函数。

Result: 在LLM去毒化任务中，失败感知IRL在多个指标上优于现有IRL基线，无需外部分类器或监督。提取的奖励能更好地反映RLHF的真实目标。

Conclusion: 失败感知IRL是审核模型对齐和减少IRL过程模糊性的稳健、可扩展方法，能更有效地支持重新RLHF训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they
internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and
safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally,
often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted
reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term
\emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that
focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards
defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware
IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind
RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines
across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring
external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields
rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling
more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes
failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and
reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于贝叶斯逆强化学习的LLM目标审计框架，通过量化非可识别性、提供不确定性诊断和验证策略级效用来增强LLM对齐的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型隐式优化的目标缺乏透明度，使得可信对齐和审计成为重大挑战。现有逆强化学习方法要么产生单一过度自信的奖励估计，要么未能解决任务的根本模糊性。

Method: 采用贝叶斯逆强化学习框架，不仅恢复目标分布，还实现三个关键审计能力：量化非可识别性、提供不确定性感知诊断、验证策略级效用。

Result: 该框架成功审计了经过脱毒的LLM，产生了一个校准良好且可解释的目标，增强了对齐保证。实证显示精炼后的低不确定性奖励可直接用于RLHF，实现与真实对齐过程相当的训练动态和毒性降低。

Conclusion: 这项工作为审计师、安全团队和监管机构提供了一个实用工具包，用于验证LLM真正试图实现的目标，推动AI向更可信和可问责的方向发展。

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain
dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand
challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward
functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single,
overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of
the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing
framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a
comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to
not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical
audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing
non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential
rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics
that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where
the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level
utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used
directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions
comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework
successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and
interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this
work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to
verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy
and accountable AI.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows
that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet,
what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely
on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while
instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection
strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define
reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal
effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce
influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and
embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理依赖外部工具解决复杂问题时，搜索轨迹存在结构异质性，导致标准策略梯度方法出现交叉层偏差，扭曲信用分配并阻碍多步搜索策略探索。

Method: 提出Stratified GRPO方法，核心是分层优势归一化(SAN)，基于轨迹结构属性将轨迹划分为同质层，在各层内局部计算优势值，确保轨迹仅与其真实同类比较。

Result: 在多个单跳和多跳问答基准测试中，Stratified GRPO比GRPO性能提升高达11.3分，获得更高训练奖励、更好训练稳定性和更有效的搜索策略。

Conclusion: 分层方法为LLM搜索代理中的结构异质性提供了原则性解决方案，SAN消除了交叉层偏差，保持了全局无偏性和单位方差特性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement
learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the
trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations
in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally
different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient
methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and
formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of
heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment
and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address
this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage
Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on
their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each
stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true
peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields
conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains
the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard
normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To
improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly
blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that
Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3
points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more
effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a
principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.

### [109] [Optimization Modeling via Semantic Anchored Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05115)
*Yansen Zhang,Qingcan Kang,Yujie Chen,Yufei Wang,Xiongwei Han,Tao Zhong,Mingxuan Yuan,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了SAC-Opt框架，通过语义锚点驱动的后向修正来提升LLM生成优化模型代码的准确性和鲁棒性，相比传统基于求解器反馈的方法能更好地避免语义错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成优化模型的方法主要依赖求解器驱动，通过单次前向生成和有限的错误修复，容易产生语法正确但逻辑错误的模型，无法检测语义错误。

Method: SAC-Opt采用后向引导修正框架，将原始语义锚点与生成代码重构的锚点对齐，选择性修正不匹配的组件，实现细粒度的约束和目标逻辑优化。

Result: 在7个公共数据集上的实验表明，SAC-Opt将平均建模准确率提升了7.8%，在ComplexLP数据集上提升高达21.9%。

Conclusion: 语义锚点修正在基于LLM的优化工作流中至关重要，能确保从问题意图到求解器可执行代码的忠实转换。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

*Radha Gulhane,Sathish Reddy Indurthi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出混合奖励建模框架，结合模型奖励和规则奖励，通过多维度奖励和多方面奖励来改进多模态大语言模型的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单信号模型奖励方法缺乏跨领域任务的置信度校准，无法捕捉人类偏好的多样性，且需要大量数据标注和奖励模型训练。

Method: 混合奖励建模框架：1）模型奖励：从合成和人类反馈中预测标量或向量分数；2）规则奖励：领域特定启发式提供显式正确性信号；3）多方面奖励：加强指令遵循；4）广义长度惩罚奖励：稳定训练。

Result: 在3B模型家族中，通用和数学推理任务平均提升约9.5%，数学基准测试平均提升约16%。

Conclusion: 混合和多方面奖励建模为多模态大语言模型对齐提供了灵活有效的强化学习策略优化方法。

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现AI模型在编程任务中表现出类似人类的邓宁-克鲁格效应，即能力不足的模型更容易高估自己的能力，特别是在不熟悉或资源稀缺的编程语言中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在创意和技术领域与人类合作日益增多，需要了解影响共同代理的认知边界和偏见，特别是AI是否也会像人类一样表现出过度自信的认知偏差。

Method: 通过分析模型在不同编程语言中的置信度和表现，研究AI模型在编码任务中的自信程度与实际能力之间的关系。

Result: 实验表明，能力较弱的模型和在罕见编程语言中操作的模型表现出更强的DKE类似偏差，偏差强度与模型能力成比例。

Conclusion: AI模型确实会像人类一样表现出邓宁-克鲁格效应，这种认知偏差在模型能力不足或面对不熟悉领域时更为明显。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

*Aman Gupta,Denny O'Shea,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VAL-Bench是一个评估大型语言模型在争议性话题中是否保持稳定价值立场的基准测试，通过对比模型在正反两方观点提示下的回答一致性来衡量价值对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注拒绝回答或安全违规检测，但无法评估模型在面对现实争议问题时是否坚持一致的价值体系。

Method: 使用维基百科争议章节构建115K对正反观点提示，通过LLM作为评判者来评估模型回答的一致性。

Result: 测试发现不同模型在价值对齐方面存在显著差异，安全策略与表达性价值系统之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: VAL-Bench提供了一个可扩展、可复现的基准，能够系统性地比较LLM如何可靠地体现人类价值观。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs
shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

*Zhuofeng Li,Haoxiang Zhang,Seungju Han,Sheng Liu,Jianwen Xie,Yu Zhang,Yejin Choi,James Zou,Pan Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentFlow是一个可训练的在线智能体框架，通过四个模块（规划器、执行器、验证器、生成器）和演化内存协调工作，在多重交互循环中直接优化规划器，解决了传统工具增强方法在长视野和多样化工具下的扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工具增强方法训练单一、整体的策略，在长视野和多样化工具下扩展性差，对新场景泛化能力弱。智能体系统通过分解工作到专门模块提供了有前景的替代方案，但大多数仍是无训练的或依赖与多重交互动态解耦的离线训练。

Method: 提出AgentFlow框架，包含四个协调模块和演化内存，并开发Flow-GRPO方法在实时环境中进行策略内训练，通过将多重优化转化为可处理的单轮策略更新来解决长视野、稀疏奖励的信用分配问题。

Result: 在十个基准测试中，使用7B规模骨干的AgentFlow在搜索任务上平均准确率提升14.9%，智能体任务提升14.0%，数学任务提升14.5%，科学任务提升4.1%，甚至超过了更大的专有模型如GPT-4o。

Conclusion: AgentFlow通过在线优化显著提升了规划能力、工具调用可靠性，并在模型规模和推理轮次上表现出正向扩展性，验证了在线优化方法的优势。

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

### [114] [ARM: Discovering Agentic Reasoning Modules for Generalizable Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05746)
*Bohan Yao,Shiva Krishna Reddy Malay,Vikas Yadav*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ARM（Agentic Reasoning Module）新范式，通过代码空间树搜索自动优化CoT推理模块，显著优于手动设计和现有自动MAS设计方法，并展现出优秀的跨模型和跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动多智能体系统设计方法性能不佳，需要为每个新任务重新发现架构且依赖昂贵的数据标注。观察到简单CoT推理与复杂系统性能相当，因此需要深入研究MAS的基本推理单元。

Method: 引入ARM作为CoT的智能体化泛化，每个推理步骤由专门模块执行。通过代码空间树搜索从简单CoT模块开始，利用执行轨迹反思指导突变来进化模块。

Result: 显著优于手动设计的MAS和最先进的自动MAS设计方法。基于ARM构建的MAS在不同基础模型和任务领域都保持高性能，无需进一步优化。

Conclusion: ARM为自动MAS设计提供了新范式，通过优化基本推理单元实现了卓越性能和泛化能力，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于混合参与度得分的早期预测方法，使用多模态特征在30-420分钟时间窗口内预测网络迷因的病毒式传播，XGBoost模型在30分钟内即可达到PR-AUC > 0.52。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测在线内容的病毒式传播具有挑战性，特别是对于文化复杂、快速演变的迷因。研究旨在探索早期预测迷因病毒式传播的可行性。

Method: 使用来自25个不同Reddit社区的大规模跨语言数据集，提出基于混合参与度得分的病毒性定义方法，评估了逻辑回归、XGBoost和MLP等模型，采用包含静态内容和时间动态的多模态特征集。

Result: XGBoost表现最佳，在30分钟内达到PR-AUC > 0.52。分析揭示了"证据转换"现象：随着迷因获得关注，特征重要性从静态上下文动态转向时间动态。

Conclusion: 本研究为早期病毒性预测建立了稳健、可解释且实用的基准，贡献了新颖的跨语言数据集和方法论上合理的病毒性定义方法。

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

TL;DR: 提出MatheMagic方法构建动态反事实数学基准，通过改变数字和运算符的语义来测试模型推理能力，避免过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准存在过拟合风险，因为测试集公开后可能被模型记忆，且符号和规则多样性有限，答案封闭。

Method: 使用MatheMagic生成数学测试实例，随机改变数字和运算符的语义但保持答案可自动验证，在测试时动态构建实例评估模型归纳或演绎能力。

Result: 模型更容易解决演绎任务而非归纳任务，但会回归到标准数学推理。数学适应模型未能展现通用推理技能，归纳任务的微调泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效揭示模型过拟合并测量真实推理能力，显示当前模型缺乏通用推理技能，归纳任务微调效果有限。

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

Motivation: 解决标准RAG在法律领域中的核心限制，特别是如何在不牺牲确定性属性的情况下可靠查询结构化知识。

Method: 引入以规范动作为中心的查询执行层，通过有向无环图分解复杂查询，实现两层架构分离概率性发现和确定性检索。

Result: 实现了高精度混合搜索、鲁棒引用解析、时间点版本检索和可审计因果追踪，将检索从不透明的黑盒转变为透明可审计的过程。

Conclusion: SAT-Graph API通过两层架构直接满足高风险领域对可解释AI的要求，实现了从黑盒检索到透明可审计过程的转变。

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: MixReasoning框架通过动态调整推理深度，在困难步骤进行详细推理，在简单步骤进行简洁推理，从而缩短推理长度并提高效率，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型对所有步骤采用相同深度的推理，但实际子问题难度差异很大，导致大量冗余。需要让推理模型能够自适应地调整推理深度。

Method: 提出MixReasoning框架，在单个响应中动态调整推理深度，形成混合推理链：对困难步骤进行详细推理，对简单步骤进行简洁推理。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500和AIME数据集上的实验表明，MixReasoning缩短了推理长度，显著提高了效率，且没有影响准确性。

Conclusion: MixReasoning通过自适应调整推理深度，有效解决了推理冗余问题，在保持准确性的同时大幅提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: TaTToo是一个新颖的表格基础过程奖励模型框架，通过显式推理表格操作步骤和集成工具验证来提升大型推理模型在表格推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型在监督文本推理步骤方面表现良好，但在处理表格特定操作（如子表检索和模式交互）时存在困难，导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 设计了可扩展的数据构建流程，收集了6万多个高质量步骤级标注，采用双阶段训练范式：冷启动监督微调学习工具使用推理模式，然后通过强化学习结合工具基础奖励塑形来对齐表格验证。

Result: 在5个具有挑战性的表格推理基准测试中，TaTToo在推理时提升下游策略模型性能30.9%，仅用8B参数就超越了Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B等强基线，并在不同测试时扩展策略中展现出强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: TaTToo框架有效解决了表格推理领域的过程奖励监督问题，通过工具验证和显式表格操作推理显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),
particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their
potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains
underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing
PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle
with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema
interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this
limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)
reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based
verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design
a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality
step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with
tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a
dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use
reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded
reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly
designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering
numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves
downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines
such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong
generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

TL;DR: Sci-Phi是一个空间音频大语言模型，通过双空间和频谱编码器，能够全面估计所有声源和环境的完整参数集，实现完整的空间场景描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频语言模型在声音识别方面表现出色，但单通道输入从根本上限制了空间理解能力。需要开发能够理解声音空间特性的模型。

Method: 使用双空间和频谱编码器，从超过4000小时的合成一阶Ambisonics录音中学习，能够一次性列举和描述多达四个定向声源，以及非定向背景声音和房间特性。

Result: 模型在15个指标上表现出色，涵盖内容、位置、时序、响度和混响，对真实房间脉冲响应具有良好的泛化能力，性能下降较小。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了第一个能够进行完整空间场景描述的音频LLM，具有强大的实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Acoustic scene perception involves describing the type of sounds, their
timing, their direction and distance, as well as their loudness and
reverberation. While audio language models excel in sound recognition,
single-channel input fundamentally limits spatial understanding. This work
presents Sci-Phi, a spatial audio large language model with dual spatial and
spectral encoders that estimates a complete parameter set for all sound sources
and the surrounding environment. Learning from over 4,000 hours of synthetic
first-order Ambisonics recordings including metadata, Sci-Phi enumerates and
describes up to four directional sound sources in one pass, alongside
non-directional background sounds and room characteristics. We evaluate the
model with a permutation-invariant protocol and 15 metrics covering content,
location, timing, loudness, and reverberation, and analyze its robustness
across source counts, signal-to-noise ratios, reverberation levels, and
challenging mixtures of acoustically, spatially, or temporally similar sources.
Notably, Sci-Phi generalizes to real room impulse responses with only minor
performance degradation. Overall, this work establishes the first audio LLM
capable of full spatial-scene description, with strong potential for real-world
deployment. Demo: https://sci-phi-audio.github.io/demo

Motivation: 当前基于思维链的多模态大语言模型在图像生成中存在视觉过度思考问题，导致计算成本增加和与原始提示矛盾的细节。

Method: 引入自适应奖励函数，根据任务难度调整奖励，结合强化学习范式优化思维链的简洁性。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和GenEval等多个基准测试中，推理长度减少54%，同时保持或略微提升质量指标。

Conclusion: ShortCoTI提高了计算效率，同时保持了生成图像的保真度和视觉吸引力。

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

Abstract: The rapid development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has
catalyzed a transformative technological revolution across all walks of life.
As the backbone of wideband communication, optical networks are expecting
high-level autonomous operation and zero-touch management to accommodate their
expanding network scales and escalating transmission bandwidth. The integration
of GenAI is deemed as the pivotal solution for realizing zero-touch optical
networks. However, the lifecycle management of optical networks involves a
multitude of tasks and necessitates seamless collaboration across multiple
layers, which poses significant challenges to the existing single-agent GenAI
systems. In this paper, we propose a GenAI-driven hierarchical multi-agent
framework designed to streamline multi-task autonomous execution for zero-touch
optical networks. We present the architecture, implementation, and applications
of this framework. A field-deployed mesh network is utilized to demonstrate
three typical scenarios throughout the lifecycle of optical network: quality of
transmission estimation in the planning stage, dynamic channel adding/dropping
in the operation stage, and system capacity increase in the upgrade stage. The
case studies, illustrate the capabilities of multi-agent framework in
multi-task allocation, coordination, execution, evaluation, and summarization.
This work provides a promising approach for the future development of
intelligent, efficient, and collaborative network management solutions, paving
the way for more specialized and adaptive zero-touch optical networks.

### [123] [WaveSP-Net: Learnable Wavelet-Domain Sparse Prompt Tuning for Speech Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05305)

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种参数高效的语音深度伪造检测前端，结合提示调优和信号处理变换，并设计了WaveSP-Net架构，在保持低可训练参数的同时显著提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音深度伪造检测前端通常需要完全微调大型预训练模型，参数效率低且对真实场景数据的泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出了融合提示调优和信号处理变换的参数高效前端，包括傅里叶变换和两种小波变换变体，以及结合Partial-WSPT-XLSR前端和双向Mamba后端的WaveSP-Net架构。

Result: WaveSP-Net在两个新基准测试Deepfake-Eval-2024和SpoofCeleb上优于多个最先进模型，参数量低且性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多分辨率特征注入提示嵌入，增强了合成伪影的定位能力，同时保持冻结的XLSR参数不变，实现了参数高效的高性能检测。

Abstract: Modern front-end design for speech deepfake detection relies on full
fine-tuning of large pre-trained models like XLSR. However, this approach is
not parameter-efficient and may lead to suboptimal generalization to realistic,
in-the-wild data types. To address these limitations, we introduce a new family
of parameter-efficient front-ends that fuse prompt-tuning with classical signal
processing transforms. These include FourierPT-XLSR, which uses the Fourier
Transform, and two variants based on the Wavelet Transform: WSPT-XLSR and
Partial-WSPT-XLSR. We further propose WaveSP-Net, a novel architecture
combining a Partial-WSPT-XLSR front-end and a bidirectional Mamba-based
back-end. This design injects multi-resolution features into the prompt
embeddings, which enhances the localization of subtle synthetic artifacts
without altering the frozen XLSR parameters. Experimental results demonstrate
that WaveSP-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art models on two new and
challenging benchmarks, Deepfake-Eval-2024 and SpoofCeleb, with low trainable
parameters and notable performance gains. The code and models are available at

### [124] [TokenChain: A Discrete Speech Chain via Semantic Token Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06201)
*Mingxuan Wang,Satoshi Nakamura*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: TokenChain是一个完全离散的语音链，通过语义标记ASR和两阶段TTS的耦合，在联合改进ASR和TTS方面超越了基线性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟人类感知-生产循环的机器语音链被证明能有效联合改进ASR和TTS，但需要探索在标记接口和模型下链式学习的有效性。

Method: 提出TokenChain：包含语义标记ASR与两阶段TTS（自回归文本到语义模型与掩码生成语义到声学模型），使用直通argmax/Gumbel-Softmax实现端到端反馈，并通过动态权重平均与监督ASR平衡。

Result: 在LibriSpeech上，TokenChain比基线早2-6个epoch达到更高准确率，错误率降低5-13%；在TED-LIUM上，ASR WER相对降低56%，T2S WER降低31%，且遗忘最小。

Conclusion: 链式学习在标记接口和模型下仍然有效，TokenChain证明了离散语音链的优越性能。

Abstract: Machine Speech Chain, simulating the human perception-production loop, proves
effective in jointly improving ASR and TTS. We propose TokenChain, a fully
discrete speech chain coupling semantic-token ASR with a two-stage TTS: an
autoregressive text-to-semantic model co-trained with ASR and a
masked-generative semantic-to-acoustic model for synthesis only. End-to-end
feedback across the text interface is enabled with straight-through
argmax/Gumbel-Softmax and balanced with supervised ASR via dynamic weight
averaging. Ablations examine optimal temperature schedules for in- and
cross-domain transfer. Evaluation reveals TokenChain surpasses baseline
accuracy 2-6 epochs earlier and yields 5-13% lower equal-epoch error with
stable T2S on LibriSpeech, and reduces relative ASR WER by 56% and T2S WER by
31% on TED-LIUM with minimal forgetting, showing that chain learning remains
effective with token interfaces and models.

### [125] [Towards Reliable and Practical LLM Security Evaluations via Bayesian Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05709)
*Mary Llewellyn,Annie Gray,Josh Collyer,Michael Harries*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端的框架来评估LLM对提示注入攻击的脆弱性，包括实验设计和贝叶斯层次模型，应用于Transformer和Mamba架构的安全评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法不可靠，难以准确比较不同LLM的脆弱性，且无法有效处理输出不确定性和计算资源限制的问题。

Method: 提出实验设计方案解决不公平的LLM比较问题，并开发贝叶斯层次模型结合嵌入空间聚类来改进不确定性量化。

Result: 模型在多个提示注入攻击场景中显示出改进的推理能力，发现考虑输出变异性会得到不那么确定的结论，但在某些攻击中Transformer和Mamba变体显示出显著增加的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估LLM脆弱性提供了原则性和实用的方法，强调了考虑输出不确定性的重要性，并揭示了特定架构在不同训练数据或数学能力下的安全风险。

Abstract: Before adopting a new large language model (LLM) architecture, it is critical
to understand vulnerabilities accurately. Existing evaluations can be difficult
to trust, often drawing conclusions from LLMs that are not meaningfully
comparable, relying on heuristic inputs or employing metrics that fail to
capture the inherent uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a principled and
practical end-to-end framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt
injection attacks. First, we propose practical approaches to experimental
design, tackling unfair LLM comparisons by considering two practitioner
scenarios: when training an LLM and when deploying a pre-trained LLM. Second,
we address the analysis of experiments and propose a Bayesian hierarchical
model with embedding-space clustering. This model is designed to improve
uncertainty quantification in the common scenario that LLM outputs are not
deterministic, test prompts are designed imperfectly, and practitioners only
have a limited amount of compute to evaluate vulnerabilities. We show the
improved inferential capabilities of the model in several prompt injection
attack settings. Finally, we demonstrate the pipeline to evaluate the security
of Transformer versus Mamba architectures. Our findings show that consideration
of output variability can suggest less definitive findings. However, for some
attacks, we find notably increased Transformer and Mamba-variant
vulnerabilities across LLMs with the same training data or mathematical
ability.
