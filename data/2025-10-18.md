### [1] [Bridging the Semantic Gap: Contrastive Rewards for Multilingual Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13827)
*Ashish Kattamuri,Ishita Prasad,Meetu Malhotra,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Albert Lie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合组相对策略优化(GRPO)和多语言对比奖励信号的新框架，用于提升跨语言Text-to-SQL系统的任务效率和语义准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法仅关注可执行查询，忽略了语义对齐挑战，包括查询语义含义和执行结果正确性。从英语到其他语言时，执行准确率平均下降6个百分点。

Method: 在GRPO框架中使用多语言对比奖励信号，通过基于语义相似度的奖励信号来改善SQL生成与用户意图的对应关系。

Result: 在七语言MultiSpider数据集上，使用GRPO微调LLaMA-3-3B模型将执行准确率提升至87.4%(比零样本+26pp)，语义准确率提升至52.29%(+32.86pp)。添加对比奖励信号后，平均语义准确率进一步提升至59.14%(+6.85pp)。仅用3000个强化学习训练样本，3B模型在执准确率上超越8B模型7.43个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过对比奖励信号进行定向语义对齐，可以在不需要大规模训练数据集的情况下显著提升Text-to-SQL系统的性能。

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

### [2] [From Explainability to Action: A Generative Operational Framework for Integrating XAI in Clinical Mental Health Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13828)
*Ratna Kandala,Akshata Kishore Moharir,Divya Arvinda Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了生成式操作框架，利用大语言模型作为核心翻译引擎，将XAI技术输出转化为临床可用的叙述性报告，解决心理健康筛查中技术透明度与临床实用性之间的鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释人工智能(XAI)技术在心理健康筛查中存在实验室到临床的转化鸿沟，虽然能产生技术准确的特征重要性分数，但无法提供临床相关、可操作的见解，阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 提出生成式操作框架，以大语言模型为核心翻译引擎，结合检索增强生成(RAG)技术，将多种XAI工具的技术输出与临床指南整合，自动生成人类可读、有证据支持的临床叙述。

Result: 该框架能够直接解决关键操作障碍，包括工作流程集成、偏见缓解和利益相关者特定沟通，推动从孤立数据点生成向集成化、可操作且可信赖的AI交付转变。

Conclusion: 通过将技术透明度转化为临床实用性，生成式操作框架为在临床实践中实现集成化、可操作且可信赖的人工智能提供了战略路线图。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

### [3] [A Linguistics-Aware LLM Watermarking via Syntactic Predictability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13829)
*Shinwoo Park,Hyejin Park,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STELA是一个公开可验证的水印框架，通过基于词性n-gram的语言自由度动态调整水印强度，在保持文本质量的同时增强检测鲁棒性，无需访问模型logits。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法依赖模型特定信号（如token级熵），需要访问模型logits，这阻碍了公开验证。需要一种不依赖模型内部信号的水印方法。

Method: 使用词性n-gram建模语言不确定性，在语法约束强的上下文减弱水印信号以保持质量，在语言灵活性高的上下文增强信号以提高可检测性，检测器无需模型logits。

Result: 在分析型英语、孤立型汉语和黏着型韩语等多种语言类型上的实验表明，STELA在检测鲁棒性上优于先前方法。

Conclusion: STELA通过语言自由度动态调整水印强度，实现了公开可验证的水印检测，在保持文本质量的同时显著提升了检测鲁棒性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/stela_watermark.

### [4] [Users as Annotators: LLM Preference Learning from Comparison Mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13830)
*Zhongze Cai,Xiaocheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过用户比较模式收集成对偏好数据的新方法，利用不同模型生成响应来推断用户数据质量，并通过EM算法估计用户质量因子来过滤数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对偏好数据依赖专业人工标注，成本高。随着LLM普及，用户在日常交互中产生大量偏好标签，但缺乏质量控制。用户最了解自己查询的最佳响应，但标注质量参差不齐。

Method: 从不同模型生成两个响应，利用不对称性推断用户数据质量。提出用户行为模型，开发期望最大化算法估计用户潜在质量因子，据此过滤用户标注数据。

Result: 下游任务验证了该方法在捕捉用户行为和LLM对齐数据过滤方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 用户比较模式是收集成对偏好数据的可行替代方案，通过质量估计和过滤机制可以提升数据质量，有助于LLM对齐。

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

### [5] [Informed Routing in LLMs: Smarter Token-Level Computation for Faster Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13831)
*Chao Han,Yijuan Liang,Zihao Xuan,Daokuan Wu,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为informed routing的新范式，通过轻量级特征预测器(LFF)来评估token的重要性和可恢复性，实现执行或近似策略，在保持模型性能的同时大幅减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态token级计算分配方法依赖贪婪路由，导致不可逆信息丢失和次优token选择，限制了LLMs在实际应用中的部署。

Method: 引入informed routing范式，使用轻量级特征预测器(LFF)在路由决策前预测单元输出，实现执行或近似策略。

Result: 在语言建模和推理任务上实现了最先进的效率-性能权衡，无需最终LoRA微调即可匹配或超越需要完全微调的基线方法，同时减少50%以上的训练时间。

Conclusion: informed routing通过前瞻性评估token重要性和可恢复性，有效解决了贪婪路由的信息丢失问题，为LLMs的高效部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

### [6] [Entropy Meets Importance: A Unified Head Importance-Entropy Score for Stable and Efficient Transformer Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13832)
*Minsik Choi,Hyegang Son,Changhoon Kim,Young Geun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HIES剪枝标准，结合头部重要性分数和注意力熵，相比仅使用HIS的方法在模型质量和稳定性上分别提升15.2%和2.04倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的多层和注意力头结构导致推理效率问题，现有基于HIS的剪枝方法仅考虑梯度驱动贡献，忽略了注意力模式的多样性

Method: 提出HIES剪枝标准，整合头部重要性分数和注意力熵，提供关于每个头部贡献的互补证据

Result: 基于HIES的剪枝在模型质量上提升15.2%，稳定性提升2.04倍，实现显著模型压缩而不牺牲准确性或稳定性

Conclusion: HIES通过结合重要性和熵信息，克服了HIS方法的局限性，实现了更有效的Transformer模型剪枝

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

### [7] [ConDABench: Interactive Evaluation of Language Models for Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13835)
*Avik Dutta,Priyanshu Gupta,Hosein Hasanbeig,Rahul Pratap Singh,Harshit Nigam,Sumit Gulwani,Arjun Radhakrishna,Gustavo Soares,Ashish Tiwari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConDABench是一个用于生成对话式数据分析基准测试的框架，包含多智能体工作流生成的1,420个问题，以及首个系统评估对话数据分析工具的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据分析任务往往目标不明确且数据不干净，需要用户交互来理解意图，但现有基准测试缺乏对这些复杂性和交互性的支持。

Method: 使用多智能体工作流从公开数据集的文章中生成真实基准测试，创建1,420个对话式数据分析问题，并提供评估工具。

Result: 评估显示新一代LLM能解决更多实例，但在需要持续长时交互的任务上表现并不更好。

Conclusion: ConDABench为模型构建者提供了衡量真正协作模型进展的途径，能够完成复杂的交互任务。

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and
unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a
user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these
complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce
ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA)
benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench
consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from
articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA
problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for
the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational
data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation
of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better
at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an
avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative
models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型的不确定性量化方法，提出了一种基于相似性的黑盒框架来评估LLM生成输出的置信度，并在问答、摘要和文本到SQL等任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不确定性量化对于构建可信AI系统至关重要，黑盒方法具有适应性强、成本低等优势，但现有方法在复杂生成任务中的效果需要进一步研究。

Method: 提出了一个高层次的非语言化相似性聚合框架，包含多种UQ方法，并引入了使用小训练集训练置信度估计模型的新技术。

Result: 在问答、摘要和文本到SQL等多样化任务上的实证研究表明，提出的基于相似性的方法比基线方法能产生更好校准的置信度。

Conclusion: 基于相似性的黑盒不确定性量化方法在复杂生成任务中表现优异，能够有效评估LLM生成输出的可靠性。

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

### [9] [Seeing Hate Differently: Hate Subspace Modeling for Culture-Aware Hate Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13837)
*Weibin Cai,Reza Zafarani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种文化感知的仇恨言论检测框架，通过构建个体仇恨子空间来解决训练标签偏见和文化背景差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法忽略了现实世界的复杂性：训练标签存在偏见，不同文化背景个体对仇恨言论的认定标准存在差异。

Method: 构建文化感知框架，通过建模文化属性组合来缓解数据稀疏性，使用标签传播捕捉每个组合的独特特征，构建个体仇恨子空间。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有指标上平均比现有最优方法提升1.05%。

Conclusion: 文化感知的仇恨子空间方法能有效处理仇恨言论检测中的文化差异和标签模糊问题，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大语言模型从原始评论文本中自动提取产品本体（以部分关系形式）的方法，该方法优于现有的基于BERT的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建本体耗时、昂贵且费力，而当前数字时代需要组织大量非结构化文本，特别是在电子商务领域需要适当的产品组织。

Method: 利用大语言模型的最新进展，开发了一种从原始评论文本中全自动提取产品本体的方法，以部分关系的形式呈现。

Result: 通过LLM作为评估器进行评估，证明该方法产生的本体优于现有的基于BERT的基线。

Conclusion: 这项研究为更广泛地使用LLM进行（产品或其它）本体提取奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADMIT是一种针对RAG事实核查系统的知识投毒攻击方法，能够在极低投毒率下有效翻转事实核查决策并诱导欺骗性解释


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究真实世界事实核查场景中的知识投毒威胁，因为可信证据通常主导检索结果，使得传统攻击方法在此场景下效果有限

Method: 提出ADMIT攻击技术，这是一种少样本、语义对齐的投毒方法，无需访问目标LLM、检索器或令牌级控制，通过多注入技术实现攻击

Result: 在4个检索器、11个LLM和4个跨领域基准测试中，ADMIT平均攻击成功率达86%，投毒率仅为0.93×10^-6，且在有强反证据时仍保持鲁棒性

Conclusion: ADMIT攻击暴露了现实世界基于RAG的事实核查系统的显著脆弱性，相比现有最先进攻击方法，攻击成功率提高了11.2%

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SerialBEHRT是一个针对医疗领域的预训练基础模型，通过将电子健康记录序列化处理，解决了现有方法在捕捉患者纵向依赖关系方面的限制，在抗生素敏感性预测任务上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗基础模型难以协调电子健康记录的表格化和事件化特性与自然语言模型的序列先验之间的结构不匹配，限制了捕捉患者就诊间纵向依赖关系的能力。

Method: 扩展SciBERT模型，通过在结构化电子健康记录序列上进行额外预训练，设计SerialBEHRT模型来编码临床事件间的时间和上下文关系。

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务上，SerialBEHRT相比最先进的电子健康记录表示策略实现了更优越和更一致的性能。

Conclusion: 时间序列化在医疗基础模型预训练中具有重要意义，SerialBEHRT证明了其在捕捉临床事件间依赖关系方面的有效性。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

### [13] [DynaSpec: Context-aware Dynamic Speculative Sampling for Large-Vocabulary Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13847)
*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynaSpec提出了一种上下文相关的动态词汇表剪裁方法，通过轻量级元分类器将上下文路由到少量token簇，解决传统固定词汇表剪裁方法在加速LLM推理时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定词汇表剪裁方法存在两个问题：频率列表依赖语料库且需要重新调优，静态短列表抑制罕见或领域特定token，降低每次验证步骤的预期token数量。

Method: 使用轻量级粗粒度元分类器将上下文路由到少量token簇，选择的前k个簇的并集形成草稿器的短列表，同时验证保留完整词汇表和精确性。通过并行执行草稿编码和元短列表计算来提前完成元分类器计算。

Result: 在标准推测解码基准测试中，相比固定短列表基线，观察到平均接受长度的持续提升，同时上下文相关选择使得更小的短列表不会降低接受率。

Conclusion: DynaSpec提供了一种鲁棒的上下文相关动态短列表机制，能够加速草稿生成并在多样化任务中泛化良好。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

Method: 在组合的摘要和翻译LoRA适配器上添加可学习投影层，实现任务间的有效集成，同时保持计算效率。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在云端和设备端都表现良好且快速，开发的Android应用能够无缝执行组合任务。

Conclusion: 该框架在需要高速操作和资源受限的真实应用场景中具有潜在优势，展示了组合多任务处理的实用可行性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream
tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

*Andrey Goncharov,Nikolai Kondusov,Alexey Zaytsev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的推理时方法，通过PCA识别语言方向并引导token嵌入来控制语言身份，有效减少多语言大模型中的代码切换现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型经常出现非预期的代码切换，降低了在下游任务中的可靠性。

Method: 使用潜在空间语言引导方法，通过对平行翻译进行PCA识别语言方向，并沿这些轴引导token嵌入来控制语言身份。

Result: 实现了95-99%的语言分类准确率，在多个语言对上将下一个token分布差异减少了高达42%，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 语言身份在最终层集中且具有近乎完美的线性可分性，该方法能有效缓解代码切换同时保持语义完整性。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

TL;DR: 该论文发现成功的LLM推理具有全局非均匀的信息密度特征，这与人类沟通模式形成鲜明对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受心理语言学中均匀信息密度假设的启发，分析LLM推理过程中的信息流，以解决中间步骤不忠实或难以解释的问题。

Method: 引入基于熵的指标来分析推理轨迹中的信息流，在三个数学基准测试上进行实验。

Result: 发现成功的LLM推理呈现出信息密度的不均匀波动，与人类沟通模式相反。

Conclusion: 这一发现挑战了关于机器推理的假设，并为设计可解释和自适应推理模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

TL;DR: EvoEdit是一种新颖的模型编辑策略，通过顺序零空间对齐来缓解灾难性干扰，实现稳定高效的LLM编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于定位-编辑框架的方法在顺序编辑场景中存在灾难性干扰问题，新编辑会损害先前集成的更新和保留知识。

Method: 采用顺序零空间对齐策略，为每个传入编辑执行零空间对齐，保留原始和先前修改的知识表示。

Result: 在真实世界顺序知识编辑基准测试中，EvoEdit达到或优于现有最先进方法，速度提升高达3.53倍。

Conclusion: EvoEdit为动态演化信息环境中的LLM设计提供了简单有效且具有强理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

*Peter Banyas,Shristi Sharma,Alistair Simmons,Atharva Vispute*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConsistencyAI是一个独立基准测试，用于衡量大型语言模型在不同用户身份下的回答一致性。研究发现不同LLM的事实一致性存在显著差异，且受话题和提供商影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试当不同人口统计特征的用户提出相同问题时，LLM是否会给出事实不一致的回答，旨在提供公正的评估和问责机制。

Method: 对19个LLM进行测试，每个模型针对15个话题请求5个事实，重复100次，每次使用不同用户身份的提示语境。通过句子嵌入计算跨身份余弦相似度来衡量事实一致性。

Result: 在100个身份的实验中，一致性得分范围为0.9065到0.7896，平均值为0.8656。xAI的Grok-3最一致，轻量级模型表现最差。不同话题的一致性差异明显。

Conclusion: LLM的事实一致性既受提供商影响，也受话题影响。需要开发身份无关的提示策略来提高模型的一致性表现。

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BenchPress系统，通过检索增强生成和LLMs加速创建领域特定文本到SQL基准测试，结合人工验证确保准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL研究主要关注公开数据集，但在私有企业数据仓库中效果不佳。手动标注SQL日志成本高昂，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用检索增强生成和LLMs为SQL查询生成多个自然语言描述，然后由人类专家选择、排序或编辑这些草稿。

Result: LLM辅助标注显著减少了创建高质量基准测试的时间和精力，结合人工验证提高了标注准确性、基准可靠性和模型评估鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BenchPress为研究人员和从业者提供了评估文本到SQL模型在特定领域工作负载上的机制，可免费获取。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via
our public GitHub repository at
https://github.com/fabian-wenz/enterprise-txt2sql and is also accessible on our

TL;DR: R2T框架通过将语言规则融入神经网络训练目标，在无标注文本上训练实现了98.2%的POS标注准确率，并可作为NER任务的强大预训练方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言标注数据稀缺问题，探索基于原则而非纯数据驱动的学习方法

Method: 提出Rule-to-Tag框架，在损失函数中加入正则化项处理OOV词汇，采用多层级语言规则系统

Result: 在Zarma语POS标注上达到98.2%准确率，优于在300标注句上微调的AfriBERTa；在NER任务上，R2T预训练后仅用50标注句即可超越300标注句的基线

Conclusion: R2T框架证明了原则学习范式的有效性，为低资源语言处理提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

TL;DR: CoRE是一个利用模型一致性增强LLM集成鲁棒性的即插即用技术，通过令牌级和模型级一致性处理集成中的错误信号，提升集成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同LLM具有互补能力，但集成方法对错误信号（如异构分词方案和模型能力差异）的鲁棒性关注不足，集成失败通常源于令牌级和模型级的不一致性。

Method: 提出CoRE技术：令牌级一致性使用低通滤波器降低高不一致性令牌的权重；模型级一致性通过促进高自信且与其他模型差异小的输出来增强全局一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试、模型组合和集成策略上的广泛实验表明，CoRE能持续提升集成性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoRE通过双重一致性机制有效解决了LLM集成中的鲁棒性问题，可无缝集成到各种集成方法中，显著提升集成效果。

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

Result: 在19个团队51份提交中排名第3，平均得分41.37%，在dBLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore和LLM评估指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: 轻量级RAG方法通过简单的索引和融合机制，为多模态临床NLP任务提供了一个简单有效的基线解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical

Motivation: 现有transformer模型存在显著的内存和计算开销，研究发现这些模型存在架构冗余，为优化提供了机会

Method: 基于AI可解释性和推理时层剪枝研究，利用归一化和注意力计算的线性特性，用多层感知机(MLP)近似整个transformer块

Result: 在中等上下文场景下，ShishuLM相比父模型内存需求降低25%，训练和推理延迟提升40%

Conclusion: 研究结果为从预训练角度构建更高效的小型语言模型架构提供了见解

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了首个集成LLM框架用于大规模检测辅导对话中的情感状态，分析了16,986个对话轮次，发现学生在与AI导师互动时通常呈现轻度积极情感和中等唤醒度，但学习过程并非一帆风顺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究探讨了LLM在教育环境中的学习影响，但LLM介导辅导中的情感动态仍未得到充分理解。本研究旨在通过关注学习者不断变化的情感状态，推进生成式AI在教育中负责任整合的讨论。

Method: 分析了两个学期16,986个对话轮次，使用三种前沿LLM（Gemini、GPT-4o、Claude）进行零样本情感标注，包括效价、唤醒度和学习帮助性的标量评分，以及自由文本情感标签。通过排名加权模型内池化和跨模型多数共识融合估计值。

Result: 学生通常报告轻度积极情感和中等唤醒度；困惑和好奇是解决问题的常见伴随情感；挫折感虽较少但会阻碍进展；情感状态短暂存在，积极时刻稍长但易受干扰；负面情感常快速解决，有时直接反弹为积极状态；中性时刻常作为转折点，更多引导向上而非向下。

Conclusion: 中性时刻为导师干预提供了机会窗口，情感动态的深入理解有助于设计更有效的AI辅导系统，在适当时机提供情感支持以优化学习体验。

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

Motivation: 扩散语言模型目前仍沿用自回归模型的基于前缀的提示策略，缺乏专门为其生成过程设计的条件化方法。

Method: Template Infilling (TI)：先生成目标响应的结构模板，然后填充掩码段落；Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA)：根据生成置信度自适应调整段长度。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，相比基线方法实现了17.01%的持续改进，并在多令牌生成设置中保持生成质量的同时实现有效加速。

Conclusion: TI方法为扩散语言模型提供了更灵活的结构控制能力，在多个任务上表现优异，展示了其在推理加速和生成质量方面的优势。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

Method: 为每个Attention/MLP分支配备sigmoid线性门，在推理时根据门值对token排序，使用每层预算跳过低重要性token。该方法可在预训练模型上稳定微调。

Result: 在长形式推理任务中节省高达15%计算成本，同时保持超过90%的基线准确率；在指令调优模型中，全计算时获得准确率提升，在50%节省时匹配基线质量。

Conclusion: GateSkip提供了一种稳定有效的层跳过方法，不仅节省计算成本，还揭示了transformer信息流模式（如BOS token作为锚点），并能与量化、剪枝和自推测解码等技术轻松结合。

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了LLM在多臂老虎机环境中的决策能力，发现Qwen3-4B模型在纯文本反馈下达到了89.2%的最佳臂选择率，超越了传统算法和其他LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在仅使用自然语言反馈的情况下，在不确定性环境中进行顺序决策的能力，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Method: 创建了一个纯文本反馈的多臂老虎机基准测试，让LLM仅通过"你获得了一个代币"这样的文本反馈来推断潜在奖励结构，并与传统算法进行比较。

Result: 大多数LLM表现不如基线算法，但Qwen3-4B模型表现最佳，达到了89.2%的最佳臂选择率，显著优于更大的LLM和传统方法。

Conclusion: 概率推理能力可以从纯语言中涌现，该基准测试为评估自然主义、非数值环境中的决策能力迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种让语言模型动态自主调整每个输入token计算步数的监督训练方法，模型可以通过输出<don't know>请求额外计算时间，获得<pause>标记来生成更准确的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让语言模型能够根据输入token的复杂性自适应地分配计算资源，在需要时请求更多计算时间以提高准确性。

Method: 提出了Catch Your Breath损失函数类别，包括CYB-AP（随时预测）、CYB-VA（变分方法）和CYB-DP（计算预算惩罚）三种具体方法，将输出选择建模为具有时间成本的序列决策问题。

Result: CYB模型仅需基线模型1/3的训练数据就能达到相同性能，比带暂停的交叉熵损失模型少用一半数据。模型能够根据token复杂性和上下文自适应调整处理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法使语言模型能够智能地分配计算资源，在复杂token处请求更多计算时间，在简单token处快速输出，显著提高了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Result: 在需求工程领域的概念验证中，使用分类器辅助模块成功提升了软件需求生成质量

Conclusion: PAGE提供了一种简单、模块化的架构，易于适应不同任务，无需复杂生成模型即可增强文本生成

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

TL;DR: 本文主张在LLM社会模拟中采用开放式文本生成方法，而非局限于多项选择或简答格式，以更真实地模拟社会现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM社会模拟研究大多采用封闭式设计，忽视了LLM的生成特性，无法真实反映社会观点的多样性和复杂性。

Method: 基于调查方法学和NLP最新进展，提出开放式文本生成框架，捕捉主题、观点和推理过程。

Result: 开放式方法能改善测量和设计、探索意外观点、减少研究者偏见、捕捉表达性和个体性、辅助预测试。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发新的实践和评估框架，充分利用LLM的开放式生成多样性，促进NLP与社会科学的协同发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

<details>

Motivation: 评估当代大语言模型在非结构化文本分类任务中的实际表现，了解其局限性和改进方向。

Method: 使用8,660个人工标注样本和统一的零样本提示，评估10个LLMs在IAB 2.2层次分类法上的表现，采用经典指标和LLM特定指标。

Result: LLMs平均准确率34%，存在高幻觉率和膨胀率。集成方法显著提升准确率，完全消除幻觉。

Conclusion: 模型协调比单纯扩展规模更有效，集成方法是实现超越人类专家性能的有效途径。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

Motivation: 当前LLM在数学推理方面的进展主要关注可验证的最终答案，但生成和验证自然语言数学证明仍是一个开放挑战，缺乏可靠的细粒度评估器是关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出了系统化的评估器开发方法，引入ProofBench专家标注数据集，探索评估器设计空间（骨干模型、输入上下文、指令和工作流程），最终开发出结合强推理骨干模型、参考解和评分方案的ProofGrader。

Result: ProofGrader在专家评分上达到0.926的MAE，在最佳选择任务中平均得分4.14（满分7），弥补了朴素二元评估器（2.48）与人类专家（4.62）之间78%的差距。

Conclusion: ProofGrader证明了其在细粒度数学证明评估方面的有效性，有潜力推动下游证明生成任务的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but
face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and
reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), compact, efficient, and

frameworks that fuse SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs'
generalization and reasoning to meet diverse objectives across tasks and
deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a

objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement,
cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and

Motivation: 现有方法在高质量监督微调数据选择过程中过度依赖LLM内部知识、可解释性差且泛化能力有限，需要解决这些局限性。

Method: 提出THTB框架，结合质量过滤与内在和外在难度评分，优先选择高级认知指令，为高效SFT提供可解释和可量化的标准。

Result: 实验显示THTB仅用5%数据训练的模型就能超越全数据集训练，在垂直领域仅用2%数据就能超越更大数据集训练的模型，表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: THTB在数据选择和标注指导方面都表现出色，为领域适应提供了强大潜力，代码、数据集和模型已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to
specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.
Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce
training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from
over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited
generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The
Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection
and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions
by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring,
offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in
data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables
models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,
while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In
addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,
enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on
much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our
code, datasets, and models are available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要关注单轮攻击，缺乏跨语言覆盖，且分类法有限，无法捕捉攻击策略的多样性或过于强调风险类别而非越狱技术本身。

Method: 通过结构化红队挑战，开发了包含7个主要家族的50种越狱策略的层次化分类法，分析了挑战收集的数据，评估了基于分类法的提示方法，并创建了多轮对抗对话数据集。

Result: 建立了全面的越狱策略分类法，揭示了不同攻击策略如何利用模型漏洞并导致错位，证明了分类法引导的提示能改进自动检测，并提供了意大利语多轮对抗对话数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了对越狱技术有效性的理解，提供了系统化的分类框架和数据集，有助于改进大语言模型的安全防御机制。

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的文本质量接近人类写作，作者归属变得越来越具有挑战性。本研究旨在评估和比较两种互补的作者归属机制，为AI生成内容的归属问题提供可复现的基准。

Method: 使用人类AI平行语料库（包含6个领域的600个平衡实例），每个实例包含人类提示、黄金续写和LLM生成的续写（来自GPT-4o或LLaMA-70B-Instruct）。比较了固定风格嵌入和指令调优的LLM法官（GPT-4o）两种归属方法。

Result: 风格嵌入在GPT续写上的总体准确率更高（82% vs 68%），LLM法官在LLaMA续写上略有优势（85% vs 81%），但统计上不显著。LLM法官在小说和学术散文上表现显著更好，而风格嵌入在口语和剧本对话中占优势。

Conclusion: 作者归属是一个多维问题，需要混合策略。两种方法在不同领域各有优势，表明需要根据文本类型选择合适的归属方法。研究提供了开源框架和可复现基准，支持AI生成内容归属质量评估。

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is
increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We
benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and
an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an
open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news,
fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance
contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated
continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on
GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open
framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment
in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing

Motivation: 研究窄域微调如何影响LLM的激活模式，以及这些偏差如何揭示微调领域的信息，为AI安全和可解释性研究提供见解。

Method: 使用模型差异分析工具，比较微调前后模型的激活差异，特别是在随机文本前几个token上的差异，并通过添加这些差异来引导文本生成。

Result: 发现窄域微调在LLM激活中产生显著偏差，这些偏差包含微调领域的关键信息。基于这些偏差构建的LLM可解释性代理性能显著优于简单提示的基线代理。

Conclusion: 窄域微调模型在其激活中保留了训练目标的明显痕迹，这对AI安全和可解释性研究具有重要意义，表明使用此类模型作为更广泛微调研究的代理可能不现实。

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

TL;DR: RAID是一个针对大语言模型的越狱攻击框架，通过优化连续嵌入空间中的对抗性后缀来绕过安全机制，结合拒绝感知正则化和连贯性约束，在保持语义合理性的同时提高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在各种任务上表现出色，但容易受到越狱攻击，绕过其安全机制。现有方法在攻击效果和效率方面存在不足，需要更系统的方法来探测这些弱点。

Method: RAID将离散令牌松弛为连续嵌入，通过联合目标优化：(1)鼓励受限响应；(2)拒绝感知正则化，将激活引导远离嵌入空间中的拒绝方向；(3)连贯性约束保持语义合理性和非冗余性。优化后使用批评指导的解码过程将嵌入映射回令牌。

Result: 在多个开源LLM上的实验表明，RAID相比现有的白盒和黑盒基线方法，以更少的查询和更低的计算成本实现了更高的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了嵌入空间正则化对于理解和缓解LLM越狱漏洞的重要性，RAID框架为系统探测模型弱点提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse
tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms.
We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了大型语言模型在道德和政治领域的潜在偏见，使用道德基础理论框架比较LLM响应与人类数据，评估模型是否表现出意识形态倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在日常生活中的广泛应用，特别是在医疗、人际关系和法律等关键领域作为建议提供者，需要了解这些模型在政治和道德领域的响应是否存在偏见。

Method: 使用道德基础理论框架，分析LLM的响应与现有人类研究数据的差异，评估模型在固有响应、明确政治意识形态表示和基于人口统计的角色扮演中的表现。

Result: 研究发现LLM的响应确实存在意识形态倾向，无论是固有响应还是通过角色扮演生成的响应都显示出政治和人口统计依赖性。

Conclusion: LLM在道德和政治领域的响应具有明显的意识形态倾向，这为理解AI生成内容的政治和人口统计依赖性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL)框架，通过从示例中提取认知构建块的抽象模式来增强语言模型的推理过程，显著提升性能并减少对演示数量的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统示例驱动的上下文学习缺乏在抽象层面进行知识检索和迁移的显式模块，受认知科学中图式理论启发，旨在为语言模型提供类似人类心智框架的结构化推理支持。

Method: 从先验示例中提取推理过程的认知构建块表示，创建轻量级、结构化的抽象模式模板，包含关键推理步骤及其关系，用于增强模型面对新问题时的推理过程。

Result: 在GPQA数据集的化学和物理问题上，SA-ICL一致提升性能，最高达36.19%，特别是在高质量单演示示例时效果显著，同时减少对演示数量的依赖并增强可解释性。

Conclusion: SA-ICL不仅连接了从模式启动到思维链提示的各种ICL策略，还为增强语言模型类人推理能力开辟了新路径，证明显式模式支架对语言模型学习表示的重要性。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Duel Optimizer (PDO)，一种无需标签的提示优化框架，通过双人赌博机设置和LLM法官的成对偏好反馈来高效优化提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法需要真实标签数据，但高质量标签收集成本高且缓慢，需要开发无需标签的优化方法。

Method: PDO将问题建模为双人赌博机设置，结合Double Thompson Sampling和Top-Performer Guided Mutation，通过LLM法官的成对偏好反馈进行优化。

Result: 在BIG-bench Hard和MS MARCO上的实验表明，PDO持续优于基线方法，消融研究验证了D-TS和提示变异的有效性。

Conclusion: PDO提供了一种样本高效的无需标签提示优化框架，能够有效处理法官噪声，并在各种任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析LLaMA 3.2-3B模型的内部表示，发现大语言模型在残差流中编码了算术运算符优先级，特别是在MLP块之后，并提出了部分嵌入交换技术来修改运算符优先级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在推理任务上表现出色，但在算术计算方面仍有困难。现有研究主要关注输出或提示策略，而缺乏对模型内部算术计算结构的研究。

Method: 构建包含三个操作数和两个运算符的算术表达式数据集，使用logit lens、线性分类探针和UMAP几何可视化等可解释性技术，分析LLaMA 3.2-3B模型的残差流，并引入部分嵌入交换技术。

Result: 发现中间计算结果出现在残差流中，特别是在MLP块之后；模型在注意力层后线性编码了每个运算符的优先级。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在内部表示中确实编码了运算符优先级，这为理解模型算术计算机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了KRLM模型来解决归纳知识图谱推理中的LLM知识扭曲和生成幻觉问题，通过知识推理语言指令格式、KRL注意力层和结构感知实体预测器实现LLM知识与KG上下文的有效协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的知识图谱基础模型在处理开放域知识图谱时，LLM的内在知识容易被稀疏的KG上下文所掩盖，导致知识扭曲和生成幻觉，严重影响推理结果的可信度。

Method: 设计知识推理语言指令格式和KRL分词器对齐LLM知识与KG表示；提出KRL注意力层通过动态知识记忆机制协调LLM内在知识与额外KG上下文；构建结构感知下一实体预测器严格约束推理结果在可信知识域内。

Result: 在25个真实世界归纳知识图谱推理数据集上的实验结果表明，KRLM在零样本推理和微调场景下均表现出显著优越性。

Conclusion: KRLM通过统一协调LLM知识与KG上下文，有效解决了知识扭曲和生成幻觉问题，显著提升了归纳知识图谱推理的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot
reasoning and fine-tuning scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RAGCap-Bench基准，用于细粒度评估代理式RAG工作流中的中间任务能力，发现具有更强中间能力表现的模型能获得更好的端到端结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理式RAG系统在处理复杂多跳问题时仍存在困难，且其中间推理能力研究不足，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 分析最先进系统的输出以识别常见任务和所需核心能力，构建典型LLM错误分类法，设计针对性评估问题。

Result: 实验表明具有更强RAGCap性能的"慢思考"模型能获得更好的端到端结果，验证了基准的有效性。

Conclusion: 增强中间能力对提升代理式RAG系统性能至关重要，RAGCap-Bench为评估和改进这些能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large
Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work
extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to
iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these
systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their
intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we
propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained
evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs
from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core
capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical
LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that
"slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better
end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of
enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究将AI辩论应用于主观问题，发现LLM倾向于迎合法官立场而非坚持自身先验信念，顺序辩论存在显著偏见，模型在辩护与自身信念一致的立场时更具说服力，但反直觉的是，与信念不符的论点在成对比较中被评为更高质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有辩论实验依赖有真实答案的数据集，忽略了说谎的主观维度——说谎需要相信所辩护的主张是错误的。本研究旨在测试LLM在主观问题辩论中是否会采用迎合策略，还是忠实于自身先验信念。

Method: 测量LLM的先验信念，然后让辩手在法官立场与自身信念冲突的情况下进行辩论，比较顺序和同时两种辩论协议，评估模型在辩护与自身信念一致vs不一致立场时的说服力和论点质量。

Result: 模型倾向于选择与法官立场一致的立场而非自身信念；顺序辩论对第二位辩手存在显著偏见；模型在辩护与自身信念一致的立场时更具说服力；但反直觉的是，与信念不符的论点在成对比较中被评为更高质量。

Conclusion: 这些结果可以帮助人类法官提供更高质量的训练信号，促进更对齐的AI系统发展，同时揭示了语言模型中说服动态的重要方面。

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成更高质量的训练数据，有效提升网络智能体的长时程推理能力，同时保持更好的工具使用多样性。

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳当前认为可读性（如儿童导向语料）对小语言模型能力发展至关重要的观点，质疑将语言模型训练与人类认知发展进行类比的做法

Method: 构建结构匹配但可读性不同的合成数据集，比较小语言模型在不同可读性语料上的表现和学习效率

Result: 模型在复杂成人文本上的表现与简化语言相当，甚至更快发展出连贯性；统计简单性（n-元多样性）是更强的学习能力预测指标

Conclusion: 应避免将语言模型训练过度拟人化，需要更精确地理解支持小模型能力涌现的实际属性，而非简单类比人类认知发展

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

<details>

Motivation: 化学元素属性数据对材料设计至关重要，但许多属性难以直接测量。传统数值分析方法无法建模复杂关系，而现有AI方法存在幻觉和缺乏可解释性问题。

Method: 使用语言模型从维基百科文本生成全局通用嵌入和局部属性突出向量，并设计基于自注意力的测试时训练方法来缓解预测误差。

Result: 成功开发了Element2Vec方法，能够有效表示化学元素，支持自然科学研究。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进材料科学中AI驱动发现铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for
specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design
a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction
error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the
way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

Motivation: 现有PRM在测试时扩展中表现不稳定，有时甚至被简单多数投票超越，需要更有效地利用PRM验证信号。

Method: 开发理论框架分析LLM和PRM信号的最优组合策略，提出高效的预计算权重校准方法。

Result: 在5个LLM和7个PRM上的实验表明，校准方法显著提升TTS效率，仅用21.3%计算量就超越传统加权投票。

Conclusion: 投资更智能的聚合策略比单纯扩展测试时计算更能获得性能提升，为PRM的有效使用提供了新路径。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

TL;DR: FACTS是一种快速、准确且隐私合规的表格摘要方法，通过离线模板生成实现查询聚焦的表格摘要，避免了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格摘要方法存在多个问题：表格到文本模型需要昂贵微调且难以处理复杂推理；基于提示的LLM方法有token限制和效率问题且暴露敏感数据；现有代理流程依赖分解、规划或手动模板，缺乏鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: FACTS采用代理工作流，生成包含SQL查询和Jinja2模板的离线模板，这些模板可在共享相同模式的多个表格中重复使用，通过渲染生成自然语言摘要。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，FACTS始终优于基线方法，证明了其作为实际查询聚焦表格摘要解决方案的有效性。

Conclusion: FACTS通过可重用的离线模板实现快速摘要，通过可执行的SQL查询确保准确性，并通过仅向LLM发送表格模式来保证隐私合规，是现实世界查询聚焦表格摘要的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table
schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS
consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical
solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

Result: 在多个物联网捕获数据和六个开放模型上的实验评估显示，混合检索相比纯密集检索显著提升了BLEU、ROUGE、METEOR和BERTScore结果，系统分析表明CPU、GPU和内存开销较低。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了对物联网网络流量的全面高效解释，证明了混合检索方法在提升分析准确性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic
that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful
insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors,
protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an
LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into
structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis.
The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly
detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and
retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language
model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling
evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental
evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid
retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,
substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with
dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and
memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and
efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在一般推理任务中表现良好，但在生物医学领域生成的内容往往缺乏科学严谨性，无法访问权威生物医学数据库，经常虚构蛋白质功能、相互作用和结构细节。

Method: 通过子查询分解、关键词提取、任务图构建和多源信息过滤，BioMedSearch整合文献检索、蛋白质数据库和网络搜索，生成高质量问答结果。

Result: 在构建的BioMedMCQs数据集（3000个问题）上，BioMedSearch在所有推理级别上都显著提高了准确率：Level 1从59.1%提升到91.9%，Level 2从47.0%提升到81.0%，Level 3从36.3%提升到73.4%。

Conclusion: BioMedSearch能够持续提升所有基线模型在各个级别的准确率，为复杂生物医学问答任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized
knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of
diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and
effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support
accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform
well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks
scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical
databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and
structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we
present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework
based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and
web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex
biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,
task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch
generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of
question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,
consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning:
mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal
causal reasoning, and is used to assess the performance of BioMedSearch and
other methods on complex QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all
levels. Specifically, at Level 1, the average accuracy increases from 59.1% to
91.9%; at Level 2, it rises from 47.0% to 81.0%; and at the most challenging
Level 3, the average accuracy improves from 36.3% to 73.4%. The code and

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 探索LLMs在药物安全预测中是否纳入临床无关的社会人口学信息，评估其在真实世界部署场景中的可靠性。

Method: 使用FDA不良事件报告系统数据，基于人物角色评估框架，测试ChatGPT-4o和Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B在不同教育、就业、保险等社会属性下的表现。

Result: 发现系统性预测差异，弱势群体被分配更高的不良事件预测概率，识别出显性偏见和隐性偏见两种模式。

Conclusion: LLMs在药物警戒应用中存在严重偏见风险，迫切需要公平性评估协议和缓解策略才能进行临床部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 通过指令检索而非生成的方式，为小型语言模型提供结构化推理指导，在医学、法律和数学问答任务上实现显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型虽然能在本地硬件上高效运行，具有隐私保护、低成本等优势，但在需要多步推理或领域知识的任务上表现不佳

Method: 构建指令语料库，对相似训练问题进行分组并通过GPT-5生成指令。推理时，SLM检索最相关指令并遵循其步骤，提供结构化推理指导

Result: 在MedQA、MMLU专业法律和MathQA任务上，指令检索带来一致性能提升：MedQA提升9.4%，MMLU法律提升7.9%，MathQA提升5.1%

Conclusion: 简洁指令优于冗长指令，改进幅度强烈依赖于模型系列和内在推理能力，指令检索是提升小型语言模型推理能力的有效方法

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting
complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and
systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis.
To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework
with a hierarchical analytical structure and a fine-grained grading rubric for
rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis.
This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from
data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization
and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch
benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4
languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct
extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods,
including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search
capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results
reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse
capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for
future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过微调AI模型可以显著提升模仿作者风格的能力，专家和普通读者都更偏好微调后的AI生成文本，而非专家人类写作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI模型是否能够高质量模仿获奖作者的文学风格，以及不同训练方法对生成文本质量的影响，为版权争议提供实证依据。

Method: 采用预注册研究，比较MFA训练的专业作家与ChatGPT、Claude、Gemini三种前沿AI模型，通过上下文提示和微调两种方法生成450字文本片段，由159名专家和普通读者进行盲审评估。

Result: 上下文提示的AI文本在风格保真度和写作质量上被专家强烈否定，但微调后完全逆转：专家更偏好AI生成文本，且AI检测器很少能识别微调输出。微调成本仅为每作者81美元，比专业作家报酬降低99.7%。

Conclusion: 作者特定的微调使AI能够生成读者偏好的非逐字文本，这直接关系到版权法中"对潜在市场或价值影响"的公平使用因素。

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

<details>

Motivation: 发现推理不确定性高度局部化，只有少量高熵token主导输出正确性，而现有方法通常需要大量推理计算

Method: MTI包含：选择性CFG干预（仅对不确定位置应用分类器自由引导）和轻量级负提示引导（重用主模型KV缓存高效近似无条件解码）

Result: 在通用、编程和STEM任务上获得一致提升，如Qwen3-8B-Base在8个基准上平均提升1.35%，Qwen3-32B-Reasoning在AIME2024上提升5%

Conclusion: MTI是一种无需训练的方法，能以最小开销显著提升推理准确性和稳定性

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

Conclusion: 该工作为RAG系统的错误分析和改进提供了系统化的框架和实用工具，有助于提高RAG系统的稳健性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building
LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external
knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are
many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice
to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 大规模语言模型开发依赖大规模训练语料，但大多数语料许可状态不明确，限制了真正开放模型的发展。德语等非英语语言的公开许可文本尤其稀缺。

Method: 从41个数据源系统收集数据，实施全面的质量过滤、去重和文本格式修复处理流程，确保异构文本源的质量一致性。

Result: 构建了154.56亿token的高质量德语文本集合，所有子集至少具有CC-BY-SA 4.0或等效许可，确保模型训练和再分发的法律合规性。

Conclusion: German Commons填补了公开许可德语预训练数据的关键空白，使真正开放的德语语言模型开发成为可能，并发布了可复现和可扩展的语料构建代码。

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正确回答不一定反映文化理解，需要评估LLMs如何在跨文化背景下进行推理，而不仅仅是答案的准确性。

Method: 引入CRaFT框架，使用文化流利度、偏差度、一致性和语言适应性四个指标，在阿拉伯语、孟加拉语和西班牙语中评估三个模型对50个文化相关问题的回答解释。

Result: 结果显示显著的跨语言推理差异：阿拉伯语降低流利度，孟加拉语增强流利度，西班牙语保持稳定。GPT跨语言适应更好但一致性较低，FANAR推理稳定但僵化。

Conclusion: LLMs的文化意识不是固有的，而是通过语言框架显现。CRaFT为多语言环境中的跨文化推理评估提供了新视角，为构建文化适应性语言模型提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We
introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework
designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural
contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates
model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency,
Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50
culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into
Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and
FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant
cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances
it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively
across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid
reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not
intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for
evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing
actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

Conclusion: 大语言模型在抽象推理任务中存在语言偏见，英语模态优势明显，模型类型也会影响性能表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic
relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many
specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest
themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously
identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional
approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

Motivation: 大语言模型在多轮对话中，当信息逐步呈现时会出现显著的性能下降，这限制了其在实际应用中的可用性。

Method: 提出ERGO方法，通过持续量化下一个token分布的香农熵来检测不确定性激增，并触发自适应的提示整合来重新对齐对话上下文。

Result: 在增量指令任务中，ERGO相比标准基线平均性能提升56.6%，峰值性能提升24.7%，不可靠性降低35.3%。

Conclusion: 将不确定性作为首要信号而非需要消除的干扰，能够同时提升对话AI的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases
aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability
(variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware
interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for
OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These
results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration
can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue
systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming everyday applications, yet
deployment in cybersecurity lags due to a lack of high-quality, domain-specific
models and training datasets. To address this gap, we present CyberPal 2.0, a
family of cybersecurity-expert small language models (SLMs) ranging from 4B-20B
parameters. To train CyberPal 2.0, we generate an enriched chain-of-thought
cybersecurity instruction dataset built with our data enrichment and formatting
pipeline, SecKnowledge 2.0, which integrates expert-in-the-loop steering of
reasoning formats alongside LLM-driven multi-step grounding, yielding
higher-fidelity, task-grounded reasoning traces for security tasks. Across
diverse cybersecurity benchmarks, CyberPal 2.0 consistently outperforms its
baselines and matches or surpasses various open and closed-source frontier
models, while remaining a fraction of their size. On core cyber threat
intelligence knowledge tasks, our models outperform almost all tested frontier

tasks, such as correlating vulnerabilities and bug tickets with weaknesses, our
best 20B-parameter model outperforms GPT-4o, o1, o3-mini, and Sec-Gemini v1,
ranking first, while our smallest 4B-parameter model ranks second.

*Zhichao Wang,Andy Wong,Ruslan Belkin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出RLSR方法替代SFT，通过强化学习框架利用SFT数据集提升基础模型的指令跟随能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于传统SFT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受RFT启发，作者希望利用强化学习框架来充分利用SFT数据集，从而更有效地提升基础模型的指令跟随能力，避免传统SFT方法仅依赖下一词预测目标的局限性。

Method: RLSR方法中，基础模型为每个提示生成多个响应，然后计算生成响应与人工标注响应在语义嵌入空间中的余弦相似度作为奖励分数，在强化学习框架中进行训练。

Result: RLSR在指令跟随基准测试中表现优于SFT：Qwen-7B模型使用RLSR在AlpacaEval上获得26.34%胜率，而SFT仅为21.01%。结合SFT和RLSR进一步提升至30.73%胜率。

Conclusion: RLSR可以有效替代或补充SFT，通过强化学习框架更好地利用SFT数据集，显著提升模型的指令跟随能力，为模型微调提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved
a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

TL;DR: 提出了动态角色精炼框架(DPRF)，通过迭代识别认知差异并优化角色配置，提升大语言模型角色扮演代理与目标个体行为的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型角色扮演代理的角色保真度常因手动创建的角色配置（如精选信息和个性特征）而受损，缺乏与目标个体一致性的验证。

Method: DPRF通过自由形式或理论基础的认知差异分析，迭代识别生成行为与人类真实行为之间的差异，并优化角色配置以减少这些差异。

Result: 在四种不同行为预测场景（正式辩论、社交媒体心理健康帖子、公开采访和影评）上评估，DPRF能显著提升行为一致性，并在不同模型和场景中具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了创建高保真角色配置的稳健方法，增强了用户模拟、社会研究和个性化AI等下游应用的有效性。

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

TL;DR: LiteStage是一个针对多阶段推理的延迟感知层跳过框架，通过阶段式离线搜索分配最优层预算，结合在线置信度生成早期退出机制，在保持准确性的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段推理虽然能提升小语言模型的推理能力，但带来了显著的延迟增加。现有自适应加速技术（如层跳过）难以在效率和准确性之间取得平衡，主要面临两个挑战：阶段间跳过敏感度差异和冗余输出令牌生成。

Method: 提出LiteStage框架，结合阶段式离线搜索（为每个阶段分配最优层预算）和在线置信度生成早期退出机制（抑制不必要的解码）。

Result: 在OBQA、CSQA和StrategyQA三个基准测试中，LiteStage实现了最高1.70倍的加速，准确率损失小于4.0%，优于先前的免训练层跳过方法。

Conclusion: LiteStage通过智能的层预算分配和早期退出机制，有效解决了多阶段推理中的效率-准确性权衡问题，为小语言模型的高效推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

TL;DR: 提出Flip-Flop Consistency (F²C)无监督训练方法，通过共识交叉熵和表示对齐损失来提高LLM对提示扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在面对相同提示的不同表述时经常产生不一致的答案，需要提高模型对提示扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: F²C包含两个关键组件：共识交叉熵（使用多数投票创建硬伪标签）和表示对齐损失（将低置信度预测器向共识对齐）。

Result: 在11个数据集上评估，平均提高一致性11.62%，提升F1分数8.94%，减少性能方差3.29%。在域外评估中也表现良好。

Conclusion: F²C是增强LLM一致性、性能和泛化能力的有效无监督方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

TL;DR: MoM框架将RAG从被动分块转变为主动理解，通过模拟人类阅读认知过程提取文档记忆，使用多路径采样和多视角评估机制选择最优记忆，并融入反向推理策略训练小型语言模型，实现跨领域的智能文本处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG范式在理解相关文本块时存在知识内化深度和推理能力的限制，需要从被动分块转向主动理解，模拟人类阅读认知过程。

Method: 提出MoM框架：1）使用LLM模拟领域专家生成文档逻辑大纲，指导结构化分块和核心内容提取；2）多路径采样和多视角评估机制选择最优文档记忆；3）融入反向推理策略训练SLMs；4）开发三层文档记忆检索机制。

Result: 在三个不同领域的广泛实验结果表明，MoM框架不仅解决了现有RAG系统的文本分块挑战，为LLMs提供语义完整的文档记忆，还为SLMs实现以人为中心的智能文本处理铺平了道路。

Conclusion: MoM框架通过主动文档记忆提取和人类认知模拟，显著提升了RAG系统的知识内化和推理能力，为小型语言模型实现智能文本处理提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

Motivation: 研究训练数据如何影响语言模型行为，特别是事实知识获取，补充过去基于共现统计的观察性分析。

Method: 通过"重写历史"的方式干预数据批次，包括选择评估基准、匹配相关文档、修改文档、重新训练模型并测量效果。

Result: 现有识别相关训练文档的方法不能完全解释语言模型正确回答知识问题的能力，但补充了共现统计与模型行为的关联分析。

Conclusion: 提供了一个可复用的实验方法框架，供研究人员进一步测试训练数据如何影响模型行为的假设。

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

Motivation: 现有的图检索增强生成系统依赖LLM自动构建知识图谱，但会产生包含冗余实体和不可靠关系的噪声图谱，这会降低检索和生成性能并增加计算成本。

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅大幅减小图谱规模，还在多种流行的图检索增强生成变体上一致提升了问答性能。

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面探索了LLM生成知识图谱中的实体解析问题，证明了简单的去噪方法能显著改善图检索增强生成系统的效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

Method: 分析影响多语言嵌入效果的关键因素：训练数据规模、负采样策略和数据多样性，特别关注硬负样本和任务多样性的作用。

Result: 发现增加训练数据规模初期有效但收益递减，硬负样本对提升检索准确率至关重要，任务多样性比语言多样性对性能贡献更大。最终开发出300M参数的紧凑模型。

Conclusion: 小型多语言模型可以通过针对性优化（特别是硬负样本和任务多样性）在检索任务中达到甚至超越大型模型的性能，为高效多语言检索提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全护栏模型存在两大局限：只能输出二元安全标签，无法适应不同领域的安全容忍度；需要完整模型输出才能进行安全检查，无法与流式推理兼容，导致无法及时干预有害内容生成。

Method: 开发了两种专用变体：生成式Qwen3Guard将安全分类转化为指令跟随任务，实现细粒度三分类；流式Qwen3Guard引入token级分类头，支持实时安全监控。提供0.6B、4B和8B三种规模，支持119种语言。

Result: 在英语、中文和多语言基准测试中，Qwen3Guard在提示和响应安全分类方面实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard为全球LLM部署提供了全面、可扩展和低延迟的安全调节解决方案，所有模型均以Apache 2.0许可证公开发布。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要收集多个证据片段，传统检索方法在精度和召回率方面存在不足，需要更智能的检索系统来支持复杂问题的回答。

Method: 使用三个专门代理：问题分析器分解问题为子问题，选择器为每个子问题选择最相关上下文（侧重精度），加法器补充缺失证据（侧重召回率），通过选择器和加法器的迭代交互获得紧凑而全面的支持段落。

Result: 在四个多跳问答基准测试（HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA、MuSiQue、MultiHopRAG）上持续优于强基线方法，实现更高检索精度同时过滤干扰内容。

Conclusion: 该智能检索系统能够显著提升下游问答模型的准确性，同时减少对无关信息的依赖，为多跳问答任务提供了有效的检索解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文感知的双向模式检索框架，将模式链接作为独立问题处理，显著提升Text-to-SQL系统的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模式链接是Text-to-SQL系统中关键但未被充分探索的组件，现有方法主要关注SQL生成而忽视相关模式元素的检索，导致幻觉和执行失败。

Method: 采用双向模式检索框架，结合表优先检索后列选择和列优先检索后表选择两种互补策略，并辅以问题分解、关键词提取和关键短语提取技术。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider等挑战性基准测试中，该方法显著提高模式召回率并减少误报，SQL生成性能持续优于全模式基线，接近oracle性能，无需查询优化。

Conclusion: 模式链接是提升Text-to-SQL准确性和效率的有力杠杆，该方法将完整模式和完美模式设置之间的性能差距缩小了50%。

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full

Motivation: 学术出版物快速增长给论文分析带来挑战，现有论文数据库大多局限于相似性匹配和基本分类，无法深入探索概念间的关系网络。

Method: 基于OpenAlex开源知识图谱，分析近8000篇开源论文数据，提出基于提示工程的关键概念路径分析方法，利用小语言模型进行概念提取和创新点识别，构建基于知识图谱约束机制的分析代理。

Result: 通过微调Qwen和DeepSeek模型，在准确性方面取得了显著提升，模型已在Hugging Face平台公开可用。

Conclusion: 论文关键概念路径的分布模式与创新点和稀有路径存在强相关性，提出的方法能够有效提升学术论文分析的深度和准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注英语或少数高资源语言，缺乏对多语言和跨语言数学推理能力的评估

Method: 构建包含7种语言的平行多语言基准，系统评估开源和专有LLM在零样本、思维链和代码切换推理范式下的表现

Result: LLM在不同语言间的数学推理能力存在显著差异，在低资源语言环境中表现明显下降

Conclusion: 需要开发更强大的多语言数学推理模型，特别是在低资源语言环境中

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent
and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced
degradation in low-resource settings. All the codes and data are available at

*Marwa Abdulhai,Ryan Cheng,Aryansh Shrivastava,Natasha Jaques,Yarin Gal,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在对话中的欺骗行为，提出了信念错位指标来量化欺骗，发现LLMs在约26%的对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗行为，RLHF训练模型仍有43%的欺骗率，并提出多轮强化学习方法将欺骗行为减少了77.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在客服、教育、医疗等应用中与数百万人互动，但其产生欺骗性输出的能力（无论是有意还是无意）带来了严重的安全隐患。LLM行为的不可预测性，加上对幻觉、错误信息和用户操纵的防护不足，使其滥用成为严重的现实风险。

Method: 提出信念错位指标来量化欺骗，在四种不同对话场景中评估欺骗行为，使用五种已有的欺骗检测指标和新提出的指标。引入多轮强化学习方法来微调LLMs以减少欺骗行为。

Result: 新提出的欺骗度量与人类判断的相关性比现有指标更紧密。LLMs在约26%的对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗行为，当被提示欺骗时，欺骗性相对基线可增加31%。RLHF训练模型的欺骗率平均为43%。多轮强化学习方法将欺骗行为减少了77.6%。

Conclusion: 对话中的欺骗行为是在交互历史中发展的，其有效评估和缓解需要超越单轮话语分析。提出的多轮强化学习方法能显著减少LLMs的欺骗行为，为解决这一重要安全问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

TL;DR: 开发了一种使用混合词嵌入和微调超参数的鲁棒分类方法，用于阿尔茨海默病的早期检测，达到91%的分类准确率和97%的AUC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的早期检测对患者有益，可以及早治疗减轻症状并降低医疗负担。语言能力变化是AD的主要迹象之一，可用于早期诊断。

Method: 创建基于Doc2Vec和ELMo词向量的混合词嵌入来获取句子困惑度分数，添加语言特征分析语法和语义，将嵌入特征向量输入逻辑回归并微调整个管道的超参数。

Result: 达到91%的分类准确率和97%的AUC，在区分早期AD与健康受试者方面优于现有最佳NLP模型（准确率88%）。模型稳定性良好（准确率标准差0.0403，AUC标准差0.0174）。

Conclusion: 该方法准确且稳定，可用作AD的大规模筛查方法，也可作为医生检测AD的补充检查。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

Motivation: 现有LLM在角色扮演中难以忠实、一致地表现特定版本的角色特征，特别是在拥有多个版本的超级英雄角色中。

Method: 构建包含30个英雄角色90个版本的基准测试，包含两个任务：经典事件（事实回忆）和道德困境（伦理场景）。提出Think-Act Matching指标评估推理与行动的一致性。

Result: 实验发现：思维链提示在弱模型中提升叙事连贯性但在强模型中降低准确性；跨版本泛化仍是主要障碍；模型通常擅长思考或行动但很少两者兼备。

Conclusion: Beyond One World揭示了多宇宙一致性和推理对齐方面的关键差距，为角色扮演LLM提供了具有挑战性的评估标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能医学大模型通常需要大量计算资源进行微调，限制了资源受限医疗机构的可及性。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：置信度检测模块评估主模型确定性，自适应路由机制将低置信度查询导向具有互补知识的辅助模型进行协作推理。

Result: 在PubMedQA上达到95.0%，MedMCQA上达到78.0%的优异表现，显著优于单模型方法和统一推理策略。

Conclusion: 战略性模型合作为改进医学AI系统提供了实用且计算高效的途径，对资源受限环境中的医学AI民主化具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Motivation: 研究LLMs对结构化字符级扰动的抵抗能力，特别是在防止LLM滥用的应用场景中。

Method: 引入\nameshort{}方法，在文本中插入不可见Unicode控制字符，通过破坏分词和降低信噪比来测试LLMs的鲁棒性。

Result: 尽管存在强烈的混淆效果，许多LLMs仍能保持显著性能，表现出对字符级噪声的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLMs在字符级具有低层次鲁棒性，这既揭示了其滥用的风险，也反映了在不同应用中部署LLMs的可靠性问题。

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent
and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the
insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national
warning system that reaches all Americans.

Motivation: 现有问答系统在处理需要跨所有文档聚合信息的现实问题时存在局限，特别是在重复性高、干扰文档多的语料库中表现不佳。

Method: 提出PluriHopRAG方法：将查询分解为文档级子问题，使用交叉编码器过滤无关文档，再进行LLM推理。

Result: PluriHopRAG在F1分数上相对提升了18-52%，而传统方法最高不超过40%。

Conclusion: PluriHopWIND暴露了当前QA系统在重复性语料库中的局限性，PluriHopRAG证明了全面检索和早期过滤的价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

Method: 构建了基于Reddit的高质量标注数据集，包含用户发帖历史和评论，采用基于C-SSRS的四标签标注框架，并进行统计分析和大型语言模型实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，整合评论树数据能显著增强用户自杀风险水平的区分和预测能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升高危个体检测准确性提供了新视角，为早期自杀干预策略奠定了宝贵基础。

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

Motivation: 大语言模型擅长通用下一个标记预测，但难以生成反映个人真实沟通风格（如回复邮件或社交消息）的响应。真实社交媒体或邮件历史因隐私问题难以收集。

Method: 构建包含英语、日语和中文的100个对话会话的多语言基准，用户与基于MBTI维度的心理基础NPC进行五天互动，捕捉自然日常沟通模式。评估基于提示和微调的个性化方法。

Result: 建立了首个YNTP基准，为面向用户的语言建模奠定了基础。数据集已公开可用。

Conclusion: YNTP任务能够有效建模用户的精确用词选择，为解决个性化语言生成提供了新的方法和评估框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still
struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,
such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real
SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To
address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which
models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent
conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions
across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with
psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures
natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'
internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization
methods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for
user-aligned language modeling. The dataset is available at:

Conclusion: MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG框架能有效增强医疗问答的事实一致性，显著减少幻觉现象，在多种模型架构上均表现优异。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of
complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需外部监督的自监督强化学习框架，通过从指令直接推导奖励信号并生成伪标签来解决多约束指令遵循问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在处理多约束指令时表现不佳，现有强化学习方法依赖外部监督且面临稀疏奖励问题

Method: 采用约束分解策略和高效的约束级二元分类，直接从指令推导奖励信号并生成伪标签进行奖励模型训练

Result: 在3个领域内和5个领域外数据集上均取得显著改进，包括具有挑战性的代理和多轮指令遵循任务

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决多约束指令遵循问题，具有良好的泛化能力，且计算效率高

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that
are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward
signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL
framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward
signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain
and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn
instruction following. The data and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出Explore to Evolve范式，构建可验证的网页代理训练数据WebAggregatorQA，开发WebAggregator系列模型在信息聚合任务上超越GPT-4.1，接近Claude-3.7-sonnet。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源深度研究代理主要关注信息检索能力，忽视了信息聚合这一支持深度研究的关键需求。

Method: 采用Explore to Evolve范式：首先通过主动在线探索收集真实网页证据，然后自演化聚合程序，从12种高级逻辑类型中选择、组合和优化操作来合成可验证的QA对。

Result: 构建了包含10K样本、覆盖50K网站和11个领域的WebAggregatorQA数据集。WebAggregator-8B性能匹配GPT-4.1，32B版本在GAIA-text上超越GPT-4.1超过10%，接近Claude-3.7-sonnet。在WebAggregatorQA测试集上，Claude-3.7-sonnet仅得28%，GPT-4.1得25.8%。

Conclusion: 即使代理能够检索到所有参考资料，在WebAggregatorQA上仍然表现不佳，凸显了需要加强网页代理基础模型的信息聚合能力。

Abstract: Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources
such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly,
they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful
research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly
focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate
specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information
aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We
propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training
data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources
grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence,
the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and
refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable
QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed
us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K
websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents,
we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of
foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of
GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text
and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited
availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation
abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA
as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves
28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all
references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to
strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

*Reid T. Johnson,Michelle D. Pain,Jordan D. West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLT框架用自然语言输出替代LLM中的编程式JSON工具调用，通过解耦工具选择和响应生成来提高工具调用性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决编程式JSON工具调用中的任务干扰和格式约束问题，这些因素会降低工具调用性能

Method: 提出Natural Language Tools框架，将工具选择与响应生成分离，消除任务干扰和格式限制

Result: 在10个模型和6400次试验中，工具调用准确率提高18.4个百分点，输出方差降低70%，开源模型获益最大

Conclusion: NLT显著提升工具调用性能，且改进在提示扰动下保持稳定，还能为缺乏原生支持的模型扩展工具调用能力

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces
programmatic JSON tool calling in large language models (LLMs) with natural
language outputs. By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT
eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call
performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer
service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4
percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see
the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with
implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and
extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiRA框架通过锚定对齐和多智能体协作编码，将低资源语言锚定到英语语义空间，结合语言感知轻量推理头，在低资源条件下提升跨语言表示、检索和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高资源语言上性能接近饱和，但在低资源语言上表现较差，主要由于训练数据有限、机器翻译噪声和跨语言对齐不稳定。

Method: LiRA包含两个模块：Arca（通过锚定对齐和多智能体协作编码将低资源语言锚定到英语语义空间）和LaSR（在Arca基础上添加语言感知轻量推理头，使用一致性正则化）。

Result: 在低资源基准测试（跨语言检索、语义相似性和推理）中，在少样本和噪声增强设置下均显示出持续增益和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LiRA框架有效提升了低资源语言的跨语言表示能力，同时增强了检索和推理的鲁棒性，并通过消融实验验证了Arca和LaSR模块的贡献。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource
languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains
substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to
limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual
alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

*Matt Grenander,Shay B. Cohen,Mark Steedman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种压缩表示方法，通过提取和重新组织实体级标记来提高序列到序列共指消解模型在增量设置中的效率，在保持性能的同时实现1.8的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序列到序列共指消解模型虽然取得了最先进的性能，但在增量设置（如对话）中缺乏灵活性和效率，无法有效处理顺序输入的文本。

Method: 通过提取和重新组织实体级标记，并丢弃大部分其他输入标记，创建压缩表示来提高效率。

Result: 在OntoNotes上，最佳模型仅比完整前缀增量基线低0.6 CoNLL F1点，同时实现1.8的压缩比；在LitBank上超过最先进性能。

Conclusion: 在序列到序列共指消解器中丢弃大部分标记是增量共指消解的一种可行策略。

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个新的数据集和分析框架来评估主权LLMs的社会文化元素和技术鲁棒性，发现虽然这些模型在支持低资源语言方面有意义，但并未完全满足服务目标用户的需求，且可能低估安全等关键质量属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏验证主权LLMs是否与用户社会文化背景对齐以及是否保持安全性和技术鲁棒性的框架和数据集，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建新数据集并引入分析框架，用于提取和评估主权LLMs的社会文化元素，同时评估其技术鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，主权LLMs在支持低资源语言方面有意义，但并未完全满足服务目标用户的需求，且追求未经测试的主张可能导致低估安全等关键质量属性。

Conclusion: 推进主权LLMs需要更广泛的评估，包含更全面和实用的标准。

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

TL;DR: 提出了WritingPreferenceBench数据集，发现当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误而非主观质量偏好，生成式奖励模型通过显式推理链在创意写作偏好评估中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法在标准基准上表现良好，但当移除客观质量信号时性能显著下降，需要评估模型在纯主观偏好任务中的能力。

Method: 构建包含1,800个人工标注偏好对的数据集，覆盖8种创意写作体裁，确保回答在客观正确性、事实准确性和长度上匹配，比较序列奖励模型、零-shot语言模型和生成式奖励模型的性能。

Result: 序列奖励模型平均准确率仅52.7%，零-shot语言模型53.9%，而生成式奖励模型达到81.8%；不同写作体裁间模型性能方差大，标准差平均10.1%；模型规模对性能提升无一致性影响。

Conclusion: 当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误，成功的偏好建模可能需要中间推理表示而非直接分类，生成式奖励模型在捕捉主观质量偏好方面更有效。

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CodeSeq，一个基于数字序列的合成后训练数据集，通过将数字序列打包成算法问题来发现通用项，并定义了通用项生成任务。该方法通过反思失败的测试案例和迭代修正来生成监督微调数据，同时利用基于可解性和自导案例生成成功率的强化学习奖励机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有归纳推理研究面临两个挑战：现有归纳数据主要关注表面规律而缺乏复杂内部模式；当前工作仅提示LLMs或在简单提示-响应对上进行微调，但未提供精确的思考过程也未实现难度控制。

Method: 构建CodeSeq数据集，将数字序列打包为算法问题来发现通用项。通过反思失败测试案例和迭代修正生成监督微调数据，同时使用基于可解性和自导案例生成成功率的强化学习奖励机制。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用CodeSeq训练的模型在各种推理任务上表现提升，并能保持模型的分布外性能。

Conclusion: CodeSeq方法通过系统化的数据生成和强化学习机制，有效提升了LLMs在归纳推理任务上的表现，同时保持了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLAIF-SPA框架通过强化学习结合AI反馈机制，使用ASR和LLM技术分别评估语义准确性和韵律-情感标签对齐，提升情感语音合成的表达性和可理解性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TTS系统在情感表达方面存在不足，现有方法依赖昂贵的情感标注或优化间接目标，导致生成的语音准确但情感平淡。

Method: 提出RLAIF-SPA框架，利用强化学习从AI反馈机制，通过ASR评估语义准确性，LLM评估韵律-情感标签对齐，在结构、情感、速度和音调四个维度上优化表达质量。

Result: 在Libri Speech数据集上，RLAIF-SPA优于Chat-TTS，WER降低26.1%，SIM-O提高9.1%，人工评估提升超过10%。

Conclusion: RLAIF-SPA框架有效提升了情感语音合成的表达性和自然度，通过直接优化语义准确性和韵律-情感对齐实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、无需标签的意图聚类方法，使用轻量级开源LLM生成伪标签，通过多标签分类实现聚类，无需预先知道聚类数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖商业LLM成本高、透明度低，以及需要预先知道聚类数量的问题。

Method: 使用LLM为每个文本生成伪标签，然后在伪标签集上进行多标签分类，基于相同聚类的文本共享更多标签的假设。

Result: 在四个基准测试集上取得了与最新基线相当或更好的结果，方法简单且计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于低资源场景，在多个模型和数据集上表现稳定，伪标签比直接相似度匹配更具可读性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our
findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and
is stable across multiple models and datasets.

Motivation: 现有搜索增强型LLMs的奖励建模存在局限性：基于规则的奖励对表达变化脆弱且不适用于长文本任务，而生成式奖励在动态语料库中设计可验证且稳定的奖励具有挑战性且计算成本高。

Method: 提出"nugget-as-rubric"范式，将原子信息点作为结构化评估标准；设计基于查询重写的自动rubric构建流程；开发4B参数的Search-Gen-V生成验证器，采用蒸馏思想和两阶段训练策略。

Result: 实验结果显示Search-Gen-V在不同工作负载下实现了强大的验证准确性，使其成为搜索增强型LLMs的可扩展、鲁棒且高效的可验证奖励构造器。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的统一可验证范式解决了现有奖励建模的局限性，为搜索增强型LLMs提供了更有效的奖励机制，特别是在长文本任务和动态语料库场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种方法教机器翻译模型学习特定结构的语义韵律，聚焦中文"被"字被动句的负面语义韵律，通过微调多个MT模型提升翻译准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义韵律是语言单位与搭配词形成的共现意义，不同于语义意义。直译词可能有不同的语义韵律，需要特别关注以生成准确翻译，但当前机器翻译模型无法处理这个问题。

Method: 针对中文"被"字被动句创建英汉句子对数据集，展示其负面语义韵律，然后微调OPUS-MT、NLLB-600M和mBART50模型进行英汉翻译任务。

Result: 微调后的MT模型在翻译负面内容时更善于使用"被"字被动句，避免在中性和正面内容中使用。NLLB-600M中的语义韵律知识还能从英汉翻译转移到其他语言对如西汉翻译。

Conclusion: 通过专门的数据集和微调，可以成功教机器翻译模型学习特定结构的语义韵律，提升翻译准确性，且这种知识在多语言模型中具有可转移性。

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI医疗工具快速发展带来偏见、隐私侵犯和不平等获取等风险，现有自动风险检测方法减少了人类参与理解危害产生和影响对象的过程。

Method: 开发人类中心框架，生成用户故事并支持多智能体讨论，在部署前帮助人们创造性思考AI的潜在益处和危害。

Result: 用户研究中，阅读故事的参与者识别了更广泛的危害类型，响应均匀分布在13种危害类型上；未阅读故事的参与者主要关注隐私和健康（58.3%）。

Conclusion: 故事讲述帮助参与者推测更广泛的危害和益处，更创造性地思考AI对用户的影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader
range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm
types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy
and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants
speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型已从感知任务发展到复杂多步推理，但仅奖励最终答案正确性的强化学习往往导致虚假推理，需要过程级监督来改进。

Method: 采用可扩展的自聚合方法从成功轨迹中提炼一致推理检查点，无需人工标注或更强教师模型即可构建问题特定评分标准，联合利用评分标准和结果奖励。

Result: 在六个多模态推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在专门评估中显著提高推理忠实度。

Conclusion: AutoRubric-R1V通过自动评分标准生成和过程级监督有效解决了多模态推理中的虚假推理问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

TL;DR: Pluto是一个用于评估LLM生成Verilog代码效率的基准测试框架，包含114个问题、自检测试平台和帕累托最优参考实现。实验显示LLM在功能正确性上可达78.3%，但在面积、延迟和功耗效率上仅约64%，远低于专家设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注功能正确性，但硬件设计还需要优化面积、延迟和功耗等综合指标。现有基准缺乏优化基线和验证测试平台，无法全面评估LLM生成的硬件设计效率。

Method: 开发Pluto基准测试框架，包含114个设计问题，每个问题都配备自检测试平台和多个帕累托最优参考实现，用于全面评估LLM生成的Verilog代码在功能正确性和综合效率方面的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，最先进的LLM在功能正确性上达到78.3%（pass@1），但在综合效率方面明显落后：面积效率63.8%、延迟效率65.9%、功耗效率64.0%（eff@1），远低于专家设计的实现。

Conclusion: 硬件设计的LLM研究需要像Pluto这样的效率感知评估框架来推动进展，因为仅关注功能正确性不足以满足实际硬件设计对效率优化的需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights
the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive
progress in hardware-focused LLM research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COIG-Writer是一个中文创意写作数据集，包含1,665个精心策划的三元组，涵盖51种文体，每个三元组包含逆向工程提示、详细创作推理和最终文本。研究发现创意写作需要过程监督与通用数据的平衡，创意能力具有文化特异性，且词汇多样性与创意质量呈负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在创意写作方面存在系统性缺陷，特别是在非英语语境中，训练数据稀缺且缺乏过程级监督。为了解决这个问题，作者创建了COIG-Writer数据集来捕捉多样输出及其底层思维过程。

Method: 通过系统逆向工程高质量文本，构建包含1,665个三元组的中文创意写作数据集，每个三元组包含逆向工程提示、详细创作推理和最终文本。通过全面实验识别创意写作的两组件模型：叙事逻辑和语言表达。

Result: 发现三个关键见解：(1)过程监督非常有效但需要与通用数据稳定化，至少需要1:12的创意与通用样本比例；(2)创意能力具有文化特异性，中英文表现差距达89.26个百分点；(3)词汇多样性与创意质量呈负相关（TTR悖论）。

Conclusion: 创意卓越源于逻辑支架与语言基础的相互作用，类似于数学推理增强但不能替代基础模型中的语言能力。过程监督与通用数据的适当平衡是实现高质量创意写作的关键。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现推理模型的性能和答案分布对答案提取算法高度敏感，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 使用额外模型推理，将原始输入输出加上"Answer:"前缀重新生成答案，从中选择或提取最终答案。

Result: 该方法在数学问题和开放式问答任务中表现出改进的性能和增强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为模型评估提供了更可靠的结果，是提取规则无关的稳健方法。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了对比学习(CL)和监督微调(SFT)在基于大语言模型的检索重排序中的效果，发现SFT在权重更新方面优于CL，从而在整体性能上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息检索中，BERT编码器通常使用对比学习效果更好，而大语言模型(LLMs)则更适合使用监督微调进行分类。这种差异引发了对哪种目标函数更适合LLM重排序的核心问题。

Method: 将目标函数分解为权重和方向两个组件，通过统一框架分析它们的相互作用，并在通用多模态检索(UMR)平台上进行综合比较实验。

Result: SFT提供了比CL更强的权重方案，而评分方向没有明显优势。大规模训练验证了SFT在MRB基准测试中达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: SFT在LLM重排序中具有一致的优势，研究结果为该领域的未来研究和应用提供了有益指导。

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部数据的在线测试时框架，通过自监督优化MoE模型的路由决策，在文本生成过程中持续改进专家选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在部署中常因分布偏移导致路由决策不佳，现有测试时适应方法主要针对密集模型且需要外部数据，限制了在MoE架构中的实用性。

Method: 采用两阶段循环：在预填充阶段和定期间隔中，基于已生成序列通过自监督优化路由决策；然后正常生成文本，保持修改后的路由器直到下一次适应。通过轻量级加法向量仅更新选定层的路由器logits。

Result: 在挑战性推理任务上获得一致性能提升，如HumanEval上提升5.5%，同时保持对上下文偏移的鲁棒性。与自一致性等技术结合时获得6%的平均增益。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了数据自由、在线的测试时MoE路由优化，具有即插即用特性，能自然补充现有测试时缩放技术。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管中期训练在语言模型预训练中很流行，但对其有效性的科学理解很少，本文旨在系统研究这一训练阶段及其有效性原因。

Method: 通过控制实验，使用从头开始预训练的语言模型，在不同领域的监督微调数据集上进行实验，并对中期训练的开始时间和数据混合权重进行消融研究。

Result: 在数学和代码领域，中期训练在领域内验证损失和预训练数据遗忘方面均优于持续预训练，且开始时间比混合权重影响更大，较早引入专业数据效果更好。

Conclusion: 中期训练是一种领域适应技术，相比持续预训练，通过减少遗忘获得更好的性能。

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared
to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用编译器在抽象并行性、局部性和同步时限制了在现代空间架构上的效率，需要显式机制来协调计算和数据以充分利用这些架构。

Method: 基于MLIR构建MLIR-AIR编译器栈，定义AIR方言提供异步和分层操作的结构化表示，支持空间调度、跨硬件区域的计算分布以及通信与计算的重叠。

Result: 在矩阵乘法中达到78.7%的计算效率，性能接近手工优化的MLIR-AIE实现；多头注意力仅需约150行代码即可实现融合实现。

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR能够将高层次结构化控制流转换为高效利用NPU计算结构和内存层次的空间程序，通过编译器管理的调度实现异步执行、分块和通信重叠。

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

Motivation: LLM在语义等效输入下经常产生不一致的输出，而现有训练数据缺乏一致性关注，微调技术也难以有效提升输出一致性。

Method: 采用系统化合成数据生成、三元组损失优化嵌入表示，以及基于中间层激活的一致性感知权重的分层模型融合方法。

Result: 融合模型显著提升了输出一致性，在响应相似度上比基线提高了约47.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升工业RAG系统的可靠性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

Conclusion: 这些发现为训练计算和上下文利用之间的相互作用提供了有价值的见解，为设计更高效的长上下文LLM用于多样化下游任务提供了指导。

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

Motivation: 由于主观评估、临床资源有限以及污名化，抑郁症、焦虑症和PTSD等心理健康问题经常被误诊，在初级保健环境中误诊率超过60%，迫切需要可扩展、易获取且情境感知的诊断工具来支持早期检测和干预。

Method: 使用553个真实世界半结构化访谈数据集，评估了多种模型类别，包括GPT-4.1 Mini和MetaLLaMA的零样本提示，以及使用低秩适应（LoRA）微调的RoBERTa模型。

Result: 模型在所有诊断类别中达到超过80%的准确率，PTSD检测表现特别出色（最高89%准确率和98%召回率）。使用较短、聚焦的上下文片段可提高召回率，LoRA微调在低秩配置下保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的模型相比传统自报告筛查工具可提供显著改进，为低门槛、AI驱动的早期诊断开辟了道路，为在资源匮乏或高污名化环境中整合机器学习到临床工作流程奠定了基础。

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅提高了模型的推理性能，还赋予了其显著的自奖励能力，从而提升了推理时的扩展性能。

Conclusion: LaSeR通过简单的最后一个token自奖励机制，有效解决了RLVR中的效率问题，同时保持了性能优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on
general text; however, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains that
require deep, interconnected knowledge remains largely uncharacterized.
Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways,
heterogeneous identifier systems, and fragmented databases. To systematically
evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first
benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public
resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics
research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our
evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance
patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态生成模型在处理方言文本输入时性能显著下降32.26%-48.17%，现有缓解方法效果有限且会损害标准英语性能。作者提出了一种编码器缓解策略，能在提升方言性能的同时保持标准英语性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态生成模型能否有效处理方言文本输入，因为方言使用者在与生成模型交互时经常使用方言。

Method: 构建包含6种英语方言的大规模基准数据集，收集4200多个经过验证的提示，评估17个图像和视频生成模型。提出基于编码器的缓解策略，教导模型识别新方言特征同时保持标准英语性能。

Result: 当前最先进的多模态生成模型在提示中使用单个方言词时性能下降32.26%-48.17%。提出的方法能将5种方言性能提升至与标准英语相当(+34.4%)，同时对标准英语性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 多模态生成模型在处理方言输入时存在显著性能差距，提出的编码器缓解策略能有效解决这一问题，在提升方言性能的同时保持标准英语性能。

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

TL;DR: 提出IGPO框架，通过信息增益为多轮智能体训练提供密集内在奖励，解决传统结果奖励稀疏性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体在强化学习中依赖最终答案的结果奖励，在多轮交互中面临奖励稀疏、优势崩溃和信用分配困难的问题

Method: IGPO将每轮交互建模为获取真实答案信息的增量过程，基于策略对正确答案概率的边际增长定义轮级内在奖励，并与结果级监督结合形成密集奖励轨迹

Result: 在域内和域外基准测试中，IGPO在多轮场景下持续优于强基线，实现了更高准确率和改进的样本效率

Conclusion: IGPO通过内在信息增益奖励有效解决了多轮智能体训练中的奖励稀疏问题，显著提升了性能

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

TL;DR: UI-Simulator是一个可扩展的范式，通过生成结构化UI状态和转换来大规模合成训练轨迹，解决了数字代理需要多样化UI轨迹但数据收集成本高昂的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字代理需要多样化的大规模UI轨迹来泛化现实世界任务，但收集此类数据在人工标注、基础设施和工程方面成本过高。

Method: 整合数字世界模拟器生成多样化UI状态，引导展开过程实现连贯探索，以及轨迹包装器生成高质量多样化训练轨迹。还提出了UI-Simulator-Grow目标扩展策略，通过优先处理高影响力任务和合成信息丰富的轨迹变体来实现更快速的数据高效扩展。

Result: 在WebArena和AndroidWorld上的实验表明，UI-Simulator与在真实UI上训练的开源代理相当或更优，具有更好的鲁棒性。UI-Simulator-Grow仅使用Llama-3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型就能达到Llama-3-70B-Instruct的性能。

Conclusion: 目标合成扩展范式具有持续高效增强数字代理的潜力，为解决UI轨迹数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker
teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of
Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,
highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to
continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.

*Yinxi Li,Yuntian Deng,Pengyu Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了TokDrift框架，发现代码LLMs对语义相同但格式不同的代码会产生不同的tokenization，导致模型行为显著变化，揭示了subword tokenization与代码语法不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码LLMs使用基于统计的subword tokenizer（如BPE），但代码语法与自然语言不同，导致语义相同的代码片段可能因格式差异而被不同地tokenize，影响模型可靠性。

Method: 开发TokDrift框架，应用语义保持的重写规则创建仅在tokenization上不同的代码变体，分析9个代码LLMs（包括超过30B参数的大模型）的行为变化。

Result: 即使微小的格式变化也会导致模型行为显著偏移，分层分析显示问题源于早期嵌入层，subword分割未能捕捉语法token边界。

Conclusion: tokenization与语法不匹配是代码LLMs可靠性的隐藏障碍，未来需要语法感知的tokenization方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

*Quan Nguyen-Tri,Mukul Ranjan,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Elastic-Cache方法，通过自适应地重新计算扩散大语言模型中的KV缓存，在保持生成质量的同时显著降低解码延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个去噪步骤和所有层都重新计算所有token的QKV，但KV状态在大多数步骤中变化很小，特别是在浅层，导致大量冗余计算。

Method: 基于三个观察：1）远处的MASK token可作为长度偏置进行块状缓存；2）KV动态随深度增加，从深层开始选择性刷新即可；3）最受关注的token具有最小的KV漂移。提出Elastic-Cache策略，联合决定何时刷新（通过注意力感知漂移测试）和在哪里刷新（通过深度感知调度）。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务上实现显著加速：GSM8K上8.7倍，长序列上45.1倍，HumanEval上4.8倍，同时保持比基线更高的准确率。吞吐量比现有基于置信度的方法高6.8倍。

Conclusion: Elastic-Cache通过自适应、层感知的缓存更新，减少了冗余计算，加速了扩散LLM的解码，同时保持了生成质量，实现了扩散LLM的实际部署。

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SOTA ASR系统主要依赖声学信息而忽略了多模态上下文，但视觉信息对于消歧和适应至关重要。特别是在科学演示场景中，演示幻灯片包含重要的领域特定术语信息。

Method: 首先创建了多模态演示基准测试，包括自动分析转录领域特定术语；然后探索了用多模态信息增强语音模型的方法；通过数据增强技术解决缺乏配套幻灯片数据集的问题；最后使用增强数据集训练模型。

Result: 训练得到的模型相比基线模型，在所有词汇上的词错误率相对降低了约34%，在领域特定术语上的词错误率相对降低了约35%。

Conclusion: 集成演示幻灯片的多模态ASR系统能够显著提升科学演示场景下的语音识别性能，特别是在处理领域特定术语方面效果显著。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型共识声明生成框架缺乏提供可证明公平性保证的结构，无法在聚合多样化自由形式意见时确保公平性。

Method: 将任务建模为多目标、令牌级的马尔可夫决策过程，每个目标对应一个代理的偏好。基于代理策略推导令牌级奖励，提出两种社会选择理论方法：保证核心稳定性的随机生成策略和最大化平等主义福利的搜索算法。

Result: 实验表明，使用语言模型实例化代理策略时，基于平等主义目标的搜索生成的共识声明在最低代理对齐度方面优于基线方法，包括Habermas Machine。

Conclusion: 该MDP框架为社会选择理论分析提供了正式结构，提出的方法能够在文本生成中提供可证明的公平性保证，并改善最坏情况下的代理对齐。

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

Method: 重新设计早期多智能体系统中的黑板架构，创建一个模块化、可配置的测试平台，识别关键攻击向量（错位、恶意代理、通信被破坏、数据中毒），并在三个协作多智能体场景中实施四种代表性攻击。

Result: 开发了Terrarium框架，能够快速原型化、评估和迭代防御措施和设计，展示了框架的灵活性。

Conclusion: Terrarium框架旨在加速可信多智能体系统的进展，通过提供工具来研究安全、隐私和安全性问题。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: AI4Service范式将AI从被动工具转变为主动伴侣，Alpha-Service框架为实现这一愿景提供了可行方案，展示了主动式AI服务的潜力。

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂推理和规划任务中仍面临挑战，多智能体系统虽然能提供更好的集体推理，但存在推理成本高、延迟长和端到端训练困难等问题。

Method: 提出IMAGINE框架，通过端到端训练将多智能体系统的能力集成到单个模型中，使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型进行训练。

Result: 训练后的模型在TravelPlanner基准上达到82.7%的最终通过率，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%，同时保持更小的模型规模。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功将多智能体系统的优势集成到单个紧凑模型中，显著提升了复杂推理和规划能力，同时降低了推理成本。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

Conclusion: 提出了改进方向和可行的技术路径，以基于实验结果增强代理在复杂长时程问题上的性能，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

Conclusion: TITAN框架成功实现了自然语言威胁查询到可执行推理的自动化连接，支持确定性的图谱推理执行。

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的生成-过滤-精炼迭代范式在推理、编程和科学发现方面取得进展，但搜索效果依赖于如何将领域先验编码到结构化假设空间中。

Method: 将智能体表示为输入输出的模糊关系算子，通过安全包络约束智能体；使用单延续参数加权所有可达路径，求和得到覆盖生成函数；提供可测试的推断并通过多数投票实例验证。

Conclusion: 提出的形式理论为LLM辅助的迭代搜索提供了工作语言和操作工具，能够系统地描述和测量由LLM构建的迭代搜索过程。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

Conclusion: 基于判别式验证器的预算感知扩展不仅是自一致性的免费升级，也是比昂贵生成式技术更有效和高效的替代方案

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有抑郁症自动检测研究范围有限，缺乏系统特征比较和一致评估协议，本文旨在填补这些空白。

Method: 系统探索EEG、语音和文本的特征表示和建模策略，评估手工特征与预训练嵌入，比较不同神经编码器，分析单模态、双模态和三模态配置及融合策略。

Result: EEG、语音和文本三模态组合增强多模态检测，预训练嵌入优于手工特征，精心设计的三模态模型达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 本研究为多模态抑郁症检测的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

### [135] [Stable but Miscalibrated: A Kantian View on Overconfidence from Filters to Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14925)
*Akira Okutomi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将康德的《纯粹理性批判》重新解释为反馈稳定性理论，提出复合不稳定性指数(H-Risk)来衡量推理系统的稳定性，发现在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中，更高的H-Risk预测过度自信错误和幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立康德理性自我限制理论与反馈控制理论之间的结构性桥梁，为诊断和减少推理系统中的过度自信提供原则性视角。

Method: 提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk，结合谱边界、条件数、时间敏感性和创新放大等指标；在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中进行实验验证。

Result: 在线性高斯模拟中，更高的H-Risk预测过度自信错误；在LLMs中，脆弱的内部动态与错误校准和幻觉相关，批判式提示对校准和幻觉的影响混合。

Conclusion: 康德的自我限制理论与反馈控制之间存在结构性联系，H-Risk为诊断和选择性减少推理系统中的过度自信提供了原则性工具。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能够学习创造复杂机器，这既是人类智能的标志，也是工程实践的基础。通过组合式机器设计任务来评估LLMs在物理环境中的创造能力。

Method: 引入BesiegeField测试平台，基于Besiege游戏构建，支持基于零件的构造、物理模拟和奖励驱动评估。使用代理工作流程对最先进的LLMs进行基准测试，并探索强化学习微调作为改进方法。

Result: 识别出成功所需的关键能力包括空间推理、策略组装和指令遵循。当前开源模型表现不足，但强化学习微调实验显示了改进潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究突出了语言、机器设计和物理推理交叉领域的开放挑战，为LLMs在创造性工程设计中的应用提供了基准和方向。

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个计算框架，通过结合用户的历史发帖和社交邻近同伴的讨论来早期检测社交媒体上的隐性自杀意念，相比仅基于个人信息的基线方法提高了15%的检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在社交媒体上，许多有自杀意念的用户不会明确表达痛苦，而是通过日常发帖或同伴互动间接表现出来。早期检测这些隐性信号至关重要但具有挑战性。

Method: 采用复合网络中心性度量识别用户的顶级邻居，在时间上对齐用户和邻居的互动，将多层信号集成到微调的DeBERTa-v3模型中。

Result: 在Reddit上对1000名用户（500名案例和500名对照）的研究中，该方法比仅基于个人信息的基线方法提高了15%的早期隐性自杀意念检测准确率。

Conclusion: 同伴互动提供了有价值的预测信号，对设计能够捕捉在线环境中间接和隐蔽风险表达的早期检测系统具有更广泛的意义。

Abstract: On social media, many individuals experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) do not
disclose their distress explicitly. Instead, signs may surface indirectly
through everyday posts or peer interactions. Detecting such implicit signals
early is critical but remains challenging. We frame early and implicit SI as a
forward-looking prediction task and develop a computational framework that
models a user's information environment, consisting of both their longitudinal
posting histories as well as the discourse of their socially proximal peers. We
adopted a composite network centrality measure to identify top neighbors of a
user, and temporally aligned the user's and neighbors' interactions --
integrating the multi-layered signals in a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model. In a
Reddit study of 1,000 (500 Case and 500 Control) users, our approach improves
early and implicit SI detection by 15% over individual-only baselines. These
findings highlight that peer interactions offer valuable predictive signals and
carry broader implications for designing early detection systems that capture
indirect as well as masked expressions of risk in online environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的ICD编码分配方法，将其视为分类和排序任务，而不仅仅是分类任务，以考虑ICD代码的顺序重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记中的ICD代码顺序对医疗诊断和报销至关重要，但现有方法将其视为分类任务而忽略了代码顺序。

Method: 从检索系统角度处理该问题，将其制定为分类和排序任务，同时考虑代码分配和优先级排序。

Result: 在主要诊断代码排序准确率达到47%（相比现有方法的20%），在分类指标上micro-F1为0.6065，macro-F1为0.2904，均优于之前最佳模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在识别高优先级代码方面具有优越能力，同时保持了良好的分类性能。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在特定任务部署时的高计算成本和内存需求问题，通过极低位量化实现高效推理。

Method: 结合三种关键技术：BitNet的SubLN模块、基于MiniLM的多头注意力蒸馏、以及作为关键预热步骤的持续预训练。

Result: 在保持与全精度模型相当性能的同时，实现了10倍内存节省和2.65倍的CPU推理加速。

Conclusion: BitDistill为特定任务部署提供了高效的1.58位量化解决方案，平衡了性能与效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出可逆模型融合方法，解决低秩压缩模型合并时的性能下降问题，通过构建紧凑基空间而非单一合并模型来保持各任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型融合方法应用于低秩权重时会导致严重性能下降，需要新的方法来在模型压缩场景下保持各任务性能。

Method: 提出可逆模型融合方法，构建紧凑基空间，通过线性组合恢复原始任务特定模型，提供闭式解选择最优基权重和任务特定系数。

Result: 在多样化数据集和模型规模上的实验表明，RMM始终优于现有融合方法，显著保持低秩压缩模型的性能。

Conclusion: 将模型融合重新定义为生成可重构模型空间而非单一合并模型，能够有效解决低秩压缩模型合并的性能问题。

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

Method: 结合专业智能体、结构化推理和基于评判者的共识机制，支持通过配置而非代码更改来定义自定义标注类型，实现动态任务适应。

Result: 消除了100万条话语积压，平均86%与人工标注者一致，每年节省5000多小时人工标注工作，在多个数据集上比传统方法提升13.8%的Top-1准确率、15.1%的Top-5准确率和16.9%的F1分数。

Conclusion: MAFA弥合了理论多智能体系统与实际企业部署之间的差距，为面临类似标注挑战的组织提供了蓝图。

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible
evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型作为黑盒的问题，现有可解释性方法各有局限，需要新的视角来理解Transformer层的内部机制。

Method: 使用Moore-Penrose伪逆估计每层的实际变换矩阵，应用包含六个可解释指标的谱分析，并进行核分析来研究层间功能关系。

Conclusion: CAST提供了理解Transformer层功能的新视角，揭示了不同模型架构的层行为差异，为模型可解释性研究做出了贡献。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统分析了基于LLM的提示优化中的投毒风险，发现基于反馈的攻击比注入查询攻击更有效，并提出了一种无需访问奖励模型的简单假奖励攻击方法，同时提出了轻量级高亮防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM系统现在支撑着日常AI应用，性能通常依赖于精心设计的提示。虽然基于LLM的提示优化器通过迭代优化减少了这种努力，但优化阶段的安全性仍未得到充分检验。

Method: 使用HarmBench进行系统性分析，引入简单的假奖励攻击方法（无需访问奖励模型），并提出轻量级高亮防御策略。

Result: 发现系统对操纵反馈的脆弱性显著高于注入查询：基于反馈的攻击使攻击成功率提升高达ΔASR=0.48。假奖励攻击将ΔASR从0.23提升到0.07，同时不降低效用。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明提示优化管道是一个重要的攻击面，需要为反馈通道和优化框架提供更强的安全保障。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

TL;DR: 提出AEPO算法解决Agentic RL中熵信号过度依赖导致的训练崩溃问题，通过动态熵平衡机制在14个数据集上超越7种主流RL算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流Agentic RL算法过度依赖熵信号来引导不确定性工具调用步骤，但过度依赖会施加额外约束导致训练崩溃，需要平衡熵在训练过程中的作用。

Method: AEPO包含两个核心组件：(1)动态熵平衡rollout机制，通过熵预监测自适应分配采样预算，并对连续高熵步骤施加分支惩罚；(2)熵平衡策略优化，在高熵裁剪项中插入停止梯度操作，并结合熵感知优势估计。

Result: 在14个挑战性数据集上，AEPO持续优于7种主流RL算法。仅使用1K RL样本，Qwen3-14B在GAIA上达到47.6%，Humanity's Last Exam上11.2%，WebWalker上43.0%的Pass@1性能。

Conclusion: AEPO提高了rollout采样多样性同时保持稳定的策略熵，促进了可扩展的web agent训练。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了WeightLens和CircuitLens两种互补方法，通过直接分析权重和特征交互来增强神经网络的可解释性，超越了传统的基于激活的分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性方法依赖人工检查且局限于简单任务，自动化方法又容易忽略特征间交互并过度依赖外部LLM和数据集质量。

Method: WeightLens直接从学习到的权重解释特征，无需解释模型或数据集；CircuitLens捕捉特征激活如何从组件交互中产生，揭示电路级动态。

Result: WeightLens在上下文无关特征上匹配或超越现有方法性能；CircuitLens能够识别仅基于激活的方法无法发现的电路级动态。

Conclusion: 这两种方法提高了可解释性的鲁棒性，增强了电路的可扩展机制分析，同时保持了效率和质量。

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型原理的新采样器，用于加速循环深度语言模型的生成过程，在保持相同时间预算下实现高达5倍的加速，同时理论上比自回归生成更具表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索循环深度模型与扩散语言模型之间的关系，利用它们的相似性来加速循环深度模型的推理生成过程。

Method: 开发了一种新的扩散强制采样器，通过在每次前向传递时解码新token，同时并行细化这些token的潜在状态，结合了扩散模型原理和循环深度架构。

Result: 该采样器可直接应用于现有的35亿参数循环深度transformer，无需调优即可实现高达5倍的加速，且在相同时间预算下比自回归生成更具表达能力。

Conclusion: 循环深度模型可以自然地被视为强大的连续（尽管是因果的）扩散语言模型，该采样器为并行化循环深度模型的额外计算提供了高效机制。

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

TL;DR: 提出一种联合建模Big Five和HEXACO人格特质的多模态识别方法，通过优化联合识别来改善人格特质识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注Big Five人格特质识别，但忽略了HEXACO模型中的诚实-谦逊特质，且两种模型在机器学习中的关系尚未明确。

Method: 通过联合优化识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质的多模态方法，利用自我介绍视频数据集进行实验。

Result: 实验证明所提方法能有效识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质。

Conclusion: 联合建模Big Five和HEXACO可以改善多模态人类行为感知，为人格特质识别提供更全面的方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于像素级关键点定位的新框架，包含点描述器和点定位器两个组件，能够通过自然语言实现精确的关键点理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型仅限于对象级或区域级定位，缺乏通过自然语言进行像素级精确关键点理解的能力。

Method: 框架包含点描述器生成关键点的上下文描述，点定位器从描述回归像素坐标。使用LlamaPointInPart数据集训练，通过GRPO优化描述器。

Result: 在LlamaPointInPart数据集上实验表明，相比基线模型具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 该双向框架为关键点引导的图像理解和语言引导的精确定位开辟了新应用方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其在面部识别领域的潜力尚未充分探索，特别是开源MLLMs需要在标准基准上与传统面部识别模型进行性能比较。

Method: 在多个面部识别数据集（LFW、CALFW、CPLFW、CFP、AgeDB、RFW）上对最先进的MLLMs进行系统性基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，MLLMs能够捕捉面部相关任务的有用语义线索，但在零样本应用的高精度识别场景中表现不如专用模型。

Conclusion: 该基准为推进基于MLLM的面部识别提供了基础，为设计具有更高准确性和泛化能力的下一代模型提供了见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

TL;DR: 提出nlg2choice方法解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉分类中的评估问题，通过两阶段方法：先开放式回答，再用约束解码预测最可能选项，显著提升分类和检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注纯语言任务或不超过5个选项的多选题，无法处理细粒度视觉分类中数百到数千个高度相关选项的情况，且在多选项设置中扩展LLM选择提取到基于检索的问题存在计算成本高的挑战。

Method: nlg2choice两阶段方法：第一阶段向MLLM提出开放式问题，第二阶段使用纯文本约束解码预测最可能的选择。在检索设置中，采用早停方法计算约束响应的选择概率，显著提高吞吐量。

Result: 在七个细粒度视觉数据集上的实验显示，该方法在分类和检索评估方面均有改进，且性能在不同自然语言任务实现方式下保持稳定。

Conclusion: nlg2choice方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉分类中的评估挑战，特别是在多选项和检索场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

TL;DR: MathCanvas框架赋予统一大型多模态模型内在的视觉思维链能力，通过视觉操作预训练和策略性视觉辅助推理微调，在数学几何问题上实现86%的相对性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本推理方面表现出色，但在依赖视觉辅助的数学领域（如几何）表现不佳，现有视觉思维链方法受限于外部工具或无法生成高质量、时机恰当的图表。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 视觉操作阶段预训练模型掌握图表生成和编辑；2) 策略性视觉辅助推理阶段微调模型学习何时及如何利用视觉辅助。

Result: BAGEL-Canvas模型在MathCanvas-Bench基准上相比强基线LMM实现86%相对改进，在其他公共数学基准上表现出良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该工作提供完整工具包（框架、数据集和基准），解锁LMM中复杂、类人的视觉辅助推理能力。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

Motivation: 将生成式人工智能整合到专业遗产实践中，旨在提高面向公众的指导文档的可访问性。

Method: 开发了HAZEL GenAI聊天机器人，通过微调专门用于协助修订遗产保护和解释相关的书面指导。使用定量评估比较HAZEL与ChatGPT在指导编写过程中的表现。

Result: HAZEL在性能上略优于ChatGPT，表明经过微调后的GenAI聊天机器人更有效。但在需要文化敏感性和高级技术专业知识的领域存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 虽然GenAI无法在技术编写任务中取代人类遗产专业人士，但其自动化和加速指导编写某些方面的潜力可为遗产组织（特别是在资源受限环境中）提供宝贵价值。

Abstract: This paper discusses the potential for integrating Generative Artificial
Intelligence (GenAI) into professional heritage practice with the aim of
enhancing the accessibility of public-facing guidance documents. We developed
HAZEL, a GenAI chatbot fine-tuned to assist with revising written guidance
relating to heritage conservation and interpretation. Using quantitative
assessments, we compare HAZEL's performance to that of ChatGPT (GPT-4) in a
series of tasks related to the guidance writing process. The results of this
comparison indicate a slightly better performance of HAZEL over ChatGPT,
suggesting that the GenAI chatbot is more effective once the underlying large
language model (LLM) has been fine-tuned. However, we also note significant
limitations, particularly in areas requiring cultural sensitivity and more
advanced technical expertise. These findings suggest that, while GenAI cannot
replace human heritage professionals in technical authoring tasks, its
potential to automate and expedite certain aspects of guidance writing could
offer valuable benefits to heritage organisations, especially in
resource-constrained contexts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过被动观察用户行为自动推断即时目标的方法，然后基于这些目标优化LLM输出，从而生成更符合用户需求的工具和响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在缺乏具体目标时会产生平庸的结果，如充满陈词滥调的邮件草稿。通过推断用户的即时目标并针对该目标进行优化，可以使LLM产生更响应和受欢迎的工具、界面和响应。

Method: 贡献了一种架构，通过被动观察用户行为自动诱导即时目标，然后通过生成和评估来引导下游AI系统针对这些目标进行优化。

Result: 在一系列实验中，JIT目标使LLM输出在用户自身任务上达到66-86%的胜率，超过典型LLM。现场使用会话确认JIT目标为每个参与者生成了独特的专用工具。

Conclusion: 诱导即时目标（如"澄清摘要的研究贡献"）能够自动生成工具，例如基于相关HCI方法论批评草稿、预测相关研究人员的反应或识别模糊术语的工具。

Abstract: Large language models promise a broad set of functions, but when not given a
specific objective, they default to milquetoast results such as drafting emails
littered with cliches. We demonstrate that inferring the user's in-the-moment
objective, then rapidly optimizing for that singular objective, enables LLMs to
produce tools, interfaces, and responses that are more responsive and desired.
We contribute an architecture for automatically inducing just-in-time
objectives by passively observing user behavior, then steering downstream AI
systems through generation and evaluation against this objective. Inducing
just-in-time objectives (e.g., "Clarify the abstract's research contribution")
enables automatic generation of tools, e.g., those that critique a draft based
on relevant HCI methodologies, anticipate related researchers' reactions, or
surface ambiguous terminology. In a series of experiments (N=14, N=205) on
participants' own tasks, JIT objectives enable LLM outputs that achieve 66-86%
win rates over typical LLMs, and in-person use sessions (N=17) confirm that JIT
objectives produce specialized tools unique to each participant.
