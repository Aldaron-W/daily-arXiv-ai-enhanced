### [1] [Rethinking Toxicity Evaluation in Large Language Models: A Multi-Label Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15007)
*Zhiqiang Kou,Junyang Chen,Xin-Qiang Cai,Ming-Kun Xie,Biao Liu,Changwei Wang,Lei Feng,Yuheng Jia,Gang Niu,Masashi Sugiyama,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了三个多标签毒性检测基准(Q-A-MLL、R-A-MLL、H-X-MLL)，基于15类细粒度毒性分类法，并通过理论证明和实验验证了伪标签训练方法的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前毒性检测器主要依赖单标签基准，无法充分捕捉真实世界毒性提示的模糊性和多维度特性，导致评估偏差和检测不可靠。同时，获取细粒度多标签注释成本高昂。

Method: 从公共毒性数据集构建三个多标签基准，采用15类毒性分类法进行标注。提出伪标签毒性检测方法，并理论证明伪标签训练优于单标签监督学习。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法显著超越了包括GPT-4o和DeepSeek在内的先进基线，在多标签毒性检测方面实现了更准确可靠的评估。

Conclusion: 提出的多标签基准和伪标签方法有效解决了毒性检测中的评估偏差问题，为LLM生成内容的多标签毒性评估提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a range
of natural language processing tasks, but their potential to generate harmful
content has raised serious safety concerns. Current toxicity detectors
primarily rely on single-label benchmarks, which cannot adequately capture the
inherently ambiguous and multi-dimensional nature of real-world toxic prompts.
This limitation results in biased evaluations, including missed toxic
detections and false positives, undermining the reliability of existing
detectors. Additionally, gathering comprehensive multi-label annotations across
fine-grained toxicity categories is prohibitively costly, further hindering
effective evaluation and development. To tackle these issues, we introduce
three novel multi-label benchmarks for toxicity detection: \textbf{Q-A-MLL},
\textbf{R-A-MLL}, and \textbf{H-X-MLL}, derived from public toxicity datasets
and annotated according to a detailed 15-category taxonomy. We further provide
a theoretical proof that, on our released datasets, training with pseudo-labels
yields better performance than directly learning from single-label supervision.
In addition, we develop a pseudo-label-based toxicity detection method.
Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly surpasses
advanced baselines, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, thus enabling more accurate
and reliable evaluation of multi-label toxicity in LLM-generated content.

### [2] [Can generative AI figure out figurative language? The influence of idioms on essay scoring by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15009)
*Enis Oğuz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了生成式AI模型对含成语和不含成语学生作文的评分表现，发现Gemini在评分一致性和处理比喻语言方面表现最佳，有望用于自动作文评分系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI技术发展迅速，已被提议作为自动作文评分系统的竞争者。考虑到AI在处理成语方面的潜在局限性，本研究旨在评估生成式AI模型对含成语和不含成语作文的评分表现。

Method: 从348篇学生作文中创建两个相等的作文列表：一个每篇包含多个成语，另一个不含成语。使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Deepseek三个生成式AI模型，按照人类评分者使用的相同评分标准对两组作文各评分三次。

Result: 所有模型都表现出极好的一致性，但Gemini在与人类评分者的评分者间信度方面优于竞争对手。AI评估未检测到对任何人口群体的偏见。对于含多个成语的作文，Gemini的评分模式与人类评分者最为相似。

Conclusion: 研究中的模型展示了混合方法的潜力，但Gemini因其处理比喻语言的能力成为最佳候选，未来有望单独处理作文评分任务。

Abstract: The developments in Generative AI technologies have paved the way for
numerous innovations in different fields. Recently, Generative AI has been
proposed as a competitor to AES systems in evaluating student essays
automatically. Considering the potential limitations of AI in processing
idioms, this study assessed the scoring performances of Generative AI models
for essays with and without idioms by incorporating insights from Corpus
Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. Two equal essay lists were created
from 348 student essays taken from a corpus: one with multiple idioms present
in each essay and another with no idioms in essays. Three Generative AI models
(ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek) were asked to score all essays in both lists
three times, using the same rubric used by human raters in assigning essay
scores. The results revealed excellent consistency for all models, but Gemini
outperformed its competitors in interrater reliability with human raters. There
was also no detectable bias for any demographic group in AI assessment. For
essays with multiple idioms, Gemini followed a the most similar pattern to
human raters. While the models in the study demonstrated potential for a hybrid
approach, Gemini was the best candidate for the task due to its ability to
handle figurative language and showed promise for handling essay-scoring tasks
alone in the future.

### [3] [A Generalizable Rhetorical Strategy Annotation Model Using LLM-based Debate Simulation and Labelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15081)
*Shiyu Ji,Farnoosh Hashemi,Joice Chen,Juanwen Pan,Weicheng Ma,Hefan Zhang,Sophia Pan,Ming Cheng,Shubham Mohole,Saeed Hassanpour,Soroush Vosoughi,Michael Macy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出利用大语言模型自动生成和标注修辞策略辩论数据的框架，基于因果、经验、情感、道德四类修辞类型学，训练的分类器在多个外部语料库上表现出高性能和强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 修辞策略分析依赖人工标注，成本高、不一致且难以扩展，现有数据集局限于特定主题和策略，限制了模型开发。

Method: 利用大语言模型自动生成和标注合成辩论数据，基于四类修辞类型学（因果、经验、情感、道德），在LLM标注的数据集上微调基于Transformer的分类器。

Result: 模型在人类标注数据和多个外部语料库上实现高性能和强泛化，应用显示：1）加入修辞策略标签可提高说服力预测；2）分析1960-2020年美国总统辩论发现情感论证使用增加。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效自动分析修辞策略，揭示了美国总统辩论中情感论证的上升趋势，证明了方法的实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Rhetorical strategies are central to persuasive communication, from political
discourse and marketing to legal argumentation. However, analysis of rhetorical
strategies has been limited by reliance on human annotation, which is costly,
inconsistent, difficult to scale. Their associated datasets are often limited
to specific topics and strategies, posing challenges for robust model
development. We propose a novel framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and label synthetic debate data based on a
four-part rhetorical typology (causal, empirical, emotional, moral). We
fine-tune transformer-based classifiers on this LLM-labeled dataset and
validate its performance against human-labeled data on this dataset and on
multiple external corpora. Our model achieves high performance and strong
generalization across topical domains. We illustrate two applications with the
fine-tuned model: (1) the improvement in persuasiveness prediction from
incorporating rhetorical strategy labels, and (2) analyzing temporal and
partisan shifts in rhetorical strategies in U.S. Presidential debates
(1960-2020), revealing increased use of affective over cognitive argument in
U.S. Presidential debates.

### [4] [Continual Learning via Sparse Memory Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15103)
*Jessy Lin,Luke Zettlemoyer,Gargi Ghosh,Wen-Tau Yih,Aram Markosyan,Vincent-Pierre Berges,Barlas Oğuz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出稀疏记忆微调方法，通过仅更新被新知识高度激活的记忆槽来减少灾难性遗忘，在问答任务中相比全微调和LoRA显著降低了遗忘率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型部署后通常保持静态，持续学习面临灾难性遗忘问题。受参数共享导致遗忘的启发，研究稀疏参数更新是否能实现无灾难性遗忘的学习。

Method: 引入稀疏记忆微调，利用记忆层模型的设计特性，仅更新被新知识高度激活的记忆槽，减少新知识与模型现有能力之间的干扰。

Result: 在问答任务评估中，稀疏记忆微调学习新知识的同时遗忘显著减少：NaturalQuestions F1仅下降11%，而全微调下降89%，LoRA下降71%。

Conclusion: 记忆层中的稀疏性为大语言模型的持续学习提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Modern language models are powerful, but typically static after deployment. A
major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is
catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired
capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is
challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we
investigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging
memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by
design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new
piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce
interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We
evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and
parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We
find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting
substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after
full finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields
only an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results
suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual
learning in large language models.

### [5] [Measuring the Effect of Disfluency in Multilingual Knowledge Probing Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15115)
*Kirill Semenov,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过比较MLAMA数据集在斯拉夫语言中的模板翻译与整句翻译，发现整句翻译能显著提高知识检索分数，建议在多语言数据集中控制语法正确性以获得更可解释的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言事实知识评估基准（如MLAMA）使用模板翻译，忽视了命名实体的语法和语义信息，导致最终提示存在语法错误或措辞不当，特别是在形态丰富的语言中，这影响了分数的可解释性。

Method: 从MLAMA数据集中选取4种斯拉夫语言，比较初始模板翻译与Google Translate和ChatGPT整句翻译的知识检索分数，并进行定性分析。

Result: 整句翻译显著提高了知识检索分数，在其他5种不同语系语言中也观察到类似模式。

Conclusion: 建议在多语言数据集中控制语法正确性，使用神经机器翻译或LLM系统进行整句翻译可获得更高且更可解释的结果。

Abstract: For multilingual factual knowledge assessment of LLMs, benchmarks such as
MLAMA use template translations that do not take into account the grammatical
and semantic information of the named entities inserted in the sentence. This
leads to numerous instances of ungrammaticality or wrong wording of the final
prompts, which complicates the interpretation of scores, especially for
languages that have a rich morphological inventory. In this work, we sample 4
Slavic languages from the MLAMA dataset and compare the knowledge retrieval
scores between the initial (templated) MLAMA dataset and its sentence-level
translations made by Google Translate and ChatGPT. We observe a significant
increase in knowledge retrieval scores, and provide a qualitative analysis for
possible reasons behind it. We also make an additional analysis of 5 more
languages from different families and see similar patterns. Therefore, we
encourage the community to control the grammaticality of highly multilingual
datasets for higher and more interpretable results, which is well approximated
by whole sentence translation with neural MT or LLM systems. The dataset and
all related code is published at the Github repository:
https://github.com/ZurichNLP/Fluent-mLAMA.

### [6] [Latent Topic Synthesis: Leveraging LLMs for Electoral Ad Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15125)
*Alexander Brady,Tunazzina Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端的框架，用于从无标签语料库自动生成可解释的主题分类法，结合无监督聚类和基于提示的标注，利用大语言模型迭代构建分类法，无需种子集或领域专业知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台在塑造政治话语中发挥关键作用，但分析其庞大且快速演变的内容仍是一个重大挑战。需要可扩展、可解释的方法来分析政治信息。

Method: 结合无监督聚类与基于提示的标注，利用大语言模型迭代构建主题分类法，应用于2024年美国总统选举前一个月的Meta政治广告语料库。

Result: 发现投票和移民广告在总支出和展示量中占主导地位，而堕胎和选举诚信话题获得不成比例的关注度。资金模式高度两极化，不同议题的道德框架存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 该框架支持对社交媒体政治信息进行可扩展、可解释的分析，使研究人员、政策制定者和公众能更好地理解新兴叙事、极化动态和数字政治沟通的道德基础。

Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse,
but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major
challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically generating an
interpretable topic taxonomy from an unlabeled corpus. By combining
unsupervised clustering with prompt-based labeling, our method leverages large
language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring
seed sets or domain expertise. We apply this framework to a large corpus of
Meta (previously known as Facebook) political ads from the month ahead of the
2024 U.S. Presidential election. Our approach uncovers latent discourse
structures, synthesizes semantically rich topic labels, and annotates topics
with moral framing dimensions. We show quantitative and qualitative analyses to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our findings reveal that voting
and immigration ads dominate overall spending and impressions, while abortion
and election-integrity achieve disproportionate reach. Funding patterns are
equally polarized: economic appeals are driven mainly by conservative PACs,
abortion messaging splits between pro- and anti-rights coalitions, and
crime-and-justice campaigns are fragmented across local committees. The framing
of these appeals also diverges--abortion ads emphasize liberty/oppression
rhetoric, while economic messaging blends care/harm, fairness/cheating, and
liberty/oppression narratives. Topic salience further reveals strong
correlations between moral foundations and issues. Demographic targeting also
emerges. This work supports scalable, interpretable analysis of political
messaging on social media, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the public
to better understand emerging narratives, polarization dynamics, and the moral
underpinnings of digital political communication.

### [7] [FarsiMCQGen: a Persian Multiple-choice Question Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15134)
*Mohammad Heydari Rad,Rezvan Afari,Saeedeh Momtazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出FarsiMCQGen方法，用于生成波斯语多项选择题，结合候选生成、筛选和排序技术，并引入包含10,289个问题的新波斯语MCQ数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在波斯语等低资源语言中生成高质量多项选择题面临挑战，需要开发专门的方法来改进教育测试。

Method: 结合Transformer、知识图谱和基于规则的方法，通过候选生成、过滤和排序技术生成可信的干扰项。

Result: 构建了包含10,289个问题的波斯语MCQ数据集，经最先进大语言模型评估，证明了模型有效性和数据集质量。

Conclusion: FarsiMCQGen方法在波斯语MCQ生成方面表现有效，新数据集有望推动MCQ相关研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are commonly used in educational testing, as
they offer an efficient means of evaluating learners' knowledge. However,
generating high-quality MCQs, particularly in low-resource languages such as
Persian, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces FarsiMCQGen, an
innovative approach for generating Persian-language MCQs. Our methodology
combines candidate generation, filtering, and ranking techniques to build a
model that generates answer choices resembling those in real MCQs. We leverage
advanced methods, including Transformers and knowledge graphs, integrated with
rule-based approaches to craft credible distractors that challenge test-takers.
Our work is based on data from Wikipedia, which includes general knowledge
questions. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel Persian MCQ dataset
comprising 10,289 questions. This dataset is evaluated by different
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model and the quality of the generated dataset, which has
the potential to inspire further research on MCQs.

### [8] [Structure-R1: Dynamically Leveraging Structural Knowledge in LLM Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15191)
*Junlin Wu,Xianrui Zhong,Jiashuo Sun,Bolian Li,Bowen Jin,Jiawei Han,Qingkai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Structure-R1框架，通过强化学习将检索内容转换为结构化表示，提升大语言模型在知识密集型任务中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统使用非结构化文本导致信息密度低、推理效果不佳，需要更高效的结构化知识表示方法。

Method: 使用强化学习动态生成任务特定的结构化表示，并引入自奖励结构验证机制确保生成结构的正确性和自包含性。

Result: 在7个知识密集型基准测试中，7B规模的模型达到竞争性性能，与更大模型表现相当。

Conclusion: 结构化表示通过提高信息密度和上下文清晰度来增强推理能力，为知识密集型任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
reasoning capabilities. However, their performance remains constrained by
limited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as
context to augment reasoning. Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically
operate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information
density and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into
structured representations optimized for reasoning. Leveraging reinforcement
learning, \textsc{Structure-R1} learns a content representation policy that
dynamically generates and adapts structural formats based on the demands of
multi-step reasoning. Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our
approach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific
structures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and
reliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural
verification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both
correct and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive
benchmarks show that \textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive
performance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much
larger models. Additionally, our theoretical analysis demonstrates how
structured representations enhance reasoning by improving information density
and contextual clarity. Our code and data are available at:

### [9] [Extending Audio Context for Long-Form Understanding in Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15231)
*Yuatyong Chaichana,Pittawat Taveekitworachai,Warit Sirichotedumrong,Potsawee Manakul,Kunat Pipatanakul*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Partial YaRN（免训练音频扩展方法）和VLAT（虚拟长音频训练策略）来解决大型音频语言模型的长上下文限制问题，显著提升了长音频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型受限于短音频上下文窗口，即使其文本主干支持长上下文，这限制了长音频理解能力。现有上下文扩展方法主要针对单模态LLM，在音频语言模型中的应用尚未探索。

Method: 1. Partial YaRN：基于RoPE的免训练音频扩展方法，仅修改音频token位置，保持文本位置不变以保留基础LLM的文本能力；2. VLAT：训练时位置增强策略，在训练中模拟不同音频长度，使模型能泛化到远超训练所见长度的输入。

Result: 在SALMONN和Qwen2-Audio上的实验表明，Partial YaRN在多种设置下优于原始模型，VLAT训练策略带来显著改进，在未见长度的长音频上实现了强劲性能。

Conclusion: Partial YaRN和VLAT有效解决了LALMs的长上下文限制问题，Partial YaRN提供免训练扩展方案，VLAT通过训练时增强实现更好的泛化能力，为长音频理解提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are often constrained by short audio
context windows, even when their text backbones support long contexts, limiting
long-form audio understanding. Prior work has introduced context-extension
methods (e.g. YaRN) on unimodal LLMs, yet their application to LALMs remains
unexplored. First, building on RoPE-based context extension, we introduce
Partial YaRN, a training-free, audio-only extension method that modifies only
audio token positions, leaving text positions intact to preserve the base LLM's
text capabilities. Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a
training strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional
augmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling
generalization to inputs far longer than those seen in training and improving
robustness for long-context audio understanding. Our experiments on SALMONN and
Qwen2-Audio show that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide
range of settings, and VLAT training strategy provides substantial improvement,
achieving strong performance on long audio of unseen lengths.

### [10] [Planner and Executor: Collaboration between Discrete Diffusion And Autoregressive Models in Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15244)
*Lina Berrayana,Ahmed Heakl,Muhammad Abdullah Sohail,Thomas Hofmann,Salman Khan,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了离散扩散语言模型（DDLM）与自回归语言模型（ARM）的混合架构，发现在潜在空间中进行通信比文本空间通信能显著提升准确性，同时大幅减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自回归语言模型虽然准确率高但需要长序列标记，计算成本高。离散扩散语言模型支持并行生成且在某些复杂推理任务中表现优异，研究两者混合架构能否获得互补优势。

Method: 首先在文本空间中探索协作，一个模型规划推理过程，另一个基于规划执行最终答案。然后扩展到潜在空间通信，引入学习投影器将DDLM潜在表示映射到ARM嵌入空间。

Result: 从文本空间转向潜在空间通信带来显著准确率提升：DART-5从27.0%提升到54.0%，AIME24从0.0%提升到14.0%。使用DDLM规划器和ARM执行器可大幅节省计算，仅用64个标记规划和约5个标记执行，就超越了使用44倍标记的Qwen3.1-7B。

Conclusion: DDLM与ARM的混合架构在潜在空间通信中展现出巨大潜力，为复杂推理任务提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Current autoregressive language models (ARMs) achieve high accuracy but
require long token sequences, making them costly. Discrete diffusion language
models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of
steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex
reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid
architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration
can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space,
where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final
answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space
communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the
ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation
limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM
communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy
gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to
14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM
executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact
on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for
planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME,
despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights
into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid
architectures.

TL;DR: 本文系统综述了多模态RAG在文档理解中的应用，提出了基于领域、检索模态和粒度的分类法，总结了关键数据集、基准和应用，并指出了效率、细粒度表示和鲁棒性等开放挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档理解方法存在局限性：OCR+LLM流水线会丢失结构细节，而原生多模态LLM在上下文建模方面存在困难。多模态RAG能够通过跨所有模态的整体检索和推理来实现全面的文档智能。

Method: 提出了基于领域、检索模态和粒度的分类法，回顾了涉及图结构和代理框架的进展，总结了关键数据集、基准和应用。

Result: 系统梳理了多模态RAG在文档理解中的研究现状，建立了完整的分类体系，识别了当前技术发展的关键方向。

Conclusion: 多模态RAG为文档AI提供了有前景的范式，但仍需解决效率、细粒度表示和鲁棒性等挑战，为未来进展提供了路线图。

Abstract: Document understanding is critical for applications from financial analysis
to scientific discovery. Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines
feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face
key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles
with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models
in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text,
tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG.
This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities,
unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this
paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document
understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and
granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic
frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and
highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and
robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.

*Mucheng Ren,He Chen,Yuchen Yan,Danqing Hu,Jun Xu,Xian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TraceCoder是一个集成多源外部知识的新型ICD编码框架，通过动态整合UMLS、维基百科和大型语言模型等知识源来增强代码表示、弥合语义鸿沟，并处理罕见和模糊代码，提高可追溯性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有ICD编码方法面临的临床文本与ICD代码之间的语义鸿沟、罕见和长尾代码性能差、可解释性有限等问题。

Method: 提出TraceCoder框架，动态整合多源外部知识（UMLS、维基百科、LLMs），引入混合注意力机制建模标签、临床上下文和知识之间的交互。

Result: 在MIMIC-III-ICD9、MIMIC-IV-ICD9和MIMIC-IV-ICD10数据集上达到最先进性能，消融研究验证了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: TraceCoder为自动化ICD编码提供了可扩展且稳健的解决方案，满足临床对准确性、可解释性和可靠性的需求。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding assigns
standardized diagnosis and procedure codes to clinical records, playing a
critical role in healthcare systems. However, existing methods face challenges
such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on
rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these
issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source
external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding.
TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS,
Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations,
bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a
hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical
context, and knowledge, improving long-tail code recognition and making
predictions interpretable by grounding them in external evidence. Experiments
on MIMIC-III-ICD9, MIMIC-IV-ICD9, and MIMIC-IV-ICD10 datasets demonstrate that
TraceCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies
validating the effectiveness of its components. TraceCoder offers a scalable
and robust solution for automated ICD coding, aligning with clinical needs for
accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

*Mucheng Ren,Yucheng Yan,He Chen,Danqing Hu,Jun Xu,Xian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TACL（阈值自适应课程学习）框架，通过动态调整训练过程来处理医学文本的复杂性差异，在多种临床任务中取得显著改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学文本（特别是电子病历）具有非结构化、领域特定语言和上下文变异性等特点，现有方法将所有数据视为同等难度，忽略了临床记录中复杂性的内在差异，限制了模型在罕见或复杂病例上的泛化能力

Method: TACL框架基于渐进学习原则，根据样本复杂度动态调整训练过程，将数据分类为不同难度级别，在训练早期优先处理简单案例，为处理更复杂记录建立坚实基础

Result: 将TACL应用于多语言医学数据（包括英文和中文临床记录），在自动ICD编码、再入院预测和中医证候鉴别等多种临床任务中观察到显著改进

Conclusion: TACL不仅提升了自动化系统的性能，还展示了统一不同医学领域方法的潜力，为更准确、可扩展和全球适用的医学文本理解解决方案铺平了道路

Abstract: Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a
cornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient
care, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for
advancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their
unstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts
make automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements
in natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as
equally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across
clinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively
generalize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present
TACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to
address these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts
during training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL
dynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual
samples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler
cases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling
more complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including
English and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements
across diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission
prediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the
performance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify
approaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate,
scalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions.

TL;DR: 提出EGP框架，通过检索相似示例问题及其成功推理路径来指导LLM在知识图谱问答中的规划过程，显著提升了问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在知识图谱问答中存在的语义鸿沟问题，以及训练无关方法未能充分利用训练数据中有价值推理模式的问题。

Method: EGP框架：1) 通过实体模板化预处理训练集问题；2) 使用语义嵌入和FAISS索引检索相似示例；3) 在任务分解和关系探索两个阶段动态指导LLM规划；4) 引入智能前瞻机制提高效率。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ两个真实世界KGQA数据集上的实验表明，PoG-EGP显著优于基线PoG系统和其他对比方法。

Conclusion: EGP框架通过示例引导规划有效提升了LLM在知识图谱问答中的性能，证明了利用训练数据中成功推理模式的价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as interactive agents show significant promise
in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) but often struggle with the
semantic gap between natural language queries and structured knowledge graph
(KG) representations. This leads to suboptimal planning and inefficient
exploration on KG, while training-free approaches often underutilize valuable
reasoning patterns in training data. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework, Exemplar-Guided Planning (EGP), which enhances the planning
capabilities of LLM agents for KGQA. EGP first preprocesses the training set
questions via entity templating to normalize semantic variations. It then
retrieves highly similar exemplary questions and their successful reasoning
paths from this preprocessed set using semantic embeddings and an efficient
FAISS index. These retrieved exemplars dynamically guide the LLM's planning
process in two key phases: (1) Task Decomposition, by aligning generated
sub-objectives with proven reasoning steps, and (2) Relation Exploration, by
providing high-quality auxiliary information to improve relation pruning
accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Smart Lookahead mechanism during
relation exploration to improve efficiency by preemptively exploring promising
paths and potentially terminating exploration earlier. We apply EGP to the
Plan-on-Graph (PoG) framework, termed PoG-EGP. Extensive experiments on two
real-world KGQA datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that PoG-EGP
significantly improves over the baseline PoG system and other compared methods.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了Jaccard系数和余弦相似度在向量空间模型中的表现，发现余弦相似度在自动作文评分中表现更好，且一元文法比二元和三元文法具有更低的RMSE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动作文评分(AES)旨在提供高效准确的写作评估工具，本研究探索在向量空间模型中使用不同相似度度量和n-gram表示的有效性。

Method: 使用初中公民教育课程的形成性作文数据，通过n-gram模型进行特征提取和向量化，然后计算Jaccard系数和余弦相似度来评估作文相似性。

Result: 余弦相似度优于Jaccard系数，一元文法的均方根误差(RMSE)低于二元和三元文法。

Conclusion: 在自动作文评分中，余弦相似度配合一元文法特征提取是最有效的组合。

Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) is a vital area of research aiming to provide
efficient and accurate assessment tools for evaluating written content. This
study investigates the effectiveness of two popular similarity metrics, Jaccard
coefficient, and Cosine similarity, within the context of vector space
models(VSM)employing unigram, bigram, and trigram representations. The data
used in this research was obtained from the formative essay of the citizenship
education subject in a junior high school. Each essay undergoes preprocessing
to extract features using n-gram models, followed by vectorization to transform
text data into numerical representations. Then, similarity scores are computed
between essays using both Jaccard coefficient and Cosine similarity. The
performance of the system is evaluated by analyzing the root mean square error
(RMSE), which measures the difference between the scores given by human graders
and those generated by the system. The result shows that the Cosine similarity
outperformed the Jaccard coefficient. In terms of n-gram, unigrams have lower
RMSE compared to bigrams and trigrams.

TL;DR: CoordGen是一个移动推理框架，通过结合推测解码和动态硬件调度来加速移动设备上的上下文感知文本生成，实现了最高3.8倍的生成速度提升和4.7倍的能效提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备上的大语言模型虽然可以通过本地数据进行个性化增强，但其逐token生成过程由于内存限制特性导致高延迟和硬件利用率低的问题。

Method: CoordGen框架包含三个协同组件：自适应执行调度（动态平衡预填充和解码阶段的计算图）、上下文对齐草稿生成（通过轻量级在线校准提高推测效率）、硬件高效草稿扩展（重用和扩展中间序列以提高并行性）。

Result: 在多个智能手机和代表性工作负载上的实验显示，与现有移动推理解决方案相比，生成速度最高提升3.8倍，能效最高提升4.7倍。

Conclusion: CoordGen通过推测解码与动态硬件调度的协同优化，有效解决了移动设备上LLM推理的内存限制问题，显著提升了生成性能和能效。

Abstract: Enhancing on-device large language models (LLMs) with contextual information
from local data enables personalized and task-aware generation, powering use
cases such as intelligent assistants and UI agents. While recent developments
in neural processors have substantially improved the efficiency of prefill on
mobile devices, the token-by-token generation process still suffers from high
latency and limited hardware utilization due to its inherently memory-bound
characteristics. This work presents CoordGen, a mobile inference framework that
integrates speculative decoding with dynamic hardware scheduling to accelerate
context-aware text generation on mobile devices. The framework introduces three
synergistic components: (1) adaptive execution scheduling, which dynamically
balances compute graphs between prefill and decoding phases; (2)
context-aligned drafting, which improves speculative efficiency through
lightweight online calibration to current tasks; and (3) hardware-efficient
draft extension, which reuses and expands intermediate sequences to improve
processing parallelism and reduce verification cost. Experiments on multiple
smartphones and representative workloads show consistent improvements of up to
3.8x in generation speed and 4.7x in energy efficiency compared with existing
mobile inference solutions. Component-level analysis further validates the
contribution of each optimization.

Motivation: 理解大语言模型在古诗词创作和评估领域的表现，目前这方面的研究还很缺乏。

Method: 使用结合计算指标、LLM作为评判者和人类专家验证的三步评估框架，评估了六个最先进的LLM在多个诗歌质量维度上的表现。

Result: 分析揭示了系统性的生成和评估偏见：LLMs在评估创意质量时表现出"回音室"效应，常常趋同于与人类判断相悖的有缺陷标准。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs作为文学生成代理的能力既有潜力也有局限，在文化和技术上复杂的创意任务中仍需人类和模型的混合验证。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to creative domains,
yet their performance in classical Chinese poetry generation and evaluation
remains poorly understood. We propose a three-step evaluation framework that
combines computational metrics, LLM-as-a-judge assessment, and human expert
validation. Using this framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across
multiple dimensions of poetic quality, including themes, emotions, imagery,
form, and style. Our analysis reveals systematic generation and evaluation
biases: LLMs exhibit "echo chamber" effects when assessing creative quality,
often converging on flawed standards that diverge from human judgments. These
findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current capabilities
of LLMs as proxy for literacy generation and the limited evaluation practices,
thereby demonstrating the continued need of hybrid validation from both humans
and models in culturally and technically complex creative tasks.

Motivation: 现有知识图谱构建过程与下游应用脱节，导致图结构不理想，阻碍了检索增强生成系统在问答任务中的有效性。

Method: 提出AutoGraph-R1框架，使用强化学习训练LLM构造器，将图生成建模为策略学习问题，设计了两种任务感知的奖励函数：一种用于知识承载图，另一种用于知识索引图。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试中，AutoGraph-R1使图RAG方法相比任务无关的基线图谱实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究表明可以在构建和应用之间形成闭环，将范式从构建内在"好"的图谱转向构建可证明"有用"的图谱。

Abstract: Building effective knowledge graphs (KGs) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) is pivotal for advancing question answering (QA) systems. However, its
effectiveness is hindered by a fundamental disconnect: the knowledge graph (KG)
construction process is decoupled from its downstream application, yielding
suboptimal graph structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce AutoGraph-R1, the
first framework to directly optimize KG construction for task performance using
Reinforcement Learning (RL). AutoGraph-R1 trains an LLM constructor by framing
graph generation as a policy learning problem, where the reward is derived from
the graph's functional utility in a RAG pipeline. We design two novel,
task-aware reward functions, one for graphs as knowledge carriers and another
as knowledge indices. Across multiple QA benchmarks, AutoGraph-R1 consistently
enables graph RAG methods to achieve significant performance gains over using
task-agnostic baseline graphs. Our work shows it is possible to close the loop
between construction and application, shifting the paradigm from building
intrinsically ``good'' graphs to building demonstrably ``useful'' ones.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动可读性评估在确保有效和可访问的书面交流中起着关键作用，但该领域受到可读性定义不一致和依赖表层文本属性的测量方法的阻碍。

Method: 分析了897个人类可读性判断，评估了15个传统可读性指标和6个基于模型的指标在5个英语数据集上的表现。

Result: 4个基于模型的指标在与人类判断的排名相关性中始终位列前四，而表现最好的传统指标平均排名仅为8.6。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了当前可读性指标与人类感知之间的不匹配，指出基于模型的方法是更有前景的方向。

Abstract: Automatic readability assessment plays a key role in ensuring effective and
accessible written communication. Despite significant progress, the field is
hindered by inconsistent definitions of readability and measurements that rely
on surface-level text properties. In this work, we investigate the factors
shaping human perceptions of readability through the analysis of 897 judgments,
finding that, beyond surface-level cues, information content and topic strongly
shape text comprehensibility. Furthermore, we evaluate 15 popular readability
metrics across five English datasets, contrasting them with six more nuanced,
model-based metrics. Our results show that four model-based metrics
consistently place among the top four in rank correlations with human
judgments, while the best performing traditional metric achieves an average
rank of 8.6. These findings highlight a mismatch between current readability
metrics and human perceptions, pointing to model-based approaches as a more
promising direction.

Motivation: 现有集成方法在短文本生成中有效，但在长文本生成中效果不佳，因为每个token都集成会导致性能下降，需要找到合适的集成位置。

Method: 提出SAFE框架，选择性集成LLM，考虑分词不匹配和概率分布共识两个因素，并引入概率锐化策略来合并表示同一单词的子词token的概率。

Result: 在MATH500和BBH等基准测试中，SAFE在准确性和效率上都优于现有方法，即使集成少于1%的token也能获得性能提升。

Conclusion: SAFE通过选择性集成和概率锐化策略，有效解决了长文本生成中的集成问题，实现了更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: Ensembling Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention as a promising
approach to surpass the performance of individual models by leveraging their
complementary strengths. In particular, aggregating models' next-token
probability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be
effective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers,
its application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper,
we show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a
careful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of
ensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key
factors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models
and consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we
propose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively
ensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability,
we introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities
spread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single
representative token. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks, including MATH500
and BBH, demonstrate that SAFE outperforms existing methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, with gains achieved even when ensembling fewer than 1% of
tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在多样化文档类型上泛化能力差，特别是对分布外数据表现不佳，且高质量布局感知解析训练数据有限。

Method: 使用强化学习框架LayoutRL，通过综合奖励函数（归一化编辑距离、段落计数准确率、阅读顺序保持）优化布局理解，并构建Infinity-Doc-400K数据集训练Infinity-Parser视觉语言模型。

Result: 在OmniDocBench、olmOCR-Bench、PubTabNet和FinTabNet等基准测试中，Infinity-Parser在各类文档类型、语言和结构复杂度上均实现最先进性能，显著优于专业文档解析系统和通用视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: LayoutRL框架和Infinity-Parser模型为文档解析提供了强大的解决方案，具有良好的泛化能力，将开源代码、数据集和模型以促进可复现研究。

Abstract: Document parsing from scanned images into structured formats remains a
significant challenge due to its complexly intertwined elements such as text
paragraphs, figures, formulas, and tables. Existing supervised fine-tuning
methods often struggle to generalize across diverse document types, leading to
poor performance, particularly on out-of-distribution data. This issue is
further exacerbated by the limited availability of high-quality training data
for layout-aware parsing tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce
LayoutRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes layout
understanding through composite rewards integrating normalized edit distance,
paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. To support this
training, we construct the Infinity-Doc-400K dataset, which we use to train
Infinity-Parser, a vision-language model demonstrating robust generalization
across various domains. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including
OmniDocBench, olmOCR-Bench, PubTabNet, and FinTabNet show that Infinity-Parser
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of
document types, languages, and structural complexities, substantially
outperforming both specialized document parsing systems and general-purpose
vision-language models. We will release our code, dataset, and model to
facilitate reproducible research in document parsing.

Motivation: 测试Speech-LLMs在语音不流畅场景下的鲁棒性，特别是针对有语音障碍的用户群体，评估其实际应用准备度。

Method: 提出VocalBench-DF评估框架，系统评估22个主流Speech-LLMs在多维度分类下的不流畅处理能力。

Result: 发现Speech-LLMs性能显著下降，音素级处理和长上下文建模是主要瓶颈，通过增强识别和推理能力可显著改善鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发新方法来改进不流畅处理，构建真正包容的Speech-LLMs。

Abstract: While Speech Large Language Models (Speech-LLMs) show strong performance in
many applications, their robustness is critically under-tested, especially to
speech disfluency. Existing evaluations often rely on idealized inputs,
overlooking common disfluencies, particularly those associated with conditions
like Parkinson's disease. This work investigates whether current Speech-LLMs
can maintain performance when interacting with users who have speech
impairments. To facilitate this inquiry, we introduce VocalBench-DF, a
framework for the systematic evaluation of disfluency across a
multi-dimensional taxonomy. Our evaluation of 22 mainstream Speech-LLMs reveals
substantial performance degradation, indicating that their real-world readiness
is limited. Further analysis identifies phoneme-level processing and
long-context modeling as primary bottlenecks responsible for these failures.
Strengthening recognition and reasoning capability from components and
pipelines can substantially improve robustness. These findings highlight the
urgent need for new methods to improve disfluency handling and build truly
inclusive Speech-LLMs

Motivation: 在线游戏平台需要有效的广告和推荐系统，但现有推荐系统方法不适用于游戏场景，主要因为游戏稀疏性（游戏数量少）和游戏不平衡性（用户行为集中在少数热门游戏）。

Method: 引入用户游戏生命周期(UGL)来丰富用户行为数据，提出两种创新策略提取用户短期和长期兴趣，使用逆概率掩码策略解决游戏不平衡问题。

Result: 离线实验平均AUC提升1.83%，在线实验游戏广告点击转化率(CVR)平均提升21.67%，游戏内物品推荐离线AUC提升0.5%，在线平均每用户收入(ARPU)提升0.82%。

Conclusion: UGL表示学习方法有效解决了游戏推荐中的稀疏性和不平衡问题，显著提升了游戏广告和游戏内物品推荐的性能。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of video game production necessitates the development of
effective advertising and recommendation systems for online game platforms.
Recommending and advertising games to users hinges on capturing their interest
in games. However, existing representation learning methods crafted for
handling billions of items in recommendation systems are unsuitable for game
advertising and recommendation. This is primarily due to game sparsity, where
the mere hundreds of games fall short for large-scale user representation
learning, and game imbalance, where user behaviors are overwhelmingly dominated
by a handful of popular games. To address the sparsity issue, we introduce the
User Game Lifecycle (UGL), designed to enrich user behaviors in games.
Additionally, we propose two innovative strategies aimed at manipulating user
behaviors to more effectively extract both short and long-term interests. To
tackle the game imbalance challenge, we present an Inverse Probability Masking
strategy for UGL representation learning. The offline and online experimental
results demonstrate that the UGL representations significantly enhance model by
achieving a 1.83% AUC offline increase on average and a 21.67% CVR online
increase on average for game advertising and a 0.5% AUC offline increase and a
0.82% ARPU online increase for in-game item recommendation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based
guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their
effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language
Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This
study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for
generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a
synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains,
and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance
was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification
accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption
faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated
substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation
confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating
the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This
work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates
the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork
for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision
support.

Motivation: 现有MLLM评估主要关注被动推理，这与现实世界使用场景不符。现实应用中，模型需要在信息不完整时主动获取缺失证据并迭代优化决策。

Method: 提出GuessBench基准，包含感知导向和知识导向的图像，要求MLLM在无任务先验的情况下从候选池中选择目标图像，进行主动证据获取和迭代决策优化。

Result: 评估了20个优秀MLLM，发现主动推理性能远低于被动推理。细粒度感知和及时决策是主要挑战。消融研究表明感知增强对小模型有益，而思维导向方法对所有模型都有提升。

Conclusion: 多模态主动推理仍有很大改进空间，感知增强和思维导向方法是未来研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities
across a broad range of benchmarks. However, most existing evaluations focus on
passive inference, where models perform step-by-step reasoning under complete
information. This setup is misaligned with real-world use, where seeing is not
enough. This raises a fundamental question: Can MLLMs actively acquire missing
evidence under incomplete information? To bridge this gap, we require the MLLMs
to actively acquire missing evidence and iteratively refine decisions under
incomplete information, by selecting a target image from a candidate pool
without task-specific priors. To support systematic study, we propose
GuessBench, a benchmark with both perception-oriented and knowledge-oriented
images for evaluating active reasoning in MLLMs. We evaluate 20 superior MLLMs
and find that performance on active reasoning lags far behind it on passive
settings, indicating substantial room for improvement. Further analysis
identifies fine-grained perception and timely decision-making as key
challenges. Ablation studies show that perceptual enhancements benefit smaller
models, whereas thinking-oriented methods provide consistent gains across model
sizes. These results suggest promising directions for future research on
multimodal active reasoning.

Motivation: 解决传统摘要方法在质量和可控性方面的不足，探索如何通过提示工程优化大型语言模型的摘要生成能力。

Method: 设计多阶段提示生成框架，包括语义分析、主题建模和噪声控制，生成不同抽象层次的摘要。使用CNN/Daily Mail数据集进行实验。

Result: 提示长度对摘要质量有显著影响，过短或过长的提示都会降低质量；数据噪声会降低ROUGE-L分数；模型在新闻文本上表现最佳，学术文章表现较差。

Conclusion: 通过控制提示策略和优化文本预处理，可以有效提升大型语言模型摘要生成的准确性和可控性。

Abstract: This study presents a controllable abstract summary generation method for
large language models based on prompt engineering. To address the issues of
summary quality and controllability in traditional methods, we design a
multi-stage prompt generation framework. This framework generates summaries
with varying levels of abstraction by performing semantic analysis, topic
modeling, and noise control on the input text. The experiment uses the
CNN/Daily Mail dataset and provides a detailed analysis of different prompt
lengths, data noise, and text types. The experimental results show that prompt
length has a significant impact on the quality of generated summaries. Both
very short and very long prompt tokens result in a decrease in summary quality.
Data noise also negatively affects the summary generation process. As noise
levels increase, the ROUGE-L score gradually decreases. Furthermore, different
text types have varying effects on the model's ability to generate summaries.
The model performs best when handling news texts, while its performance is
worse when processing academic articles. This research provides new insights
into improving summary generation using large language models, particularly in
how controlling prompt strategies and optimizing text preprocessing can enhance
summary accuracy and controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云端LLM需要上传完整UI状态，暴露不必要信息；本地LLM容量有限，任务成功率低。需要平衡隐私保护和任务准确性。

Method: 包含三个关键组件：布局感知块分区、协同规划和协同决策，并引入多轮累积机制缓解本地误判。

Result: 实验显示CORE减少UI暴露达55.6%，任务成功率略低于纯云端代理，有效减轻不必要的隐私暴露。

Conclusion: CORE成功平衡了隐私保护和任务准确性，为移动代理提供了实用的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and execute tasks
on smartphone user interfaces (UIs). While cloud-based LLMs achieve high task
accuracy, they require uploading the full UI state at every step, exposing
unnecessary and often irrelevant information. In contrast, local LLMs avoid UI
uploads but suffer from limited capacity, resulting in lower task success
rates. We propose $\textbf{CORE}$, a $\textbf{CO}$llaborative framework that
combines the strengths of cloud and local LLMs to $\textbf{R}$educe UI
$\textbf{E}$xposure, while maintaining task accuracy for mobile agents. CORE
comprises three key components: (1) $\textbf{Layout-aware block partitioning}$,

hierarchy; (2) $\textbf{Co-planning}$, where local and cloud LLMs
collaboratively identify the current sub-task; and (3)

CORE further introduces a multi-round accumulation mechanism to mitigate local

### [28] [DeceptionBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for AI Deception Behaviors in Real-world Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15501)
*Yao Huang,Yitong Sun,Yichi Zhang,Ruochen Zhang,Yinpeng Dong,Xingxing Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeceptionBench是首个系统评估大语言模型在不同社会领域中欺骗行为的基准，涵盖经济、医疗、教育、社交和娱乐五大领域，包含150个场景和1000多个样本，揭示了模型在强化动态下欺骗行为加剧的关键漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的快速提升，其出现的欺骗行为可能在高风险部署中带来严重风险，而现实场景中的欺骗特征研究仍然不足。

Method: 构建DeceptionBench基准，从静态维度设计五大领域的150个场景和1000+样本；从内在维度探索模型的自利和奉承行为；从外在维度研究中性条件、奖励激励和胁迫压力下上下文因素如何调节欺骗输出；并纳入持续多轮交互循环模拟现实反馈动态。

Result: 在大语言模型和大推理模型上的广泛实验揭示了关键漏洞，特别是在强化动态下欺骗行为被放大，表明当前模型缺乏对操纵性上下文线索的稳健抵抗能力。

Conclusion: 当前模型对各种欺骗行为缺乏有效的安全防护，迫切需要开发先进的防护机制来应对不同形式的欺骗行为。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) across
diverse cognitive tasks, the rapid enhancement of these capabilities also
introduces emergent deceptive behaviors that may induce severe risks in
high-stakes deployments. More critically, the characterization of deception
across realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically
evaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains,
what their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect
them. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150
meticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare,
Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples,
providing sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the
intrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic
tendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the
extrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive
outputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive
pressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to
construct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics.
Extensive experiments across LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reveal
critical vulnerabilities, particularly amplified deception under reinforcement
dynamics, demonstrating that current models lack robust resistance to
manipulative contextual cues and the urgent need for advanced safeguards
against various deception behaviors. Code and resources are publicly available

*Ashutosh Bajpai,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为TEMP-ReCon的新基准，用于评估LLMs在时间引用一致性方面的表现，并开发了UnTRaP模型来提升LLMs的时间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在时间敏感领域（如法律、医疗、金融）中作为知识源的广泛应用，需要确保LLMs不仅事实准确，还要在时间维度上保持一致性，但目前缺乏对LLMs时间引用一致性的评估和改进方法。

Method: 提出了TEMP-ReCon基准来评估开源和闭源LLMs的时间引用一致性，并开发了基于推理路径对齐的UnTRaP模型来增强LLMs的时间一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前LLMs在时间引用一致性方面表现不足，而UnTRaP模型相比多个基线模型在提升时间一致性方面效果显著。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了LLMs时间一致性评估和改进的空白，提出的基准和模型为提升LLMs在时间敏感领域的可靠性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The increasing acceptance of large language models (LLMs) as an alternative
to knowledge sources marks a significant paradigm shift across various domains,
including time-sensitive fields such as law, healthcare, and finance. To
fulfill this expanded role, LLMs must not only be factually accurate but also
demonstrate consistency across temporal dimensions, necessitating robust
temporal reasoning capabilities. Despite this critical requirement, efforts to
ensure temporal consistency in LLMs remain scarce including noticeable absence
of endeavors aimed at evaluating or augmenting LLMs across temporal references
in time-sensitive inquiries. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by
introducing a novel benchmark entitled temporal referential consistency,
accompanied by a resource TEMP-ReCon designed to benchmark a wide range of both
open-source and closed-source LLMs with various linguistic contexts
characterized by differing resource richness (including English, French, and
Romanian). The findings emphasis that LLMs do exhibit insufficient temporal
referent consistency. To address this, we propose \newmodel, a reasoning path
alignment-based model that aims to enhance the temporal referential consistency
of LLMs. Our empirical experiments substantiate the efficacy of UnTRaP compared
to several baseline models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种动态字符分组方法，利用现有BPE分词结构，通过添加显式补丁结束标记和二级BPE压缩来控制补丁粒度，实现高效、灵活且语言无关的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决子词分词方法在表示罕见词时的低效性和需要大嵌入矩阵的问题，同时避免字符级模型的性能瓶颈和现有分层模型的局限性。

Method: 在现有BPE分词基础上添加显式补丁结束标记，引入二级BPE压缩阶段来控制补丁粒度，无需额外模型依赖。

Result: 实证结果表明，该方法在保持紧凑词汇表的同时，性能达到或超过基于动态熵和空格的补丁策略。

Conclusion: 提出的动态字符分组方法提供了一种高效、灵活且语言无关的表示方案，成功结合了子词和字符级模型的优势。

Abstract: Subword tokenization methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used in
large language models due to their balance of vocabulary compactness and
representational power. However, they suffer from inefficiencies in
representing rare words and require large embedding matrices. Character-level
models address these issues but introduce performance bottlenecks, particularly
in Transformer-based architectures. Recent hierarchical models attempt to merge
the benefits of both paradigms by grouping characters into patches, but
existing patching strategies either rely on whitespace-limiting applicability
to certain languages, or require auxiliary models that introduce new
dependencies. In this paper, we propose a dynamic character grouping method
that leverages the structure of existing BPE tokenization without requiring
additional models. By appending explicit end-of-patch markers to BPE tokens and
introducing a second-level BPE compression stage to control patch granularity,
our method offers efficient, flexible, and language-agnostic representations.
Empirical results demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds the
performance of dynamic entropy- and whitespace-based patching strategies, while
maintaining a compact vocabulary.

*Jingcheng Deng,Liang Pang,Zihao Wei,Shichen Xu,Zenghao Duan,Kun Xu,Yang Song,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Latent-SFT框架，通过将潜在推理限制在词汇表列空间中，实现了与显式推理相当的性能，同时将推理链缩短4倍，在多个数学推理任务上达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式推理（如思维链）计算开销大，而现有潜在推理方法性能显著下降。研究发现这是由于非结构化的潜在空间导致难以拟合潜在标记。

Method: 提出两阶段学习框架Latent-SFT：第一阶段设计专用注意力掩码指导潜在标记编码器生成潜在标记；第二阶段丢弃编码器，直接训练LLM自主生成潜在标记进行推理，使用KL和CE损失优化。

Result: 在GSM8k上匹配显式SFT性能，推理链缩短4倍，超越现有潜在方法。在Math500和AIME24上，基于词汇概率的潜在推理明显优于基于隐藏状态的方法。

Conclusion: 潜在推理既是单一路径的压缩，也是多路径的叠加，有效压缩率和有效全局并行度指标验证了这一点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities with
chain-of-thought prompting, but explicit reasoning introduces substantial
computational overhead. Recent work on latent reasoning reduces this cost by
reasoning in latent space without explicit supervision, but performance drops
significantly. Our preliminary experiments suggest that this degradation stems
from the unstructured latent space, which makes fitting latent tokens
difficult. To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of
the LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over
vocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an
eigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea,
we propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework. In the first stage, we
design two specialized attention masks to guide the Latent Token Encoder in
generating latent tokens, allowing the LLM to produce the correct answer
conditioned on them. In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is
discarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens
autonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT
sets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while
cutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent
methods. On Math500 and AIME24, lexical probability-based latent reasoning also
clearly surpasses hidden-state-based approaches. Our metrics of effective
compression rate and effective global parallelism further show that latent
reasoning is both the compression of a single path and the superposition of
multiple paths.

*Qiyu Wu,Shuyang Cui,Satoshi Hayakawa,Wei-Yao Wang,Hiromi Wakaki,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个模态组合感知框架，通过偏好损失和组合正则化目标来缓解统一编码器在对比学习中容易学习模态捷径的问题，从而提升多模态检索在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)能够作为统一编码器直接处理组合输入，但传统的对比学习训练容易导致模型学习模态捷径，在分布偏移下表现不佳。

Method: 提出模态组合感知框架，包含两个目标：偏好损失强制多模态嵌入优于单模态对应物；组合正则化目标将多模态嵌入与其单模态部分组合的原型对齐。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在分布外检索任务上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 模态组合感知是使用MLLMs作为统一编码器时实现鲁棒组合多模态检索的有效原则。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across
modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to
contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like
CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly
processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that
unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to
learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts.
We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue.
Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform
their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective
aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts.
These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed
representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks
show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition
awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval
when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.

TL;DR: 提出了TokenTiming算法，通过动态时间规整技术实现通用推测解码，解决了传统推测解码中草稿模型和目标模型必须共享词汇表的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码方法要求草稿模型和目标模型共享相同词汇表，这限制了可用草稿模型的选择范围，往往需要从头训练新模型，限制了推测解码的实用性。

Method: 基于动态时间规整算法，通过重新编码草稿标记序列获得新的目标标记序列，然后使用DTW建立映射来传输概率分布进行推测采样。

Result: 在多种任务上进行了全面实验，实现了1.57倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: 该方法使草稿模型选择更加通用，使推测解码成为更通用和实用的LLM加速工具。

Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a
critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially
improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a
fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same
vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often
necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose
the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by
re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and
then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for
speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched
vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and
modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks,
demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft
model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM
acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将跨语言差距归因于源语言和目标语言潜在表示的差异，本文提出不同观点，认为目标语言响应的方差是主要成因。

Method: 通过偏差-方差分解形式化跨语言差距，进行推理时干预实验控制方差，包括使用简单的提示指令减少响应方差。

Result: 减少响应方差的方法使目标语言准确率在不同模型中提升了20-25%。

Conclusion: 目标语言响应的方差是跨语言差距的主要成因，通过控制方差可以有效减少这一差距。

Abstract: Any piece of knowledge is usually expressed in one or a handful of natural
languages on the web or in any large corpus. Large Language Models (LLMs) act
as a bridge by acquiring knowledge from a source language and making it
accessible when queried from target languages. Prior research has pointed to a
cross-lingual gap, viz., a drop in accuracy when the knowledge is queried in a
target language compared to when the query is in the source language. Existing
research has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and
target languages as the source of cross-lingual gap. In this work, we take an
alternative view and hypothesize that the variance of responses in the target
language is the main cause of this gap. For the first time, we formalize the
cross-lingual gap in terms of bias-variance decomposition. We present extensive
experimental evidence which support proposed formulation and hypothesis. We
then reinforce our hypothesis through multiple inference-time interventions
that control the variance and reduce the cross-lingual gap. We demonstrate a
simple prompt instruction to reduce the response variance, which improved
target accuracy by 20-25% across different models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语言理解方面表现出色，但容易产生幻觉且在多跳推理方面存在困难。现有的知识图谱检索增强生成方法依赖平面嵌入和噪声路径探索，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出ParallaxRAG框架，将查询和图三元组对称解耦到多视图空间，利用不同注意力头在不同推理阶段专门处理语义关系的特点，构建更清晰的子图并引导LLM进行逐步推理。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ数据集上的实验表明，该方法在检索和问答性能方面具有竞争力，同时减少了幻觉并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多视图注意力头专业化是知识基础多跳推理的一个有原则的方向，为减少LLM幻觉和提升推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but often
hallucinate and struggle with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge-graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) offers grounding, yet most methods rely
on flat embeddings and noisy path exploration. We propose ParallaxRAG, a
framework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into
multi-view spaces, enabling a robust retrieval architecture that explicitly
enforces head diversity while constraining weakly related paths. Central to our
approach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in
semantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops
of the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct
cleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning.
Experiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 +
Llama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside
reduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view
head specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop
reasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is
accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估主要关注英语模型，忽视了其他语言的独特语言文化特征，特别是韩语在语法、形态、敬语和双数系统等方面的特殊性缺乏专门的评估基准。

Method: 开发了韩国指令跟随任务评估(KITE)基准，包含通用和韩语特定指令，结合自动指标和人工评估的综合评估流程。

Result: 评估揭示了不同模型之间的性能差异，深入分析了各模型的优势和弱点。

Conclusion: 通过公开KITE数据集和代码，旨在促进文化和语言包容性LLM开发的研究，并激励对其他代表性不足语言的类似努力。

Abstract: The instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
pivotal for numerous applications, from conversational agents to complex
reasoning systems. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on English
models, neglecting the linguistic and cultural nuances of other languages.
Specifically, Korean, with its distinct syntax, rich morphological features,
honorific system, and dual numbering systems, lacks a dedicated benchmark for
assessing open-ended instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce the Korean Instruction-following Task Evaluation (KITE), a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both general and Korean-specific
instructions. Unlike existing Korean benchmarks that focus mainly on factual
knowledge or multiple-choice testing, KITE directly targets diverse, open-ended
instruction-following tasks. Our evaluation pipeline combines automated metrics
with human assessments, revealing performance disparities across models and
providing deeper insights into their strengths and weaknesses. By publicly
releasing the KITE dataset and code, we aim to foster further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive LLM development and inspire similar
endeavors for other underrepresented languages.

Abstract: This paper delves into the intricate world of Urdu poetry, exploring its
thematic depths through a lens of polysemy. By focusing on the nuanced
differences between three seemingly synonymous words (pyaar, muhabbat, and
ishq) we expose a spectrum of emotions and experiences unique to the Urdu
language. This study employs a polysemic case study approach, meticulously
examining how these words are interwoven within the rich tapestry of Urdu
poetry. By analyzing their usage and context, we uncover a hidden layer of
meaning, revealing subtle distinctions which lack direct equivalents in English
literature. Furthermore, we embark on a comparative analysis, generating word
embeddings for both Urdu and English terms related to love. This enables us to
quantify and visualize the semantic space occupied by these words, providing
valuable insights into the cultural and linguistic nuances of expressing love.
Through this multifaceted approach, our study sheds light on the captivating
complexities of Urdu poetry, offering a deeper understanding and appreciation
for its unique portrayal of love and its myriad expressions

Motivation: 现有文档对齐方法在准确性和速度之间存在权衡，特别是在处理大规模网络挖掘数据时，需要同时考虑这两个因素

Method: 提出跨语言双向最大相似度评分方法，通过计算文档间的双向最大相似度来替代计算成本高的最优传输方法

Result: 在WMT16双语文档对齐任务中，BiMax方法达到与最优传输方法相当的准确度，但速度提升约100倍

Conclusion: BiMax方法在保持高准确度的同时显著提升了效率，为大规模文档对齐任务提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Document alignment is necessary for the hierarchical mining (Ba\~n\'on et
al., 2020; Morishita et al., 2022), which aligns documents across source and
target languages within the same web domain. Several high precision sentence
embedding-based methods have been developed, such as TK-PERT (Thompson and
Koehn, 2020) and Optimal Transport (OT) (Clark et al., 2019; El-Kishky and
Guzm\'an, 2020). However, given the massive scale of web mining data, both
accuracy and speed must be considered. In this paper, we propose a
cross-lingual Bidirectional Maxsim score (BiMax) for computing doc-to-doc
similarity, to improve efficiency compared to the OT method. Consequently, on
the WMT16 bilingual document alignment task, BiMax attains accuracy comparable
to OT with an approximate 100-fold speed increase. Meanwhile, we also conduct a
comprehensive analysis to investigate the performance of current
state-of-the-art multilingual sentence embedding models. All the alignment
methods in this paper are publicly available as a tool called EmbDA
(https://github.com/EternalEdenn/EmbDA).

introduce a new annotated corpus of three full-length French novels, totaling
over 285,000 tokens. Unlike previous datasets focused on shorter texts, our
corpus addresses the challenges posed by long, complex literary works, enabling
evaluation of coreference models in the context of long reference chains. We
present a modular coreference resolution pipeline that allows for fine-grained

TL;DR: HypoSpace是一个评估语言模型提出多种解释能力的诊断套件，通过有效性、独特性和覆盖率三个指标来衡量模型在不确定科学问题中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在科学工作流程中的广泛应用，需要评估它们提出多种解释而不仅仅是单一正确答案的能力，因为许多科学问题存在不确定性，多个机制不同的假设可能与相同观察结果一致。

Method: HypoSpace将LLMs视为有限假设集的采样器，在三个结构化领域实例化：因果图、重力约束的3D体素重建和布尔遗传相互作用，这些领域具有确定性验证器和精确枚举的假设空间。

Result: 研究发现，在指令调优和推理导向的模型中，有效性通常保持较高，但随着可接受空间的增长，独特性和覆盖率会下降，揭示了仅基于正确性指标无法发现的模式崩溃现象。

Conclusion: HypoSpace为明确探索和覆盖可接受解释空间的方法提供了一个受控探针，而不是简单的排行榜，有助于更全面地评估语言模型的科学推理能力。

Abstract: As language models are increasingly used in scientific workflows, evaluating
their ability to propose sets of explanations-not just a single correct
answer-becomes critical. Many scientific problems are underdetermined:
multiple, mechanistically distinct hypotheses are consistent with the same
observations. We introduce HypoSpace, a diagnostic suite that treats LLMs as
samplers of finite hypothesis sets and measures three complementary indicators:
Validity (precision of proposals consistent with observations), Uniqueness
(non-redundancy among proposals), and Recovery (coverage of the enumerated
admissible set). We instantiate HypoSpace in three structured domains with
deterministic validators and exactly enumerated hypothesis spaces: (i) causal
graphs from perturbations, (ii) gravity-constrained 3D voxel reconstruction
from top-down projections, and (iii) Boolean genetic interactions. Across
instruction-tuned and reasoning-focused models, Validity often remains high
while Uniqueness and Recovery degrade as the admissible space grows, revealing
mode collapse that is invisible to correctness-only metrics. HypoSpace offers a
controlled probe-rather than a leaderboard-for methods that explicitly explore
and cover admissible explanation spaces. Code is available at:

Result: 在文本隐式仇恨数据集上获得3个F1分数提升，在多模态仇恨表情包数据集上获得6个F1分数提升，嵌入拼接方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: 上下文信息及其融合方法对仇恨言论检测至关重要，嵌入拼接是最有效的融合策略。

Abstract: This research introduces a novel approach to textual and multimodal Hate
Speech Detection (HSD), using Large Language Models (LLMs) as dynamic knowledge
bases to generate background context and incorporate it into the input of HSD
classifiers. Two context generation strategies are examined: one focused on
named entities and the other on full-text prompting. Four methods of
incorporating context into the classifier input are compared: text
concatenation, embedding concatenation, a hierarchical transformer-based
fusion, and LLM-driven text enhancement. Experiments are conducted on the
textual Latent Hatred dataset of implicit hate speech and applied in a
multimodal setting on the MAMI dataset of misogynous memes. Results suggest
that both the contextual information and the method by which it is incorporated
are key, with gains of up to 3 and 6 F1 points on textual and multimodal setups
respectively, from a zero-context baseline to the highest-performing system,
based on embedding concatenation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态调整检索文档列表长度的检索增强推理模型，通过强化学习训练成本感知的优势函数，在保持效果的同时显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强推理模型计算成本高昂，检索和推理token都消耗大量资源，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用强化学习训练成本感知的优势函数，动态调整检索文档长度，探索内存和延迟约束下的实现方案。

Result: 在7个公开问答数据集上验证，延迟降低16-20%，准确率提升约5%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持甚至提升模型效果的同时，显著降低了计算成本，实现了效率与效果的平衡。

Abstract: Reasoning models have gained significant attention due to their strong
performance, particularly when enhanced with retrieval augmentation. However,
these models often incur high computational costs, as both retrieval and
reasoning tokens contribute substantially to the overall resource usage. In
this work, we make the following contributions: (1) we propose a
retrieval-augmented reasoning model that dynamically adjusts the length of the
retrieved document list based on the query and retrieval results; (2) we
develop a cost-aware advantage function for training of efficient
retrieval-augmented reasoning models through reinforcement learning; and (3) we
explore both memory- and latency-bound implementations of the proposed
cost-aware framework for both proximal and group relative policy optimization
algorithms. We evaluate our approach on seven public question answering
datasets and demonstrate significant efficiency gains, without compromising
effectiveness. In fact, we observed that the model latency decreases by ~16-20%
across datasets, while its effectiveness increases by ~5% on average, in terms
of exact match.

TL;DR: 对掩码扩散语言模型(DLMs)注意力模式的分析，发现其存在动态变化的注意力下沉现象，且对注意力下沉的移除具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然DLMs作为自回归模型(ARMs)的替代方案显示出潜力，但其内部工作机制尚未被充分探索，特别是注意力模式的特点。

Method: 对DLM注意力模式进行实证分析，重点关注注意力下沉现象，并与ARMs进行对比研究。

Result: DLMs存在动态变化的注意力下沉，且对注意力下沉的移除具有鲁棒性，性能仅轻微下降，这与ARMs形成鲜明对比。

Conclusion: DLMs在注意力分配和利用方式上与ARMs存在根本性差异，这为理解扩散语言模型的内部工作机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ
transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token
generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency
and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that
govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical
analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking
phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based
architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but
with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in
DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic
behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention
sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in
performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of
diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how
they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法难以捕捉现代LLM的细微、主观和开放式特性，需要更有效的评估方式。

Method: 提出自动互评框架，让LLM通过自博弈和同行评审相互评估，使用博弈论投票算法聚合评审结果，并与人类投票行为进行对比。

Result: 实证结果显示理论预测与人类评估存在收敛和分歧，揭示了互评方法的潜力和局限性。

Conclusion: 这是首个将互评、博弈论聚合和基于人类的验证相结合的工作，为LLM能力评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: Ideal or real - that is the question.In this work, we explore whether
principles from game theory can be effectively applied to the evaluation of
large language models (LLMs). This inquiry is motivated by the growing
inadequacy of conventional evaluation practices, which often rely on
fixed-format tasks with reference answers and struggle to capture the nuanced,
subjective, and open-ended nature of modern LLM behavior. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel alternative: automatic mutual evaluation, where
LLMs assess each other's output through self-play and peer review. These peer
assessments are then systematically compared with human voting behavior to
evaluate their alignment with human judgment. Our framework incorporates
game-theoretic voting algorithms to aggregate peer reviews, enabling a
principled investigation into whether model-generated rankings reflect human
preferences. Empirical results reveal both convergences and divergences between
theoretical predictions and human evaluations, offering valuable insights into
the promises and limitations of mutual evaluation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to jointly integrate mutual evaluation,
game-theoretic aggregation, and human-grounded validation for evaluating the
capabilities of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在没有参考翻译的情况下如何验证AI翻译器（如鲸语翻译器）的有效性问题，避免与动物交互带来的安全、伦理和成本问题。

Method: 使用逐段翻译结合经典NLP shuffle测试，通过比较顺序翻译和乱序翻译的合理性来评估翻译质量，识别幻觉翻译。

Result: 在数据稀缺的人类语言和构造语言上的概念验证实验表明，该方法与基于参考翻译的标准评估高度相关。

Conclusion: 交互在翻译学习早期阶段可能不是必要或高效的，仅通过输出文本就能有效评估翻译器质量。

Abstract: If you had an AI Whale-to-English translator, how could you validate whether
or not it is working? Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on
grounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and
proof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even
observations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may
be able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering
potential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance
of machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference
translations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,''
false translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using
segment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to
evaluate translators. The idea is to translate animal communication, turn by
turn, and evaluate how often the resulting translations make more sense in
order than permuted. Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human
languages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this
evaluation methodology. These human-language experiments serve solely to
validate our reference-free metric under data scarcity. It is found to
correlate highly with a standard evaluation based on reference translations,
which are available in our experiments. We also perform a theoretical analysis
suggesting that interaction may not be necessary nor efficient in the early
stages of learning to translate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明大语言模型存在真假陈述的线性分离子空间，但其产生机制尚不明确。本文旨在通过构建透明模型来揭示这种线性真值表示的具体产生路径。

Method: 构建单层transformer玩具模型，研究在事实陈述共现的数据分布下，模型如何学习真假区分以降低语言建模损失，并在预训练语言模型中进行实验验证。

Result: 模型成功重现了真假子空间分离现象，观察到两阶段学习动态：先快速记忆个体事实关联，后长时间学习线性分离真假陈述，从而降低语言建模损失。

Conclusion: 研究提供了线性真值表示在语言模型中产生的机制性证明和实证动机，解释了真假子空间分离现象的具体产生路径。

Abstract: Recent probing studies reveal that large language models exhibit linear
subspaces that separate true from false statements, yet the mechanism behind
their emergence is unclear. We introduce a transparent, one-layer transformer
toy model that reproduces such truth subspaces end-to-end and exposes one
concrete route by which they can arise. We study one simple setting in which
truth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements
co-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model
to learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We
corroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models.
Finally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks
first memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then -- over a
longer horizon -- learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn
lowers language-modeling loss. Together, these results provide both a
mechanistic demonstration and an empirical motivation for how and why linear
truth representations can emerge in language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法（如直接LLM生成、模板或HTML转换）难以生成布局感知的交互式网站，且缺乏全面的评估套件。

Method: 提出Paper2Web基准数据集，包含基于规则的指标（连通性、完整性）、人类验证的LLM-as-a-Judge评估（交互性、美观性、信息性）和PaperQuiz（知识保留度）。并开发PWAgent自主管道，通过MCP工具迭代优化内容和布局。

Result: PWAgent在学术网页生成任务中显著优于端到端基线方法（如基于模板的网页和arXiv/alphaXiv版本），同时保持低成本，达到帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: Paper2Web为学术网页生成提供了全面的评估框架，PWAgent能够高效地将科学论文转换为高质量的交互式学术主页。

Abstract: Academic project websites can more effectively disseminate research when they
clearly present core content and enable intuitive navigation and interaction.
However, current approaches such as direct Large Language Model (LLM)
generation, templates, or direct HTML conversion struggle to produce
layout-aware, interactive sites, and a comprehensive evaluation suite for this
task has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce Paper2Web, a benchmark
dataset and multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing academic
webpage generation. It incorporates rule-based metrics like Connectivity,
Completeness and human-verified LLM-as-a-Judge (covering interactivity,
aesthetics, and informativeness), and PaperQuiz, which measures paper-level
knowledge retention. We further present PWAgent, an autonomous pipeline that
converts scientific papers into interactive and multimedia-rich academic
homepages. The agent iteratively refines both content and layout through MCP
tools that enhance emphasis, balance, and presentation quality. Our experiments
show that PWAgent consistently outperforms end-to-end baselines like
template-based webpages and arXiv/alphaXiv versions by a large margin while
maintaining low cost, achieving the Pareto-front in academic webpage
generation.

Method: 采用混合词典-模糊-Transformer框架，结合基于规则的启发式方法、上下文深度学习和模糊逻辑，通过VADER初始估计、DistilBERT置信度调整和模糊推理系统生成连续情感分数。

Result: 在四个领域特定数据集（外卖、电商、旅游、时尚）上的评估显示，与用户评分对齐度提高，能更好识别情感极端值，减少误分类。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了将符号推理与神经模型相结合在语言动态领域中进行可解释、细粒度情感分析的价值。

Abstract: Accurately detecting sentiment polarity and intensity in product reviews and
social media posts remains challenging due to informal and domain-specific
language. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer
framework that combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and
fuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores reflecting both polarity
and strength. The pipeline begins with VADER-based initial sentiment
estimations, which are refined through a two-stage adjustment process. This
involves leveraging confidence scores from DistilBERT, a lightweight
transformer and applying fuzzy logic principles to mitigate excessive
neutrality bias and enhance granularity. A custom fuzzy inference system then
maps the refined scores onto a 0 to 1 continuum, producing expert)like
judgments. The framework is rigorously evaluated on four domain-specific
datasets. food delivery, e-commerce, tourism, and fashion. Results show
improved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment
extremes, and reduced misclassifications. Both quantitative metrics
(distributional alignment, confusion matrices) and qualitative insights (case
studies, runtime analysis) affirm the models robustness and efficiency. This
work demonstrates the value of integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
models for interpretable, finegrained sentiment analysis in linguistically
dynamic domains.

Result: 每种改进措施都显著提升了性能，缩小了与上界结果的差距。

Conclusion: 研究为利用这些新兴模型提供了实践挑战的解决方案和实证指导，展示了语音大语言模型在槽位填充任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Slot filling is a crucial subtask in spoken language understanding (SLU),
traditionally implemented as a cascade of speech recognition followed by one or
more natural language understanding (NLU) components. The recent advent of
speech-based large language models (speechLLMs), which integrate speech and
textual foundation models, has opened new avenues for achieving speech
understanding tasks in a more unified, generative, and instruction-following
manner while promising data and compute efficiency with zero-shot abilities,
generalizing to unseen slot labels. We address the slot-filling task by
creating an empirical upper bound for the task, identifying performance,
robustness, and generalization gaps, and proposing improvements to the training
data, architecture, and training strategies to narrow the gap with the upper
bound result. We show that each of these measures improve performance
substantially, while highlighting practical challenges and providing empirical
guidance and insights for harnessing these emerging models.

TL;DR: ORBIT框架通过基于量规的增量强化学习，在开放式医学对话任务中显著提升了LLM性能，在HealthBench-Hard基准上从7.0提升到27.2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在数学、代码等有明确奖励函数的领域表现良好，但在开放式领域如医学咨询中缺乏有效的奖励机制，限制了LLM在这些高风险任务中的应用。

Method: 提出ORBIT框架，结合合成对话生成和动态量规创建，使用量规指导的反馈进行增量强化学习，不依赖外部医学知识或手动规则。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B-Instruct模型上，仅使用2k样本就将HealthBench-Hard基准性能从7.0提升到27.2，达到同类规模模型的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 量规驱动的强化学习为复杂开放式任务中的LLM提供了一种可扩展的策略，能够促进跨多种咨询场景的一致性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be
programmatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models
benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based
objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in
open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or
context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably
medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas
challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT,
an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed
for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue
generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to
direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend
on external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided
feedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model,
our method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard
benchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving
state-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that
rubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse
consultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These
findings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing
LLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks.

Motivation: 现有技能学习方法往往创建过度专门化于单一网站的技能，缺乏泛化能力。需要开发能够学习通用且可组合技能的方法。

Method: 受软件工程中多态性启发，PolySkill框架将技能的抽象目标（做什么）与具体实现（怎么做）解耦，使智能体能够识别和精炼自身目标。

Result: 在已见网站上技能重用率提高1.7倍；在Mind2Web和未见网站上成功率分别提升9.4%和13.9%，同时减少20%以上的步骤；在自探索设置中提高了任务提议质量。

Conclusion: 将技能目标与执行分离是开发能够在开放网络中持续学习和泛化的自主智能体的关键步骤，为实现适应性环境中的持续学习提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are moving beyond static uses and are now
powering agents that learn continually during their interaction with external
environments. For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating
web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning
often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to
generalize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to
learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by
polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal
(what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed).
Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen
websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on
unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration
settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of
proposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work
across different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own
goals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum,
leading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline
methods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of
continual learning in adaptive environments. Our findings show that separating
a skill's goal from its execution is a crucial step toward developing
autonomous agents that can learn and generalize across the open web
continuously.

Abstract: We present SQuAI (https://squai.scads.ai/), a scalable and trustworthy
multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for scientific
question answering (QA) with large language models (LLMs). SQuAI addresses key
limitations of existing RAG systems in the scholarly domain, where complex,

million full-text papers from arXiv.org, SQuAI employs four collaborative
agents to decompose complex questions into sub-questions, retrieve targeted
evidence via hybrid sparse-dense retrieval, and adaptively filter documents to
improve contextual relevance. To ensure faithfulness and traceability, SQuAI
integrates in-line citations for each generated claim and provides supporting
sentences from the source documents. Our system improves faithfulness, answer
relevance, and contextual relevance by up to +0.088 (12%) over a strong RAG

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning and text generation
capabilities, prompting their use in scientific literature analysis, including
novelty assessment. While evaluating novelty of scientific papers is crucial
for peer review, it requires extensive knowledge of related work, something not
all reviewers have. While recent work on LLM-assisted scientific literature
analysis supports literature comparison, existing approaches offer limited
transparency and lack mechanisms for result traceability via an information
retrieval module. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{GraphMind}$, an
easy-to-use interactive web tool designed to assist users in evaluating the
novelty of scientific papers or drafted ideas. Specially, $\textbf{GraphMind}$
enables users to capture the main structure of a scientific paper, explore
related ideas through various perspectives, and assess novelty via providing
verifiable contextual insights. $\textbf{GraphMind}$ enables users to annotate
key elements of a paper, explore related papers through various relationships,
and assess novelty with contextual insight. This tool integrates external APIs
such as arXiv and Semantic Scholar with LLMs to support annotation, extraction,
retrieval and classification of papers. This combination provides users with a

TL;DR: MAGPIE是一个新的多智能体隐私评估基准，包含200个高风险任务，用于评估多智能体协作场景中的隐私理解和保护能力。研究发现当前最先进的LLM智能体存在显著的隐私泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私基准只关注简单的单轮交互，无法评估复杂协作环境中隐私保护与任务效能之间的平衡。需要开发更真实的评估框架来测试智能体在必须使用隐私信息完成任务时的表现。

Method: 开发了MAGPIE基准，包含200个高风险任务，其中隐私信息是任务解决的必要要素，迫使智能体在有效协作与战略信息控制之间取得平衡。

Result: GPT-5和Gemini 2.5-Pro等先进智能体存在显著隐私泄露，Gemini 2.5-Pro泄露高达50.7%的敏感信息，GPT-5泄露35.1%。智能体还难以达成共识或完成任务，经常出现操纵和权力寻求等不良行为。

Conclusion: 当前LLM智能体缺乏稳健的隐私理解能力，在复杂环境中无法同时实现隐私保护和有效协作，需要进一步改进对齐策略。

Abstract: A core challenge for autonomous LLM agents in collaborative settings is
balancing robust privacy understanding and preservation alongside task
efficacy. Existing privacy benchmarks only focus on simplistic, single-turn
interactions where private information can be trivially omitted without
affecting task outcomes. In this paper, we introduce MAGPIE (Multi-AGent
contextual PrIvacy Evaluation), a novel benchmark of 200 high-stakes tasks
designed to evaluate privacy understanding and preservation in multi-agent
collaborative, non-adversarial scenarios. MAGPIE integrates private information
as essential for task resolution, forcing agents to balance effective
collaboration with strategic information control. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art agents, including GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5-Pro, exhibit
significant privacy leakage, with Gemini 2.5-Pro leaking up to 50.7% and GPT-5
up to 35.1% of the sensitive information even when explicitly instructed not
to. Moreover, these agents struggle to achieve consensus or task completion and
often resort to undesirable behaviors such as manipulation and power-seeking
(e.g., Gemini 2.5-Pro demonstrating manipulation in 38.2% of the cases). These
findings underscore that current LLM agents lack robust privacy understanding
and are not yet adequately aligned to simultaneously preserve privacy and
maintain effective collaboration in complex environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了覆盖度(coverage)的概念来解释预训练语言模型在下游任务中的表现，发现覆盖度比交叉熵能更好地预测下游性能，并揭示了覆盖度原理的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然预训练语言模型在特定任务上表现出色，但预训练如何影响最终模型成功的原因仍不清楚。交叉熵损失不能很好地预测下游性能，需要新的理论视角。

Method: 从覆盖度的理论视角分析预训练模型，研究覆盖度原理的机制，并提出了三种改进覆盖度的算法干预方法：模型/检查点选择、梯度归一化方案和测试时解码策略。

Result: 发现覆盖度比交叉熵能更快地泛化，避免了序列长度等问题相关参数的虚假依赖，覆盖度是后训练和测试时缩放方法成功的必要且充分条件。

Conclusion: 覆盖度原理解释了预训练模型在下游任务中的成功，覆盖度是比交叉熵更好的性能预测指标，提出的算法干预方法可有效提升覆盖度。

Abstract: Language models demonstrate remarkable abilities when pre-trained on large
text corpora and fine-tuned for specific tasks, but how and why pre-training
shapes the success of the final model remains poorly understood. Notably,
although pre-training success is often quantified by cross entropy loss,
cross-entropy can be a poor predictor of downstream performance. Instead, we
provide a theoretical perspective on this relationship through the lens of
\emph{coverage}, which quantifies the probability mass the pre-trained model
places on high-quality responses and which is necessary and sufficient for
post-training and test-time scaling methods such as Best-of-N to succeed. Our
main results develop an understanding of \emph{the coverage principle}, a
phenomenon whereby next-token prediction implicitly optimizes toward a model
with good coverage. In particular, we uncover a mechanism that explains the
power of coverage in predicting downstream performance: \emph{coverage
generalizes faster than cross entropy}, avoiding spurious dependence on
problem-dependent parameters such as the sequence length. We also study
practical algorithmic interventions with provable benefits for improving
coverage, including (i) model/checkpoint selection procedures, (ii) gradient
normalization schemes, and (iii) test-time decoding strategies.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型主要模拟群体共识，缺乏对个体推理风格和信念轨迹的个性化捕捉，需要开发能够适应个体推理模式的AI系统。

Method: 采用双轨设计：合成轨道用于规模化和系统性压力测试，人类轨道用于生态有效的"出声思考"推理数据收集。

Result: 实验表明最先进的LLMs在个体适应方面存在持续差距，HugAgent成为首个可扩展的机器推理与人类个体思维对齐基准。

Conclusion: HugAgent为评估机器推理的个体化适应能力提供了首个可扩展基准，推动了AI向更人性化推理的发展。

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as
HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型生成的科学协议往往不完整或不一致，限制了其在可重复科学研究中的实用性。

Method: 引入SciRecipe数据集，提出"草图-填充"范式分离分析、结构和表达，采用结构化组件奖励机制评估步骤粒度、动作顺序和语义保真度，并通过分阶段的知识到行动过程训练Thoth模型。

Result: Thoth在多个基准测试中持续超越专有和开源LLM，在步骤对齐、逻辑排序和语义准确性方面取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠的科学助手铺平了道路，能够有效连接知识与实验执行。

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for
science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed
workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context
management that hinders long-horizon research. We present
\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring
\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a
\coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --
users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific
requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including
\textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication}
to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across
sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These
features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run
attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on
prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the
architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable
co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of
automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy
interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --

Abstract: In quantitative investing, return prediction supports various tasks,
including stock selection, portfolio optimization, and risk management.
Quantitative factors, such as valuation, quality, and growth, capture various
characteristics of stocks. Unstructured financial data, like news and
transcripts, has attracted growing attention, driven by recent advances in
large language models (LLMs). This paper examines effective methods for
leveraging multimodal factors and newsflow in return prediction and stock
selection. First, we introduce a fusion learning framework to learn a unified
representation from factors and newsflow representations generated by an LLM.
Within this framework, we compare three representative methods: representation
combination, representation summation, and attentive representations. Next,
building on empirical observations from fusion learning, we explore the mixture
model that adaptively combines predictions made by single modalities and their
fusion. To mitigate the training instability observed in the mixture model, we
introduce a decoupled training approach with theoretical insights. Finally, our
experiments on real investment universes yield several insights into effective
multimodal modeling of factors and news for stock return prediction.

TL;DR: SPA框架通过自监督微调学习世界模型，然后用于策略优化，显著提升LLM智能体在分布外环境中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在分布外环境中表现不佳，难以将内部知识与环境动态对齐，导致探索脆弱和泛化能力有限

Method: 将世界模型分解为状态表示和转移建模，通过自博弈监督微调阶段冷启动策略，学习世界模型后用于模拟未来状态进行策略优化

Result: 在Sokoban、FrozenLake和Sudoku等环境中显著提升性能，如Sokoban成功率从25.6%提升到59.8%，FrozenLake得分从22.1%提升到70.9%

Conclusion: 为LLM智能体配备内部世界模型能更好地对齐推理与环境动态，改善决策能力，SPA框架有效提升了RL训练效果

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

TL;DR: 提出了Antislop框架，通过采样器、自动化流水线和新型微调方法FTPO来检测和消除LLM输出中的重复模式（slop），在保持性能的同时显著减少slop。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM广泛采用导致输出中出现特征性的重复短语模式（slop），这会降低输出质量并使AI生成文本容易被识别。需要开发工具来检测和消除这些过度使用的模式。

Method: 结合三种创新方法：(1) Antislop采样器使用回溯在推理时抑制不需要的字符串；(2) 自动化流水线分析模型特定的slop并生成训练数据；(3) 最终令牌偏好优化(FTPO)，一种在单个令牌上操作的微调方法。

Result: 某些slop模式在LLM输出中比人类文本出现频率高1000倍以上。Antislop采样器成功抑制8000+模式，而令牌禁止在2000个模式时已不可用。FTPO实现了90%的slop减少，同时在GSM8K、MMLU和创意写作任务中保持或改善性能。

Conclusion: Antislop框架有效解决了LLM输出中的slop问题，FTPO方法在保持模型性能的同时显著减少重复模式，优于DPO方法。

Abstract: Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology,
termed ``slop,'' which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text
immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework
providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results

TL;DR: DLER通过改进强化学习优化方法，使用简单的截断长度惩罚，在保持高准确率的同时大幅缩短推理语言模型的输出长度，实现了最先进的准确率-效率权衡。


<details>

Motivation: 现有推理语言模型虽然性能强大，但生成了不必要的冗长输出，需要解决最大化每个token的智能（准确率相对于响应长度）的问题。

Method: 提出DLER训练方法，结合批量奖励归一化、更高裁剪、动态采样和简单截断长度惩罚，解决了强化学习优化中的三个关键挑战：优势估计偏差大、熵崩溃和稀疏奖励信号。

Result: DLER将输出长度减少超过70%，同时超越了所有先前基线的准确率。DLER-7B相比DeepSeek-R1-7B生成多个简洁响应，准确率提高28%，延迟更低。

Conclusion: DLER证明了通过改进强化学习优化而非复杂惩罚机制，可以有效实现推理语言模型的简洁化，并提出了难度感知DLER和更新选择性合并方法以进一步提升效率。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

Conclusion: FinTrust可作为金融领域LLM可信度评估的有价值基准，当前LLM在金融法律意识方面仍有显著差距。

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related

challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper
introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark
focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and
features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.
We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a
valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示搜索方法在分布漂移和对抗评估下性能下降，因为它们只优化单一评估分布下的期望性能

Method: 将零样本提示优化构建为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，使用f-散度球定义评估分布周围的模糊集，通过鲁棒采集规则最大化最坏情况期望效用

Result: 在形式化改写任务中准确率从61.3%提升至85-90%，代码调试在领域漂移下提升约25个百分点，稳定任务保持96%以上性能

Conclusion: DRO-InstructZero将分布鲁棒优化与提示学习结合，为现实世界不确定性下的可靠、可迁移提示对齐提供了即插即用的通用方法

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications are blindfolded to the infrastructure

extensive training data, Shakti models leverage architectural innovations to
attain competitive results with fewer tokens. Key advancements include
QK-Normalization for attention stability, hybrid normalization techniques, and
enhanced positional encoding. A three-stage training strategy further optimizes
learning efficiency. Evaluations show that Shakti-Shakti-VLM-1B and
Shakti-VLM-4B excel in document understanding, Visual Reasoning, OCR
extraction, and general multimodal reasoning. Our results highlight that high
performance can be achieved through model design and training strategy rather
than sheer data volume, making Shakti an efficient solution for
enterprise-scale multimodal tasks.

TL;DR: DeLeaker是一种轻量级、无需优化的推理时方法，通过直接干预模型的注意力图来减轻语义泄漏问题，在保持图像质量的同时有效抑制跨实体交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型存在语义泄漏问题，即不同实体之间意外传递语义相关特征，现有缓解策略通常基于优化或依赖外部输入。

Method: DeLeaker在扩散过程中动态重新加权注意力图，抑制过度的跨实体交互，同时增强每个实体的身份特征。

Result: 实验表明DeLeaker在所有基线方法中表现最佳，即使基线方法使用外部信息，DeLeaker也能在保持保真度和质量的同时有效缓解泄漏。

Conclusion: 注意力控制对于实现更语义精确的文本到图像模型具有重要价值，DeLeaker为这一方向铺平了道路。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

TL;DR: COGS是一个数据高效框架，通过将种子问题分解为感知和推理因子，然后系统重组生成大量合成问答对，为多模态大语言模型提供高级推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在缺乏大规模人工标注推理数据的人工图像领域（如图表、文档、网页）中的推理能力限制问题。

Method: 将每个种子问题分解为原始感知和推理因子，然后与新的图像系统重组生成合成问答对，每个问题都配有子问题和中间答案，支持因子级过程奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在图表推理实验中，COGS显著提高了未见问题的性能，特别是在推理密集和组合性问题上的提升最大。使用不同种子数据的因子级混合训练能在多个数据集上实现更好的迁移。

Conclusion: COGS框架能够诱导出可泛化的能力而非数据集特定的过拟合，并且可以扩展到图表之外的其他领域如网页。

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

TL;DR: 提出UniFilter作为统一多模态数据质量分类器，用于过滤高质量的图像-文本描述数据和交错文档数据，通过半合成方法生成训练数据，显著提升MLLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像-文本描述数据和交错文档数据上持续预训练，但高质量图像-文本交错文档数据的过滤方法研究不足。

Method: 采用半合成方法，利用原始图像生成四种质量等级的对应文本，创建样本-分数对来训练UniFilter分类器，用于过滤DataComp和OBELICS数据集。

Result: 在过滤数据上预训练的MLLM展现出显著增强的零样本推理和上下文学习能力，视觉监督微调后在多个基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: UniFilter能够有效提升多模态预训练数据质量，带来下游任务性能增益，并发布了相关数据和模型供社区使用。

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to
the community for reproduction and further development.

TL;DR: OmniVinci是一个开源的多模态大语言模型，通过创新的架构设计和数据管理，在跨模态理解、音频和视觉任务上表现优异，训练数据量仅为竞争模型的1/6。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推进机器智能需要发展跨多模态的感知能力，模仿人类感知世界的方式。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：OmniAlignNet增强视觉和音频嵌入的对齐；Temporal Embedding Grouping捕捉相对时间对齐；Constrained Rotary Time Embedding编码绝对时间信息。构建了2400万单模态和多模态对话的数据合成管道。

Result: OmniVinci在DailyOmni（跨模态理解）上比Qwen2.5-Omni高19.05分，在MMAR（音频）上高1.7分，在Video-MME（视觉）上高3.9分，仅使用0.2T训练token，是Qwen2.5-Omni的1/6。

Conclusion: 多模态在感知和推理中相互增强，模型在机器人、医疗AI和智能工厂等下游应用中展现出多模态优势。

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive
across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce
OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to
Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream
applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly leveraged for
generating both traditional software code and spreadsheet logic. Despite their
impressive generative capabilities, these models frequently exhibit critical
issues such as hallucinations, subtle logical inconsistencies, and syntactic
errors, risks particularly acute in high stakes domains like financial
modelling and scientific computations, where accuracy and reliability are
paramount. This position paper proposes a structured research framework that
integrates the proven software engineering practice of Test-Driven Development
(TDD) with Large Language Model (LLM) driven generation to enhance the
correctness of, reliability of, and user confidence in generated outputs. We
hypothesise that a "test first" methodology provides both technical constraints
and cognitive scaffolding, guiding LLM outputs towards more accurate,
verifiable, and comprehensible solutions. Our framework, applicable across
diverse programming contexts, from spreadsheet formula generation to scripting
languages such as Python and strongly typed languages like Rust, includes an
explicitly outlined experimental design with clearly defined participant
groups, evaluation metrics, and illustrative TDD based prompting examples. By
emphasising test driven thinking, we aim to improve computational thinking,
prompt engineering skills, and user engagement, particularly benefiting
spreadsheet users who often lack formal programming training yet face serious
consequences from logical errors. We invite collaboration to refine and
empirically evaluate this approach, ultimately aiming to establish responsible
and reliable LLM integration in both educational and professional development
practices.
