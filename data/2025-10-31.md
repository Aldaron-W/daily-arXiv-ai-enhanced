### [1] [StreetMath: Study of LLMs' Approximation Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25776)
*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究引入StreetMath基准来评估LLM在现实近似场景下的近似推理能力，发现LLM倾向于计算精确值而非近似推理，且近似与精确算术依赖不同神经组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在精确算术运算上的表现，但在非正式、快速近似推理方面的能力研究不足，特别是非自回归解码器模型。

Method: 引入StreetMath基准，在不同LLM架构上进行评估，并应用机制可解释性技术分析内部计算状态。

Result: LLM通常尝试计算精确值或调用外部工具，即使在需要近似的任务中；近似与精确算术依赖不同的神经组件；LLM未表现出人类在街头数学中的认知吝啬性。

Conclusion: LLM在近似推理方面存在局限，与人类认知方式不同，需要进一步研究如何提升其近似计算能力。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

### [2] [Review Based Entity Ranking using Fuzzy Logic Algorithmic Approach: Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25778)
*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模糊逻辑和句法依赖解析的细粒度情感分析方法，能够对实体评论进行情感强度和方向的分类排序


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于词典的情感分析方法无法考虑情感强度，无法区分非常强烈、强烈、中等、非常弱和弱等不同强度的情感

Method: 结合模糊逻辑算法将观点词分类到不同类别，使用句法依赖解析找到与目标方面词的关系，考虑与特定方面相关的观点词来计算实体评分

Result: 能够对实体评论进行细粒度的情感强度分类，实现基于情感方向和强度的实体排序

Conclusion: 该方法能够更准确地分析用户对实体不同方面的情感强度和方向，为基于情感分析的实体排序提供了更精确的解决方案

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

### [3] [LASTIST: LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25783)
*DongJae Kim,Yaejin Lee,Minsu Park,Eunil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个大规模目标无关立场检测数据集LASTIST，包含563,299个带标签的韩语句子，旨在解决韩语等低资源语言在立场检测领域的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前立场检测研究主要集中在目标依赖任务上，且大多数基准数据集基于英语，难以在韩语等低资源语言中开发模型，特别是在立场检测这一新兴领域。

Method: 从韩国政党的新闻稿中收集数据，构建了包含563,299个带标签韩语句子的LASTIST数据集，并训练了最先进的深度学习和立场检测模型。

Result: 成功创建了适用于多种立场检测任务的大规模韩语数据集，包括目标无关立场检测和历时演化立场检测。

Conclusion: LASTIST数据集填补了韩语立场检测领域的研究空白，为低资源语言的立场检测研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LASTIST-3721/.

### [4] [zFLoRA: Zero-Latency Fused Low-Rank Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25784)
*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出zFLoRA，一种零延迟的融合低秩适配器，在基础模型上引入零或可忽略的延迟开销，解决了现有适配器在推理时计算开销过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型部署时使用任务特定的适配器，虽然适配器参数很少（通常少于基础模型的1%），但在推理时会产生不成比例的计算开销（最高可达基础模型的2.5倍）。

Method: 提出零延迟融合低秩适配器（zFLoRA），通过融合技术消除适配器带来的额外延迟。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的LLM上，zFLoRA在常识推理、数学推理和摘要对话等18个任务上表现优于流行的监督微调基准，包括LoRA和全微调。在NPU和GPU平台上测量显示延迟开销为零或可忽略。

Conclusion: zFLoRA是一种有效的适配器方法，能够在保持性能的同时消除推理延迟开销。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

*Yaniv Nikankin,Dana Arad,Itay Itzhak,Anja Reusch,Adi Simhi,Gal Kesten-Pomeranz,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了三种改进电路发现的方法：使用自举法识别一致归因边、引入比率选择策略、用整数线性规划替代贪婪选择，在MIB基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机制可解释性中电路发现的主要挑战，即确定模型中执行特定任务的部分，改进现有的Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark。

Method: 1. 使用自举法识别具有一致归因分数的边；2. 引入基于比率的简单选择策略，优先考虑强正分数边；3. 用整数线性规划替换标准贪婪选择方法。

Result: 生成的电路更加忠实，在多个MIB任务和模型上优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的三种改进方法有效提升了电路发现的性能和忠实度，代码已开源。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

### [6] [LISTEN to Your Preferences: An LLM Framework for Multi-Objective Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25799)
*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LISTEN框架使用大型语言模型作为零样本偏好预测器，通过自然语言指导专家在多目标决策中选择最佳选项，包含参数化（LISTEN-U）和非参数化（LISTEN-T）两种迭代算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专家在多个竞争目标下从大量选项中做出选择时的困难，特别是难以形式化复杂、隐含偏好的问题。

Method: 提出LISTEN框架，使用LLM作为零样本偏好预测器，包含两种算法：LISTEN-U通过LLM精炼参数化效用函数，LISTEN-T使用锦标赛式选择在小批量解决方案中进行非参数化选择。

Result: 在航班预订、购物和考试安排等多样化任务上的评估显示，当偏好参数对齐时LISTEN-U表现优异，而LISTEN-T提供更稳健的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作探索了用自然语言直接指导复杂多目标决策的有前景方向，减轻了传统偏好获取的认知负担。

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

### [7] [Beyond Length: Quantifying Long-Range Information for Long-Context LLM Pretraining Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25804)
*Haoran Deng,Yingyu Lin,Zhenghao Lin,Xiao Liu,Yizhou Sun,Yi-An Ma,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongFilter框架通过对比模型在长上下文和短上下文设置下的预测差异，识别具有重要长距离依赖的训练数据，有效提升长上下文预训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长文本数据中大部分缺乏有意义的远距离依赖关系，仅使用局部上下文即可预测，导致训练效率低下，需要精心筛选数据。

Method: 提出LongFilter框架，通过对比模型在长上下文和短上下文设置下的预测差异来量化扩展上下文带来的信息增益，从而识别需要长距离依赖的样本。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B模型上将上下文长度从8K扩展到64K，实验表明LongFilter能高效选择高质量数据，在HELMET、LongBench和RULER等基准测试上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: LongFilter为长上下文预训练提供了有效的数据筛选方法，通过识别真正需要长距离依赖的样本，显著提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

### [8] [Ideology-Based LLMs for Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25805)
*Stefano Civelli,Pietro Bernardelle,Nardiena A. Pratama,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，角色设定会影响大语言模型在有害内容分类中的公平性和一致性，导致意识形态偏见，即使总体准确率变化不大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保内容审核系统中大语言模型的公平性和中立性，研究角色设定如何影响模型对有害内容的判断。

Method: 通过不同角色设定测试多种LLM架构、模型大小和内容模态，分析角色对有害内容分类的影响，并进行一致性分析和政治倾向任务验证。

Result: 角色设定导致不同意识形态倾向的模型在有害内容判定上出现差异，大模型更倾向于与同意识形态角色保持一致，强化内部一致性但加剧跨意识形态分歧。

Conclusion: 角色设定会在LLM输出中引入微妙的意识形态偏见，对伪装中立的AI系统使用提出警示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

### [9] [Beyond Long Context: When Semantics Matter More than Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25816)
*Tarun Kumar Chawdhury,Jon D. Duke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR方法通过实体感知检索在临床问答中实现F1分数0.90，比基于嵌入的检索高0.04，同时减少70%以上的token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床文档以base64编码附件形式存储，使得语义问答变得困难，传统向量数据库方法常错过细微的临床关系。

Method: 开发了临床笔记问答评估平台，验证CLEAR方法对抗零样本大上下文推理和传统分块检索增强生成。使用12个临床笔记进行测试，范围从10,000到65,000个token。

Result: CLEAR获得58.3%的胜率，平均语义相似度0.878，比宽上下文处理少用78%的token。在超过65,000个token的长文档上表现最佳，胜率达75%。

Conclusion: 实体感知检索提高了临床自然语言处理的效率和准确性。评估框架为评估临床问答系统提供了可重用和透明的基准，其中语义精度和计算效率至关重要。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估LLM在FrameNet语义标注中的表现，比较手动、自动和半自动三种设置，发现半自动设置能提高框架多样性，而纯自动设置除标注时间外表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM工具在语言资源创建中潜力巨大，但对其在标注数据集中的性能和影响缺乏全面评估，特别是在视角化NLP方法下。

Method: 采用三种实验设置比较标注时间、覆盖率和多样性：手动标注、自动标注（使用LLM语义角色标注器）和半自动标注。

Result: 半自动标注设置相比纯人工设置提高了框架多样性且保持相似标注覆盖率，而自动设置在除标注时间外的所有指标上都表现明显较差。

Conclusion: 半自动标注方法在语义标注任务中具有优势，能够平衡效率和质量，而纯自动方法在质量方面仍有不足。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

*André V. Duarte,Xuying li,Bin Zeng,Arlindo L. Oliveira,Lei Li,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP是一个用于从大型语言模型中提取和验证记忆训练数据的代理流程，通过反馈驱动的循环和越狱模块显著提高了提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当无法检查大型语言模型的训练数据时，需要一种方法来确认模型是否见过特定内容，最有力的证据是模型能够自由重现目标内容。

Method: RECAP采用反馈驱动循环：初始提取尝试由次级语言模型评估，识别与参考段落的差异，生成最小修正提示反馈给目标模型进行后续生成，并包含检测和克服对齐拒绝的越狱模块。

Result: 在EchoTrace基准测试中，RECAP相比单次迭代方法有显著提升，GPT-4.1提取受版权保护文本的ROUGE-L得分从0.38提高到0.47，增长近24%。

Conclusion: RECAP通过反馈驱动的迭代提取和越狱机制，能够有效激发和验证LLM中记忆的训练数据，为模型训练数据审计提供了有效工具。

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究挑战了多语言预训练中的常见假设，发现在1.1B和3B参数规模下，增加语言数量不会导致性能下降，英语作为枢纽语言能跨语系带来益处，且适当平衡的多语言数据能增强模型能力而不损害性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言数据混合对大型语言模型预训练的影响，特别是关于语言覆盖与模型性能之间权衡的争议（即多语言诅咒问题）。

Method: 训练1.1B和3B参数的LLM，使用不同的多语言语料库，语言数量从25到400种不等，研究英语作为枢纽语言的作用。

Result: 发现英语和多语言数据结合不会降低任何语言组的性能；英语作为枢纽语言能跨语系带来益处；在此规模下未观察到明显的多语言诅咒现象。

Conclusion: 适当平衡的多语言数据可以增强语言模型能力，而不会损害性能，即使在低资源环境下也是如此。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 机器翻译在低资源语言中生成合成数据时，由于文化差异会导致语义标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域。研究发现LLMs编码文化知识会放大这种漂移，文化相似性是标签保持的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器翻译中文化对齐对语义标签保持的影响，现有研究忽视了文化差异在翻译过程中的作用，特别是在文化敏感领域可能导致的标签漂移问题。

Method: 通过跨文化敏感领域和中性领域的一系列实验，比较不同机器翻译系统（包括现代LLMs）在翻译过程中的标签漂移情况，分析文化相似性对标签保持的影响。

Result: 发现：(1)机器翻译系统（包括LLMs）在翻译过程中会导致标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域；(2)LLMs编码的文化知识会放大标签漂移；(3)源语言和目标语言之间的文化相似性是标签保持的关键决定因素。

Conclusion: 忽视机器翻译中的文化因素不仅会削弱标签保真度，还会在下游应用中导致误解和文化冲突的风险。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in

### [15] [SymCode: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Mathematical Reasoning via Verifiable Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25975)
*Sina Bagheri Nezhad,Yao Li,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SymCode是一个神经符号框架，将数学问题解决重构为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，显著提高了LLM在数学推理中的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中表现不佳，基于文本的生成方法产生未经验证且算术上不可靠的解决方案，当前提示策略缺乏确定性验证机制。

Method: 引入SymCode神经符号框架，将数学问题解决重构为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，将LLM推理基于确定性符号引擎。

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench等挑战性基准测试中，相比基线方法准确率提升高达13.6个百分点，不仅更token高效，还将模型失败从模糊的逻辑谬误转变为透明的程序化错误。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM推理基于确定性符号引擎，SymCode代表了在形式化领域实现更准确和可信赖AI的关键一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对AWS Trainium AI加速器，设计了高性能的矩阵乘法内核，通过内核融合和新型缓存策略优化LLM推理性能，相比AWS现有实现平均提升1.35倍（最高2.22倍）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trainium AI加速器虽然为AI工作负载提供了成本效益和高性能解决方案，但其脉动阵列架构和数据布局特殊要求使得实现高性能具有挑战性，特别是在LLM推理中的关键计算内核矩阵乘法方面。

Method: 基于内核融合和新型缓存策略，针对Trainium架构定制化设计，减少软件管理内存层次结构中的数据移动，最大化SRAM带宽，避免昂贵的矩阵转置操作。

Result: 在9个数据集和4个最新LLM上的评估显示，矩阵乘法内核平均提速1.35倍（最高2.22倍），端到端LLM推理平均提速1.66倍（最高2.49倍）。

Conclusion: 针对Trainium架构的定制化优化技术能够显著提升矩阵乘法性能和LLM推理效率，证明了所提出方法的有效性。

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

TL;DR: AttnCache是一个加速LLM预填充推理阶段的框架，通过检索和重用相似的注意力图来减少自注意力计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现实工作负载仅依赖预填充阶段，其中自注意力计算因序列长度的二次复杂度成为主要性能瓶颈。研究发现语义不同的句子在不同层和头中往往产生相似的注意力图。

Method: 基于注意力图记忆数据库，采用高效缓存和相似性搜索技术来识别和重用预缓存的注意力图，从而减少自注意力计算。

Result: 实验结果显示，在CPU上平均实现1.2倍端到端和2倍注意力加速，在GPU上实现1.6倍端到端和3倍注意力加速，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: AttnCache能有效加速LLM预填充推理，显著减少计算开销，同时保持模型精度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出监督强化学习(SRL)框架，将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑"动作"序列，通过结合监督学习和强化学习的优势，解决小规模开源模型在多步推理任务中的训练难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理任务上表现不佳。对于小规模开源模型，强化学习在正确解很少被采样时失败，而监督微调则容易通过逐词模仿过度拟合长演示。

Method: SRL将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑动作序列，训练模型在提交每个动作前生成内部推理独白。它基于模型动作与专家动作的相似性提供平滑奖励，在逐步方式下从SFT数据集中提取专家动作。

Result: SRL使小模型能够学习以前SFT或RLVR无法学习的具有挑战性的问题。先用SRL初始化训练，再用RLVR精炼，可获得最强的整体性能。SRL在智能软件工程任务上也有效泛化。

Conclusion: SRL是一个稳健且多功能的面向推理的LLM训练框架，通过结合监督学习和强化学习的优势，有效解决了小模型在多步推理任务中的训练挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

*Feijie Wu,Weiwu Zhu,Yuxiang Zhang,Soumya Chatterjee,Jiarong Zhu,Fan Mo,Rodin Luo,Jing Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PORTool是一种强化学习方法，通过鼓励工具使用LLM探索多种正确答案的轨迹来解决当前工具使用LLM在动态环境中性能有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具使用LLM在静态数据集上训练，只能模仿通用工具调用例程，无法在动态工具调用环境中探索可能的解决方案，导致性能受限。

Method: 使用强化学习方法：1)为给定查询生成多个轨迹，形成树状结构；2)基于产生正确答案和成功工具调用的能力为每个步骤分配奖励；3)使用步骤奖励计算分叉相对优势和轨迹相对优势来训练LLM。

Result: 实验使用17个工具处理用户查询，涵盖时间敏感和时间不变主题。与其它训练方法相比，PORTool在最终准确性和工具调用步骤数量方面显示出显著改进。

Conclusion: PORTool通过强化学习鼓励探索多种轨迹，显著提升了工具使用LLM在动态环境中的性能，并通过消融研究验证了步骤奖励设计的必要性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

### [20] [Rethinking Cross-lingual Alignment: Balancing Transfer and Cultural Erasure in Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26024)
*HyoJung Han,Sweta Agrawal,Eleftheria Briakou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估跨语言对齐（CLA）中知识转移与文化擦除权衡的框架，发现现有方法在提升事实转移的同时会损害文化本地化，并基于模型内部表示分析提出了分层激活引导的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言对齐虽然能促进多语言知识转移，但可能导致"文化擦除"问题，即模型无法根据查询语言提供文化相关的差异化回答。

Method: 引入转移-本地化平面评估框架，重新评估现有CLA方法，分析模型内部表示，并提出基于分层激活引导的Surgical Steering方法。

Result: 研究发现现有CLA方法在六种语言中都一致地以牺牲文化本地化为代价来改善事实转移，且事实转移和文化特定知识在不同模型层中具有最优可引导性。

Conclusion: 通过在不同层应用针对性激活引导，Surgical Steering方法能够更好地平衡知识转移和文化本地化这两个竞争目标。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了一个基于自然语言处理的流程来识别放射学报告中的偶发甲状腺发现，评估其患病率、特征和临床结果。研究发现ITFs很常见，且与导致检测小、低风险癌症的级联效应密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着非甲状腺指征影像检查的增加，偶发甲状腺发现日益常见，但其患病率、特征和临床后果仍不明确。

Method: 回顾性队列研究，使用基于transformer的自然语言处理流程从多模态和身体区域的影像报告中识别ITFs并提取结节特征。

Result: 在115,683名患者中，7.8%有ITFs，其中92.9%为结节。ITFs患者甲状腺结节诊断、活检、甲状腺切除术和甲状腺癌诊断的几率更高。大多数癌症为乳头状癌，且ITFs检测的癌症更大。

Conclusion: ITFs很常见，且与导致检测小、低风险癌症的级联效应密切相关。这些发现强调了ITFs在甲状腺癌过度诊断中的作用，以及需要标准化报告和更有选择性的随访。

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

TL;DR: QCoder Benchmark是一个评估LLM在量子编程领域表现的框架，支持量子模拟器环境和真实人类代码对比，实验显示推理模型表现优于GPT-4o和人类平均水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补LLM在需要与硬件设备交互的领域（如量子编程）中的评估空白，传统代码生成任务主要关注软件编程，而量子编程涉及专门的硬件执行环境。

Method: 引入QCoder Benchmark评估框架，包含两个关键特性：1）支持量子模拟器环境评估，提供电路深度、执行时间等域特定指标反馈；2）整合真实编程竞赛中的人类代码提交，支持定量比较和定性分析。

Result: 实验结果显示，GPT-4o等先进模型准确率仅约18.97%，而基于推理的模型如o3达到78%准确率，超过了人类代码的平均成功率（39.98%）。

Conclusion: QCoder Benchmark揭示了量子编程对LLM的挑战性，推理模型在该领域表现突出，发布的基准数据集和公共评估API将支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

TL;DR: 提出1PNS训练范式，通过增加推理路径多样性来提升测试时扩展的效果，引入RPD指标衡量思维链差异，实验显示能显著提高pass@k性能


<details>

Motivation: 解决测试时扩展中模型输出多样性不足的问题，传统1P1S训练导致推理路径单一，限制了模型性能提升

Method: 提出1PNS训练范式，使用RPD指标衡量多步思维链的语义差异，基于RPD选择最大多样性的解决方案集进行微调

Result: RPD选择的训练集产生更多样化的输出，在pass@16上平均提升2.80%，在AIME24上提升4.99%，显著增强了测试时扩展的效果

Conclusion: 1PNS训练范式通过增加推理路径多样性有效提升了测试时扩展的性能，RPD指标是衡量思维链差异的有效工具

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于没有同时标注说服技巧和语篇关系的数据集，本研究旨在探索这两种语言现象之间的关系，以帮助检测在线宣传和错误信息。

Method: 使用SemEval 2023 Task 3数据集作为基础，开发基于LLM的分类器标注PDTB 3.0语篇关系，评估了4个LLM和10种提示，创建了5个银数据集。

Result: 统计分析显示六种语篇关系（原因、目的、对比、原因+信念、让步、条件）在说服性文本中起关键作用，特别是在使用负载语言、夸张/最小化、重复和制造怀疑时。

Conclusion: 语篇关系在说服性文本中扮演重要角色，这一发现有助于检测在线宣传和错误信息，并增进对有效沟通的理解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

Motivation: 现有的SSM/GRM方法通常只模拟单个注意力头，可能限制了表达能力。需要一种能够模拟多头注意力机制的更高效架构。

Method: 提出MossNet架构，在通道混合MLP块和时间混合SSM核中都使用专家混合(MoE)来实现多个"注意力头"，模拟线性多头注意力机制。

Result: 在语言建模和下游评估中，MossNet在相似模型大小和数据预算下优于Transformer和SSM架构。更大规模的变体在万亿token训练中进一步证实了其可扩展性和优越性能。

Conclusion: MossNet是高效、高性能循环LLM架构的一个有前景的新方向，在真实设备上表现出良好的运行速度和资源使用效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在指令遵循任务中存在统计效率低和弃权率高的问题，需要改进模型的校准能力和高概率区域生成能力。

Method: 使用监督微调方法，在最终层添加SDM激活层进行二元分类，通过对比输入编码方案和在线生成硬负例来优化下一个标记的损失函数。

Result: 与强监督基线相比，SDM模型显著减少了弃权率，提高了统计效率。

Conclusion: SDM语言模型能够有效提升预训练模型在指令遵循任务中的性能，通过简单的微调即可实现更好的校准和生成质量。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估通常依赖单一指令模板，忽视了模型对指令风格的敏感性，这对实际部署至关重要。

Method: 通过系统地将基准问题转换为多种指令风格，引入跨响应相似性(CRS)来衡量风格自一致性，并在十个LLM和四个推理基准上进行实验。

Result: 实验显示指令风格可使准确率变化高达16.7个百分点，确定性解码产生更稳定的输出，模型规模与跨风格一致性正相关。

Conclusion: RCScore提供了评估指令鲁棒性的原则性方法，一致性可作为模型可靠性的有价值代理指标。

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)方法，通过为每个token分配不同的时间步调度来解决扩散语言模型中的更新遗忘问题，显著提升了控制性和流畅度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在实际控制性方面存在脆弱性，主要问题是更新遗忘——均匀且上下文无关的更新会导致token级波动，抹去早期语义编辑并破坏累积细化过程，从而降低流畅性和连贯性。

Method: 提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)，通过为每个token分配时间步调度实现软语义排序：关键token早期冻结，不确定token持续细化。可实例化为固定策略或基于任务信号的自适应策略。

Result: 在情感控制任务中，TTA将准确率提高超过20%，困惑度几乎减半，且使用不到五分之一的时间步；在去毒化任务中，最大毒性从14.5降至12.2，困惑度从32.0降至26.0。

Conclusion: 通过时间步分配实现的软化排序是缓解更新遗忘、实现稳定可控扩散文本生成的关键机制。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

TL;DR: WIMHF方法使用稀疏自编码器解释人类反馈数据，识别可解释的特征来理解反馈数据编码的偏好，实现数据筛选和个性化偏好预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈可能以不可预测的方式改变语言模型，但实践者缺乏对反馈数据编码内容的理解。现有方法需要预先指定假设，难以自动提取相关特征。

Method: 引入WIMHF方法，使用稀疏自编码器解释反馈数据，表征数据集能够测量的偏好和标注者实际表达的偏好。

Result: 在7个数据集上，WIMHF识别出少量人类可解释特征，这些特征解释了黑盒模型偏好预测信号的大部分。发现不同平台用户偏好差异显著，并识别出潜在的不安全偏好。

Conclusion: WIMHF为实践者提供了理解和使用偏好数据的人类中心分析方法，支持有效的数据筛选和细粒度个性化。

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估全局RAG能力的基准GlobalQA，并开发了GlobalRAG框架来提升模型在跨文档信息聚合任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG评估基准主要关注局部RAG（在少量文档中检索相关片段），但现实应用需要全局RAG能力——跨整个文档集合聚合分析信息以获得语料库级别的洞察。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架：通过块级检索保持结构连贯性，集成LLM驱动的智能过滤器消除噪声文档，并整合聚合模块进行精确符号计算。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B模型上，GlobalRAG达到6.63 F1分数，而最强基线仅为1.51 F1，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 现有RAG方法在全局任务上表现不佳，GlobalRAG框架显著提升了全局RAG能力，为跨文档信息聚合任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 通过将语用学理论作为提示提供给语言模型，可以显著提升其在理解隐含意义任务上的表现，最高可提升9.6%的分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确理解隐含意义在人类交流和语言使用中至关重要，语言模型也应具备这种能力。

Method: 提出一种方法，将语用学理论（如格莱斯语用学和关联理论）概述作为提示提供给语言模型，引导其通过逐步推理过程得出最终解释。

Result: 相比仅提示中间推理而不呈现语用学理论的基线方法，该方法使语言模型在语用推理任务上的得分最高提升9.6%。在较大模型中，仅提及语用学理论名称也能带来1-3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 将语用学理论作为提示是语言模型理解隐含意义的有效上下文学习方法。

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现预训练语言模型在区分借词和母语词汇方面表现不佳，即使在有明确指令和上下文信息的情况下也是如此。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练语言模型是否具备类似人类识别借词的能力，特别是在双语社区中，主导语言持续对少数民族语言施加词汇影响的情况下。

Method: 评估了多个预训练语言模型在10种语言上的借词识别能力，使用了明确指令和上下文信息。

Result: 模型在区分借词和母语词汇方面表现很差，证实了现代NLP系统对借词存在偏见而非母语等价词。

Conclusion: 这项工作对开发少数民族语言的NLP工具以及在主导语言词汇压力下支持语言保护具有重要影响。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在视觉语言模型压缩过程中，不同知识蒸馏方法对多语言性能的影响，发现某些蒸馏配置能在模型尺寸减半的情况下保持甚至提升多语言检索鲁棒性，而其他方法则无法维持跨任务稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在不同语言间表现不均衡，这一问题在模型尺寸减小时更加严重。知识蒸馏在将知识从大模型迁移到小模型方面显示出潜力，但在多语言环境中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用五种蒸馏方法对CLIP和SigLIP2模型进行控制性实证研究，评估它们对跨语言表示一致性和下游任务性能稳定性的影响，涵盖领域内检索和领域外视觉问答任务。

Result: 研究发现某些蒸馏配置能在模型尺寸减半的情况下保持或改善多语言检索鲁棒性，但其他方法无法维持跨任务稳定性，揭示了仅靠聚合准确率无法发现的设计敏感性权衡。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在多语言视觉语言模型压缩中具有复杂的影响，不同蒸馏方法在保持跨语言表示一致性和任务稳定性方面表现出显著差异，需要仔细选择蒸馏策略。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

TL;DR: 提出Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD)方法，利用神经元激活的稀疏性和跨样本一致性来无监督选择最佳候选答案，显著减少token使用并支持早期停止。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅使用外部信号（如token概率、熵或自评估）来评分候选答案，但这些信号在训练后可能校准不佳。研究发现内部神经元激活包含更丰富的信息。

Method: 基于神经元激活分析，提出NAD方法：通过激活稀疏性和跨样本神经元一致性来选择最佳候选答案，仅使用内部信号且不需要可比较的文本输出。

Result: 在数学和科学基准测试中与多数投票相当；在开放式编码基准测试中优于Avg@64；通过早期停止减少99%的token使用，生成质量损失最小。

Conclusion: 内部信号为无标签集成解码提供了可靠、可扩展且高效的指导，神经元激活模式是评估模型推理质量的强有力指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么LLMs在数字嵌入表示上表现准确，但在处理数字信息时却经常产生错误输出，探索语言模型如何操作数字并量化这些机制的准确性下限。

Method: 通过分析不同语言模型的隐藏状态和输入上下文，创建通用探针来追踪信息（包括输出错误的原因）到特定层。

Result: 发现不同语言模型学习到了可互换的数字表示，这些表示是系统化、高度准确且普遍的，允许创建通用探针并追踪错误到特定层。

Conclusion: 研究为理解预训练LLMs如何操作数字奠定了基础，并指出了更准确探针技术在改进LLMs架构方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

TL;DR: 对ChatGPT Atlas在网页游戏中的交互能力进行评估，发现在逻辑推理类游戏中表现出色，但在需要实时精确控制的游戏中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然ChatGPT Atlas已展示信息检索能力，但其在动态交互环境中的表现尚未充分探索，本研究旨在评估其网页交互能力。

Method: 使用浏览器游戏作为测试场景，包括T-Rex Runner、数独、Flappy Bird和Stein.world，以游戏得分作为量化指标评估性能。

Result: Atlas在数独等逻辑推理任务中表现优异，完成速度显著快于人类基准，但在需要精确时机和运动控制的实时游戏中表现很差，经常无法通过初始障碍。

Conclusion: Atlas具备强大的分析处理能力，但在需要实时交互的动态网页环境中仍存在明显局限性。

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our
project can be found at https://atlas-game-eval.github.io.

Motivation: 解决教育场景中语言模型部署面临的隐私担忧、计算资源限制和教学有效性三大挑战，需要能够本地运行且可靠的小型开源模型。

Method: 结合领域特定工具和自我反思推理管道，支持迭代推理、工具使用和错误恢复，通过两阶段LoRA微调在GPT-4o生成的合成数据上训练3B和8B模型。

Result: 8B-SCRIBE模型在相关性和可操作性等关键维度上达到或超过更大模型的质量，学生评价与GPT-4o和Llama-3.3 70B相当。

Conclusion: SCRIBE证明了在低资源、隐私敏感的教育应用中部署小型语言模型的可行性。

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在经济学、心理学等专业领域表现不佳的问题，这些领域需要深入、原则性的理解。

Method: ACER方法：1) 生成学科目录表；2) 基于布鲁姆分类法创建问答对；3) 使用交错课程安排进行持续预训练，确保内容和认知维度的对齐学习。

Result: 在Llama 3.2模型上，微经济学准确率提升5个百分点，所有目标领域平均提升3个百分点，非目标领域也提升0.7分。在ARC和GPQA基准上提升超过2个绝对点，同时保持通用推理任务稳定。

Conclusion: ACER提供了一个可扩展且有效的解决方案，用于缩小LLMs在关键领域的能力差距，同时防止灾难性遗忘并促进跨领域知识迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)生成合成谬误样本，然后对大型语言模型(LLM)进行轻量级微调。

Result: 微调后的模型相比原始基线实现了显著准确率提升，LLaMA 3.1 8B模型在MISSCI测试集上的F1分数绝对提升了35%以上。

Conclusion: 通过引入合成谬误数据来增强有限的标注资源，可以显著提高LLM在现实世界科学错误信息任务上的零样本分类性能，即使计算资源有限。

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Conclusion: 为协作式多智能体LLM团队的自动化设计提供了新的基础。

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language

Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

Result: 在11个主流LLMs上的实验显示：知识维度仅Gemini-2.5 Pro超过60%准确率；素养维度最佳模型QWQ仍落后人类智能近30%。

Conclusion: LLMs在教育应用中仍有很大改进空间，OmniEduBench为全面评估LLMs教育能力提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

*Zeliang Zong,Kai Zhang,Zheyang Li,Wenming Tan,Ye Ren,Yiyan Zhai,Jilin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSLC方法结合稀疏优化和低秩逼近来压缩大语言模型，无需额外训练即可在LLaMA和Qwen2.5模型上实现50%压缩且性能不下降，获得1.63倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然表现出色，但其广泛部署受到带宽和计算需求的限制。现有方法如剪枝和低秩逼近各有优势，但它们的协同作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于理论分析，将低秩逼近和稀疏优化统一为一个问题，并通过迭代优化算法求解，结合两种技术的优势。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen2.5模型(7B-70B)上的实验表明，SSLC无需额外训练步骤，始终优于单独方法，达到最先进结果。Qwen2.5压缩50%无性能下降，至少1.63倍加速。

Conclusion: SSLC为高效LLM部署提供了实用解决方案，证明了稀疏和低秩方法的协同效应。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了贝叶斯网络LLM融合框架，通过概率机制整合三个LLM的预测结果，在情感分析任务中实现了约6%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前领域特定LLM缺乏透明度、微调成本高、需要大量提示工程、跨领域结果不一致以及高计算需求带来的环境负面影响等问题。

Method: 使用贝叶斯网络进行后期融合，将多个LLM的情感预测建模为概率节点，整合FinBERT、RoBERTa和BERTweet三个模型的预测结果。

Result: 在三个具有不同语言和上下文特征的人工标注金融语料库上评估，相比基线LLM实现了约6%的准确率一致提升。

Conclusion: BNLF框架对数据集变异性具有鲁棒性，证明了概率融合在可解释情感分类中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了使用多个LLM代理的集成方法，相比单一LLM，在评估基于像素的AI分诊工具时能提供更可靠的性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定LLM集成方法是否能比单一LLM更可靠地评估临床AI分诊工具的性能。

Method: 分析了29,766个非对比CT头部检查，使用8个开源LLM模型和GPT-4o组成的集成系统，通过多轮提示评估颅内出血(ICH)的存在。

Result: Llama3.3:70b和GPT-4o表现最佳(AUC=0.78)。LLM集成方法在MCC指标上优于单一GPT-4o，且集成方法之间无显著差异。

Conclusion: 中大型开源LLM的集成比单一LLM提供了更一致和可靠的方法来评估临床AI分诊工具的性能。

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

TL;DR: CORE-KG框架通过消融研究验证了其两个关键组件（指代消解和结构化提示）在构建法律文本知识图谱中的重要性，分别减少了节点重复和噪声节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决法律案例文档中存在的非结构化、词汇密集、指代模糊等问题，改进现有LLM方法在知识图谱构建中产生的噪声和碎片化问题。

Method: 使用CORE-KG框架，集成了类型感知的指代消解模块和领域引导的结构化提示，通过消融研究量化两个组件的贡献。

Result: 移除指代消解导致节点重复增加28.32%，噪声节点增加4.32%；移除结构化提示导致节点重复增加4.34%，噪声节点增加73.33%。

Conclusion: 研究为从复杂法律文本中提取结构化表示的LLM管道设计提供了实证依据，强调了指代消解和结构化提示的重要性。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希伯来语未变音时存在高度歧义性，需要准确恢复变音符号以确保正确发音和消除文本歧义。

Method: 将变音恢复构建为零样本分类问题，使用希伯来视觉语言模型将未变音文本作为图像处理，从动态生成的候选集中基于上下文选择最合适的变音模式。

Result: 在正确变音形式保证在候选集中的"oracle"设置下，系统达到高准确率；通过架构增强和优化训练方法显著提升了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉表征在准确自动化希伯来语变音恢复方面展现出巨大潜力，无需依赖复杂的显式语言分析。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

*Miranda Anna Christ,Adrián Csiszárik,Gergely Becsó,Dániel Varga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码器主要提取重复的粗粒度语义属性，而非特定关系，这解释了其高度可压缩性和有限的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Hernandez等人[2023]的单关系发现，系统研究多个关系解码器的组织结构，解释其高度可压缩性的原因。

Method: 开发交叉评估协议，将每个线性解码器应用于其他关系的主题，分析解码器提取的语义属性；使用简单的三阶张量网络进行压缩实验。

Result: 关系解码器集合可通过三阶张量网络高度压缩而不显著损失精度；解码器提取的是重复的粗粒度语义属性（如国家属性），而非特定关系。

Conclusion: Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码本质上是基于属性的，而非关系特定的，这解释了其压缩性和仅对语义相近关系泛化的原因。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

TL;DR: 提出InfoFlow框架解决强化学习中奖励密度低的问题，通过子问题分解、失败引导提示和双智能体精炼三个方法提升探索效率和奖励密度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度搜索场景中，强化学习面临奖励密度低的挑战，智能体需要付出大量探索成本才能获得稀疏的最终奖励，这阻碍了RLVR方法的应用。

Method: 1) 子问题分解：将长程任务分解为子任务并分配过程奖励；2) 失败引导提示：为停滞轨迹注入纠正指导；3) 双智能体精炼：使用精炼智能体压缩搜索历史，减轻探索认知负担。

Result: 在多个智能搜索基准测试中，InfoFlow显著优于强基线方法，使轻量级LLM能够达到与先进专有LLM相当的性能。

Conclusion: InfoFlow通过系统性方法有效解决了强化学习中的奖励密度优化问题，为轻量级模型在复杂搜索任务中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型由于自回归设计和巨大规模面临显著推理延迟问题，现有推测解码方法如EAGLE-2/3使用动态树结构但忽略了GPU设备和批大小等关键系统变量的影响。

Method: 引入CAST动态树解码方法，综合考虑推理成本（包括GPU配置和批大小）来动态优化树结构。

Result: 在6个不同任务和6个LLM上的实验显示，该方法比传统解码方法快达5.2倍，通常优于现有SOTA技术5-20%。

Conclusion: CAST方法通过考虑系统变量有效优化推测解码性能，显著提升LLM推理速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前系统在处理复杂的多页面视觉文档时存在困难，特别是在对元素和页面进行细粒度推理方面。大型语言模型虽然提供了文档理解的机会，但需要更好的框架来处理这类复杂文档。

Method: SlideAgent采用专门的代理，将推理分解为三个层次：全局、页面和元素，构建结构化、查询无关的表示。在推理过程中，选择性地激活专门代理进行多层次推理，并将输出整合为连贯的上下文感知答案。

Result: 广泛实验表明，SlideAgent在专有模型上整体提升7.9分，在开源模型上整体提升9.8分，取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: SlideAgent框架能够有效处理多页面视觉文档的理解任务，通过分层推理方法在文档理解方面实现了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

TL;DR: 本文重新审视编码器-解码器架构的大语言模型(RedLLM)，与当前主流的仅解码器模型(DecLLM)进行全面的缩放对比分析，发现RedLLM具有令人信服的缩放特性和强大性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM研究快速从编码器-解码器架构转向仅解码器架构，但缺乏从缩放角度的严谨比较分析，可能忽视了编码器-解码器模型的潜力。

Method: 使用前缀语言建模预训练RedLLM，采用仅解码器模型的现代配方增强，在150M到8B参数规模上进行全面比较，使用RedPajama V1进行预训练和FLAN进行指令调优。

Result: RedLLM展现出令人信服的缩放特性，虽然DecLLM在预训练阶段计算效率更高，但RedLLM具有可比的缩放和上下文长度外推能力。指令调优后，RedLLM在各种下游任务上达到相当甚至更好的结果，同时推理效率显著更高。

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器架构的LLM具有被低估的潜力，值得重新审视，为开发强大且高效的LLM提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 在医疗等数据敏感领域，缺乏高质量领域特定训练语料阻碍了LLMs的专门应用，而领域专家已将领域智慧提炼成本体规则。

Method: Evontree从原始模型中提取领域本体，使用两个核心本体规则检测不一致性，并通过自蒸馏微调强化精炼后的知识。

Result: 在Llama3-8B-Instruct和Med42-v2上的医疗QA基准测试中，相比未修改模型和领先监督基线，准确率提升高达3.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法在LLMs的低资源领域适应中展现出有效性、效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear是一种混合线性注意力架构，首次在公平比较中超越全注意力机制，在短上下文、长上下文和强化学习场景中均表现优异。核心是Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)模块，通过精细门控机制提升有限状态RNN内存的有效利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统注意力机制在长序列处理时计算复杂度高、内存消耗大的问题，同时保持或提升模型性能。

Method: 采用KDA线性注意力模块，结合Gated DeltaNet和精细门控机制；使用定制化的分块算法和专门的DPLR变体矩阵减少计算量；构建3B激活参数、48B总参数的混合架构，结合KDA和MLA。

Result: 在相同训练方案下，Kimi Linear在所有评估任务中显著优于全MLA，KV缓存使用减少高达75%，1M上下文解码吞吐量提升6倍。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可作为全注意力架构的直接替代方案，提供更优的性能和效率，特别是在处理长输入输出序列时。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

TL;DR: AutoDeco是一种新型架构，通过在标准Transformer上添加轻量级头部，实现真正"端到端"的生成，能够动态预测上下文特定的温度值和top-p值，从而自动控制解码策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的"端到端"标签存在误导性，实际上它们依赖于需要手动调整超参数的非可微解码过程。

Method: 在标准Transformer上添加轻量级头部，在每个步骤动态预测上下文特定的温度值和top-p值以及下一个token的logits，将解码转变为参数化的token级过程。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，AutoDeco不仅显著优于默认解码策略，而且达到了与通过"黑客测试集"获得的oracle调优基线相当的性能，这是任何静态方法的实际上限。

Conclusion: AutoDeco开启了一种新的可引导和交互式LLM解码范式，模型学会了基于自然语言指令调整其预测的温度值和top-p值。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM在训练过程中如何学习人类价值观对齐，发现监督微调阶段主要确立模型价值观，后续的偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会中扮演越来越重要的角色，需要研究它们如何学习与人类价值观对齐，而现有工作主要关注完全训练好的模型，忽略了训练动态。

Method: 使用Llama-3和Qwen-3不同规模的模型，结合流行的监督微调和偏好优化数据集与算法，分析价值观对齐的出现阶段和训练动态。

Result: 监督微调阶段通常确立模型的价值观，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观；不同的偏好优化算法即使使用相同的偏好数据也会导致不同的对齐结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解价值观在训练过程中的学习机制提供了可操作的见解，有助于指导数据整理以及选择模型和算法来改进与人类价值观的对齐。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

TL;DR: AMO-Bench是一个包含50道国际数学奥林匹克竞赛难度原创题目的高级数学推理基准，旨在解决现有基准因性能饱和而失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学竞赛基准对顶级大语言模型的评估效果下降，存在性能饱和和数据记忆泄露问题，需要更具挑战性的基准。

Method: 创建包含50道专家交叉验证、达到IMO难度标准的原创问题，仅要求最终答案以便自动评分，避免数据记忆影响。

Result: 在26个大语言模型上测试，最佳模型准确率仅52.4%，大多数模型低于40%，但显示出测试时计算增加的扩展趋势。

Conclusion: AMO-Bench突显了当前大语言模型在数学推理方面的巨大改进空间，可作为推动语言模型推理能力发展的研究工具。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

TL;DR: Gistify任务要求编码LLM从完整代码库中提取特定功能，生成一个最小化的自包含文件来复现相同输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着编码代理在大型代码库中的部署增加，需要自动设计具有挑战性的代码库级评估方法。

Method: 给编码LLM提供完整代码库访问权限和特定入口点，要求生成仅包含执行命令所需基本组件的最小自包含文件。

Result: 当前最先进的模型在可靠解决Gistify任务方面表现不佳，特别是对于执行轨迹较长的任务。

Conclusion: Gistify任务需要代码库结构理解、执行流建模和大代码补丁生成能力，现有模型在这方面仍有困难。

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了时空建模和空间注意力机制在深度学习模型中对水下目标检测的有效性。通过比较YOLOv5、T-YOLOv5和带CBAM的T-YOLOv5，发现时空增强模型在动态海洋环境中显著提高了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决水下目标检测在动态海洋环境中的挑战，包括突然移动、部分遮挡和渐变运动等复杂情况，探索时空建模和注意力机制如何提升检测可靠性。

Method: 第一阶段评估T-YOLOv5与标准YOLOv5的性能；第二阶段开发了带卷积块注意力模块(CBAM)的T-YOLOv5增强版本，通过比较三个模型来验证时空建模和注意力机制的效果。

Result: 测试结果显示：YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，T-YOLOv5为0.813，T-YOLOv5+CBAM为0.811。时空增强模型在复杂对象检测中表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T-YOLOv5相比标准模型显著提高了检测可靠性，而带CBAM的T-YOLOv5在挑战性场景中进一步提升了性能，但在简单场景中会损失一些精度。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机视觉中的异常检测局限于工业缺陷或合成异常，无法捕捉真实世界异常的丰富性和不可预测性，需要更贴近人类认知的评估基准。

Method: 构建CAVE基准，包含细粒度标注，基于视觉表现、复杂性、严重性和常见性对异常进行分类，并采用认知科学研究启发的方法来评估VLMs。

Result: 实验显示即使采用先进的提示策略，最先进的视觉语言模型在视觉异常感知和常识推理方面仍存在困难。

Conclusion: CAVE作为一个现实且认知基础扎实的基准，为推进异常检测和VLMs常识推理研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了现代视觉语言模型在判断视频时间方向（前进或后退）方面的能力，发现大多数模型表现接近随机猜测，远低于人类水平，揭示了当前多模态系统在时间连续性和因果理解方面的根本缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其对视频中时间信息的理解和评估仍然薄弱，作者希望通过判断时间方向这一简单但具有挑战性的任务来探究这一差距。

Method: 作者引入了AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准测试，使用与人类行为基准相同的刺激物来测试视觉语言模型推断自然视频时间方向的能力，并对开放权重和专有、推理和非推理模型进行了全面评估。

Result: 大多数模型在物理不可逆过程（如自由落体、扩散/爆炸）和因果手动操作（除法/加法）上的表现接近随机水平，即使最佳模型也远低于人类准确率。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统虽然能够捕捉丰富的视觉-语义关联，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解所需的归纳偏差，存在根本性缺陷。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自改进方法中，模型在简单查询上能生成高质量轨迹，但在复杂查询上表现不佳，导致优化失衡，形成"马太效应"，最终阻碍模型进一步改进并造成性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出四种高效策略：从分布重塑和轨迹重采样两个角度，在探索-学习自改进过程中实现头尾再平衡。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct和InternVL2.5-4B模型上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续提升视觉推理能力，平均比普通自改进方法高出3.86分。

Conclusion: 通过头尾再平衡策略有效解决了自改进过程中的马太效应问题，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Motivation: 研究视频生成模型是否能够作为零样本推理器在具有挑战性的视觉推理场景中使用，特别是评估其世界知识编码和推理能力。

Method: 通过构建MME-CoF基准测试，在12个维度上系统评估Veo-3模型的推理行为，包括空间、几何、物理、时间和具身逻辑等方面。

Result: 当前视频模型在短时空间连贯性、细粒度定位和局部一致动态方面显示出有前景的推理模式，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面仍存在限制。

Conclusion: 视频模型尚不能作为独立的零样本推理器可靠使用，但作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎显示出令人鼓舞的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

Motivation: 现有的Text-to-SQL系统在静态单轮任务中表现良好，但在真实交互场景中，用户意图会随着中间结果而动态演变，现有系统难以应对这种需求。

Method: 采用自动化两阶段流水线：基于数据库表结构树表示的任务合成和验证。通过LLM生成任务，然后进行交互导向的过滤和专家验证。

Result: 构建了包含13个领域、1072个任务的基准测试，人类评估确认合成数据100%正确。GPT-4o仅达到58.34%整体准确率和23.81%的Pass@5指标。

Conclusion: DySQL-Bench揭示了当前Text-to-SQL系统在动态交互场景中的局限性，为开发更适应真实世界需求的系统提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have achieved strong results in static,
single-turn tasks, where models generate SQL queries from natural language
questions. However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive
scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple
turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users
iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate
results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a
benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike
previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated
two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree
representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task
generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation.
Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further
propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions
among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database.
The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change.
DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling
1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the
Pass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. All code and data are

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting
with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services,
or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and
development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail
to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that
lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation
Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified
benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.
ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and
privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation
scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal
the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation

Motivation: 解决非回归测试中测试预言生成的长期挑战，目标是生成能够准确判断被测函数是否按预期执行的预言。

Method: 使用多智能体框架，包含四个体现不同测试理念的专家智能体进行协作审议和优化，然后通过生成候选实现并在安全沙箱中执行验证，对失败的预言进行自动调试和修正的迭代自优化循环。

Result: 在七个不同基准测试上的广泛评估表明，Nexus始终显著优于最先进的基线方法。例如，在LiveCodeBench上将GPT-4.1-Mini的测试级预言准确率从46.30%提升到57.73%，在HumanEval上错误检测率从90.91%提升到95.45%，自动程序修复成功率从35.23%提升到69.32%。

Conclusion: Nexus框架通过多智能体协作和迭代自优化机制，有效解决了测试预言生成的挑战，显著提升了预言准确性和下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review

advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.

### [68] [FakeZero: Real-Time, Privacy-Preserving Misinformation Detection for Facebook and X](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25932)
*Soufiane Essahli,Oussama Sarsar,Imane Fouad,Anas Motii,Ahmed Bentajer*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FakeZero是一个完全客户端运行的浏览器扩展，能够在Facebook和X平台上实时标记不可靠帖子，所有计算都在本地进行，不泄露用户数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体信息传播速度快，加速了错误信息的传播，威胁公共讨论。需要开发能够在用户浏览时实时检测虚假信息的工具。

Method: 采用三阶段训练课程：基础微调、领域自适应训练（使用焦点损失、对抗增强和后训练量化）。开发了DistilBERT-Quant和TinyBERT-Quant两种模型变体。

Result: 在239,000条帖子的数据集上，DistilBERT-Quant模型达到97.1%宏F1分数、97.4%准确率和0.996 AUROC，模型大小67.6MB，延迟约103ms。TinyBERT-Quant模型保持95.7%宏F1和96.1%准确率，模型缩小到14.7MB，延迟降至40ms。

Conclusion: 高质量虚假新闻检测在严格资源预算下是可行的，该扩展可为政策制定者提供有价值的工具，并能为研究人员收集大规模虚假新闻数据集。

Abstract: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn
accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse. We
present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that
flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user
scrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference,
and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal
data leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum:
baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,
adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a
dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%
macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of
approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant
variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to
14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality
fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest
performance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve
as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of
misinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens
the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the
wild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection
techniques.

*Kaiwen Zhou,Ahmed Elgohary,A S M Iftekhar,Amin Saied*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SIRAJ是一个通用的红队测试框架，用于发现黑盒LLM代理的安全漏洞。它采用动态两步流程：首先生成多样化的种子测试用例，然后基于执行轨迹迭代构建对抗攻击。通过模型蒸馏方法优化成本，8B模型攻击成功率提升100%，超越671B模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理使用工具的能力带来了新的安全风险，需要全面的红队测试系统来发现漏洞并确保安全部署。

Method: 采用动态两步流程：1) 基于代理定义生成覆盖各种风险结果、工具使用轨迹和风险源的种子测试用例；2) 基于先前执行轨迹迭代构建和优化模型驱动的对抗攻击。使用模型蒸馏方法利用教师模型的结构化推理训练更小但同样有效的模型。

Result: 种子测试用例生成方法使风险结果和工具调用轨迹的覆盖率提高了2-2.5倍。蒸馏后的8B红队模型攻击成功率提升100%，超越671B的Deepseek-R1模型。消融实验验证了迭代框架、结构化推理和红队模型泛化能力的有效性。

Conclusion: SIRAJ框架能够有效发现LLM代理的安全漏洞，通过模型蒸馏方法在保持攻击效果的同时显著降低了计算成本，为LLM代理的安全部署提供了重要保障。

Abstract: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety
risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering
vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic
red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic
two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse
seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and
risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based
adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To
optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that
leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller
models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings,
our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage
of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer
model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1
model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative
framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer
models.

*Haohua Duan,Liyao Xiang,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PVMark是一个基于零知识证明的插件，使LLM水印检测过程可公开验证，解决了现有水印方案因密钥保密性导致的信任问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM水印方案存在信任问题：非公开的水印检测无法证明其忠实执行检测过程。密钥既不能公开（否则攻击者可能移除水印），也不能完全保密（否则检测过程对公众不透明）。

Method: 基于零知识证明构建水印检测的'正确执行'证明，包括映射、随机数生成、比较和求和等约束条件。实现了多个变体，涵盖三种水印方案、三种哈希函数和四种ZKP协议。

Result: PVMark在多种情况下有效工作，能够高效地为最先进的LLM水印方案提供公开可验证性，且不影响水印性能。

Conclusion: PVMark解决了LLM水印检测的信任困境，有望在实际中部署应用。

Abstract: Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to
identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats
emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly
resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself
faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the
secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or
the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be
private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the
dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),
enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third
parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of
`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints
are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and
summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,
covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and
four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of
circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public
verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without
compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in
practice.

*Xingjian Zhang,Tianhong Gao,Suliang Jin,Tianhao Wang,Teng Ye,Eytan Adar,Qiaozhu Mei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出人-LLM协作框架，从仅标签标注中推断思维轨迹，通过拒绝采样方法重构推理过程，用于微调开源LLM评估器和改进专有LLM的标注指南，显著提升LLM与人类评估的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估器在主观任务中可靠性有限，人类判断涉及超越标注标签的细微推理，而思维轨迹信息丰富但难以收集和整理。

Method: 使用人-LLM协作框架和简单的拒绝采样方法，从仅标签标注中大规模重构思维轨迹，应用于微调开源LLM评估器和合成更清晰的专有LLM标注指南。

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法显著提高了LLM与人类评估的一致性，改进的标注指南还增加了不同LLM模型间的一致性。

Conclusion: LLM可作为未揭示人类思维轨迹的实用代理，使仅标签语料库扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，从而提升LLM评估器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对齐基于LLM的评判者与人类偏好是一个重大挑战，因为它们难以校准且经常存在评分标准敏感性、偏见和不稳定性。克服这一挑战可以推进关键应用，如为RLHF创建可靠的奖励模型和构建有效的路由系统。

Method: 提出了一个基于角色的偏好建模框架，通过聚合多个基于评分标准的评判者输出来学习偏好。实现了两种聚合器：广义加性模型(GAM)和多层感知器(MLP)。

Result: 研究了该方法相对于简单基线的性能，并通过人类和LLM评判者偏见的案例研究评估了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 主要贡献包括基于角色的偏好标签大规模合成方法和两种不同的聚合器实现(GAM和MLP)。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

*Bo Pang,Deqian Kong,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Yingbo Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Reasoning Curriculum，一个两阶段课程学习方法：先在数学领域进行强化学习培养推理能力，然后在多领域联合强化学习中迁移和巩固这些能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要在数学和代码领域培养大语言模型的推理能力，但缺乏向其他领域的有效迁移。

Method: 两阶段课程学习：阶段1在数学领域进行强化学习，使用可验证奖励；阶段2在多领域数据进行联合强化学习，迁移推理技能。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B上的多领域评估显示一致性能提升，消融实验证明两阶段都必要，数学优先方法增强了解决复杂问题所需的关键认知行为。

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一个紧凑、易于采用的方法来提升通用推理能力，无需专门的奖励模型，仅需标准可验证性检查。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工具学习领域，缺乏专门为函数调用任务设计的奖励模型，这限制了智能体AI的发展。

Method: 提出基于规则评分和多维采样的成对偏好数据构建流程，创建了ToolPref-Pairwise-30K数据集，并开发了TRBench基准测试。

Result: 基于Qwen3-4B/8B系列的模型在成对奖励判断中准确率提升高达14.28%，显著优于Claude 4和OpenAI o3等前沿模型，在推理时减少66%以上的输出token使用。

Conclusion: ToolRM不仅提升了工具学习的性能，还能泛化到更广泛的评估任务，为未来研究提供了数据和模型检查点。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

Motivation: 随着人工智能发展，人机交互成为重要场景，机器需要更好地理解人类的情境和目的。情境工程作为解决这一挑战的概念被提出，但需要系统化的理论框架。

Method: 通过历史分析追溯情境工程的发展阶段，从早期人机交互框架到智能代理时代，提供系统性定义并分析关键设计要素。

Conclusion: 情境工程是AI系统发展的重要方向，本文为其提供了概念基础和发展蓝图，是推动AI系统更有效理解人类情境的重要一步。

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在各种推理任务中表现出色，但其处理规范性推理（涉及义务、许可等模态）的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过构建包含广泛形式推理模式的新数据集，从逻辑和模态角度比较LLMs在规范性模态和认知性模态上的推理表现，同时纳入影响人类推理的非形式认知因素。

Result: LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范性推理中存在显著不一致性，并显示出与人类推理研究中观察到的类似认知偏差。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs的规范性推理中实现逻辑一致性所面临的挑战，为提高其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are
released publicly at https://github.com/kmineshima/NeuBAROCO.

Motivation: 实现智能体协作解决复杂问题的愿景，超越个体智能的局限，构建能够并发协作的AI组织。

Method: 提出异步思考协议，包含组织者动态分配子查询、工作者并发执行、中间知识合并的流程，并通过强化学习优化思考结构。

Result: 相比并行思考，推理延迟降低28%，数学推理准确率提升，且无需额外训练即可泛化到未见任务。

Conclusion: 异步思考是实现智能体组织协作的有效范式，能够显著提升推理效率和准确性，并具备良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

TL;DR: 提出SP-MCQA评估方法，通过口语段落多选题问答来评估合成语音中关键信息的准确性，发现低WER并不保证高信息准确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS可懂度评估过度依赖词级准确度指标如WER，无法捕捉真实语音的复杂性或反映人类理解需求。

Method: 提出口语段落多选题问答(SP-MCQA)主观评估方法，并发布8.76小时新闻风格基准数据集SP-MCQA-Eval。

Result: 实验表明低WER不一定保证高关键信息准确度，暴露传统指标与实际可懂度之间的差距；即使SOTA模型在文本归一化和语音准确性方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: 当前许多系统在WER上表现优异但实际可懂度不足，迫切需要更高级、更贴近真实生活的评估标准。

Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as
existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER,
which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human
comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice
Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key
information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour
news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal
that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy,
exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility.
SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text
normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for
high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already
excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑技术通常只关注单一模态的编辑，忽视了LVLMs的多模态特性和知识更新的连续性，导致编辑效果不佳。

Method: 采用混合外部-内部编辑器，包含双外部记忆用于跨模态证据检索和双LoRA适配器实现模态解耦参数更新，通过脑启发知识连接器进行选择性组合推理。

Result: 实验表明MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上显著提升性能，并有效保留先前编辑结果，为LVLMs的持续组合知识编辑设立了新基准。

Conclusion: MemEIC成功解决了LVLMs中多模态知识连续编辑的挑战，为持续知识更新提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

TL;DR: 提出SPECS框架，通过自蒸馏生成偏好数据对，使用偏好训练而非SFT进行冷启动，然后交给强化学习进行深度推理，在多模态基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于SFT的冷启动方法存在指令风格过拟合问题，削弱了分布外泛化能力，影响下游RL性能。研究发现偏好训练方法比SFT方法在冷启动中泛化更好。

Method: SPECS框架：1) 通过自蒸馏生成内省偏好数据对；2) 进行偏好训练，专注于浅层可转移的表面形式标准；3) 将学习结果交给具有可验证奖励的RL进行深度推理。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，SPECS框架相比强基线获得一致性能提升，MEGA-Bench提高4.1%，MathVista提高12.2%，同时减少分布内"卡顿"、改善探索、稳定训练并提高性能上限。

Conclusion: 解耦学习框架SPECS通过偏好训练优于传统SFT冷启动方法，为多模态模型的强化学习提供了更好的初始化策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Result: KD会削弱模型的去偏能力，去偏模型无法从教师知识中获益，不同偏见的鲁棒性变化显著，识别出导致这种行为的内部注意力模式和电路。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模研究KD对去偏影响及其内部机制的工作，为理解KD工作原理和设计更好的去偏方法提供了见解，提出了三种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了序列建模中参数化记忆的传统关联视图，提出了几何视图，证明Transformer模型能够合成自己的原子事实几何结构，将复杂的推理任务简化为易于学习的几何任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，参数化记忆被抽象为实体间共现的暴力查找。作者质疑这种关联视图，探索记忆是否可以通过几何方式存储，特别是当模型能够处理训练期间未共现的实体关系时。

Method: 通过分析Transformer推理的清晰实例，与Node2Vec建立联系，研究神经网络嵌入几何的基本特性，特别是光谱偏差如何自然产生几何结构。

Result: 发现Transformer模型确实能够合成全局的几何结构，即使在没有各种压力的情况下，优雅的几何结构也会自然出现，这简化了复杂的推理任务。

Conclusion: 几何视图为参数化记忆提供了新的理解框架，鼓励研究人员在知识获取、容量、发现和遗忘等领域重新审视默认直觉，并指出了使Transformer记忆更具几何性的改进空间。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Motivation: 衡量AI在真实经济场景中的实际价值，而非仅关注研究型基准测试的表现。

Method: 引入Remote Labor Index(RLI)基准，包含多行业真实经济项目，评估端到端AI代理在实际环境中的表现。

Result: AI代理在RLI基准上表现接近最低水平，性能最高的代理自动化率仅为2.5%。

Abstract: AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge and
reasoning, but it remains unclear how these gains translate into economic value
and automation. To measure this, we introduce the Remote Labor Index (RLI), a
broadly multi-sector benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable
projects designed to evaluate end-to-end agent performance in practical
settings. AI agents perform near the floor on RLI, with the highest-performing
agent achieving an automation rate of 2.5%. These results help ground
discussions of AI automation in empirical evidence, setting a common basis for
tracking AI impacts and enabling stakeholders to proactively navigate AI-driven
labor automation.

TL;DR: 论文发现RL微调LLM时的不稳定性源于BF16浮点精度的舍入误差，改用FP16可有效消除训练与推理间的数值不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL微调LLM时因数值不匹配导致的不稳定性问题，发现根本原因在于BF16浮点精度引入的舍入误差。

Method: 简单地将浮点精度从BF16改回FP16，无需修改模型架构或学习算法，只需几行代码变更。

Result: 使用FP16可获得更稳定的优化、更快的收敛速度，并在多样化任务、算法和框架中表现更强。

Conclusion: 建议在RL微调中重新考虑精度权衡，FP16是更优选择。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.
