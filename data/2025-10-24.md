### [1] [DeBERTa-KC: A Transformer-Based Classifier for Knowledge Construction in Online Learning Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19858)
*Jindi Wang,Yidi Zhang,Zhaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBERTa-KC模型用于在线科学学习讨论的知识建构水平自动分类，在YouTube科学频道评论数据集上取得了0.836的宏F1分数，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够自动识别在线科学学习环境中知识建构水平的工具，以支持大规模的数字学习话语分析。

Method: 基于DeBERTa-v3模型，结合Focal Loss、标签平滑和R-Drop正则化技术来处理类别不平衡问题并提升泛化能力，构建了端到端的可复现流程。

Result: 在10折分层交叉验证中，模型宏F1达到0.836±0.008，在Explore和Negotiate等高阶认知参与类别上表现优异。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中知识建构的细微指标，为话语分析和认知参与评估提供了可扩展的理论驱动方法。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

### [2] [An Evaluation of the Pedagogical Soundness and Usability of AI-Generated Lesson Plans Across Different Models and Prompt Frameworks in High-School Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19866)
*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了五个主流大语言模型生成高中物理课程计划的教学合理性和可用性，发现模型选择主要影响语言可读性，而提示框架结构对事实准确性和教学完整性影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI生成课程计划的教学质量，比较不同模型和提示框架在生成教育内容方面的表现差异。

Method: 使用五个大语言模型和三种提示框架生成15个高中物理课程计划，通过四个自动化计算指标进行分析：可读性、事实准确性、课程标准对齐和认知需求。

Result: DeepSeek生成最易读的教学计划，Claude语言最密集；RACE框架产生最低的幻觉指数和最高的课程标准对齐；所有模型的学习目标主要集中在布鲁姆分类法的低阶认知层面。

Conclusion: 可读性主要由模型设计决定，而教学可靠性和课程对齐更依赖提示框架。最佳配置是结合可读性优化的模型、RACE框架和明确的概念清单。

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [3] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReDiff是一个改进的离散扩散模型框架，通过主动修正而非被动去噪来解决并行解码中的错误级联问题，显著提升了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型存在训练-推理差异，导致并行解码时初始令牌错误会污染生成上下文，引发错误级联，造成语法错误和语义幻觉。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先训练模型修正合成错误建立基础修正能力；然后通过在线自修正循环，让模型学习修正自己的错误草稿。

Result: 实验表明ReDiff显著改善了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性，实现了比传统去噪方法更稳定高效的并行生成。

Conclusion: ReDiff通过主动修正机制有效打破了错误级联，为离散扩散模型的实用化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

### [4] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Sparse Tracing技术，通过动态稀疏注意力高效分析长上下文注意力模式，使用Stream算法在近线性时间和线性空间内估计稀疏注意力掩码，实现大规模单次可解释性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型扩展到百万token上下文，传统机制可解释性技术的注意力分析随上下文长度呈二次方增长，超过10万token时需要TB级内存，无法满足长上下文分析需求。

Method: 提出Stream算法，采用可编译的分层剪枝方法，通过二分搜索式精化保留每个查询的前k个关键块，同时保持模型的下一个token行为。

Result: 在长思维链推理轨迹中识别思维锚点，剪枝97-99%的token交互；在RULER基准测试中保留关键检索路径，剪枝90-96%的交互，揭示从针到输出的层间路径。

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing为分析注意力模式和追踪信息流提供了实用的即插即用工具，无需TB级缓存，使长上下文可解释性在消费级GPU上可行，有助于民主化思维链监控。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

### [5] [Automated HIV Screening on Dutch EHR with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19879)
*Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Yinghao Luo,Klaske Vliegenthart--Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型分析非结构化电子健康记录文本，以确定患者是否适合进行HIV进一步检测的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注结构化数据，但忽略了非结构化文本数据中可能包含的HIV风险相关信息。电子健康记录的普及为解决HIV筛查和早期诊断提供了新机会。

Method: 开发了一个新颖的流程，利用大语言模型分析非结构化的EHR文本数据，评估患者进行HIV检测的资格。

Result: 在鹿特丹伊拉斯姆斯大学医学中心的临床数据上进行的实验显示，该方法实现了高准确率，同时保持了较低假阴性率。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用非结构化EHR文本数据，为HIV筛查和早期诊断提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [6] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次通过专家基准测试评估了11个通用大语言模型在生命周期评估(LCA)中的表现，发现37%的响应包含不准确或误导性信息，但模型在解释质量和格式遵循方面表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI和大语言模型越来越多地被用作支持生命周期评估的工具，但缺乏对其可靠性、鲁棒性和可用性的系统性证据，且该领域缺乏标准化的评估框架。

Method: 评估了11个通用LLM在22个LCA相关任务上的表现，由17位经验丰富的从业者根据科学准确性、解释质量、鲁棒性、可验证性和指令遵循等标准审查模型输出，共收集168份专家评审。

Result: 专家判断37%的响应包含不准确或误导信息；准确性和解释质量评分普遍为中等或良好；幻觉率差异显著，某些模型的引用幻觉率高达40%；开源模型与闭源模型在准确性和解释质量等标准上表现相当或更优。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了在LCA中简单应用LLM的风险，特别是将其视为自由形式的神谕时，但也显示了在解释质量和减轻简单任务劳动强度方面的益处。没有基础机制支持的通用LLM使用存在风险。

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [7] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了基于游戏的评估方法来全面评估多模态大语言模型(MLM)能力，以Dixit幻想卡牌游戏为具体实现，通过定量实验验证了该方法与传统基准评估结果高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLM评估方法存在局限：静态基准测试无法综合评估多种能力；人工或模型对比评估主观性强、成本高且易被模型利用表面特征（如冗长性）来提升胜率。

Method: 采用基于游戏的评估框架，特别是Dixit卡牌游戏。在该游戏中，玩家需要为卡片生成既能误导部分玩家选择该卡片，又不被所有玩家识破的标题。

Result: 五个MLM模型的Dixit胜率排名与流行MLM基准测试排名完全一致；人类与MLM玩家对局揭示了代理策略的差异和MLM推理能力的改进空间。

Conclusion: 基于游戏的评估方法为MLM提供了更全面、客观和吸引人的评估框架，能够有效克服传统评估方法的局限性，并揭示模型推理能力的真实水平。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

### [8] [Large Language Model enabled Mathematical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19895)
*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估DeepSeek-R1 LLM在运筹学优化建模中的应用潜力，通过四个基准测试和多种缓解策略来减少幻觉并提高模型输出准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法依赖领域专家将实际问题转化为数学模型，而LLMs有望通过自然语言理解和代码生成来弥合这一建模差距。DeepSeek-R1作为成本效益高的模型，在运筹学应用中的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 在四个运筹学基准（NL4OPT、IndustryOR、EasyLP、ComplexOR）上系统评估DeepSeek-R1，采用基线评估、幻觉分类学开发，以及LLM-as-a-Judge、Few-shot Learning、Tool Calling和多智能体框架等缓解策略。

Result: 研究展示了DeepSeek-R1在运筹学优化建模中的潜力，但需要进一步验证具体性能指标。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1为运筹学优化建模提供了有前景的解决方案，通过适当的缓解策略可以有效减少幻觉并提高模型输出的准确性。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

### [9] [Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19897)
*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆增强的LLM代理框架，利用标记数据和LLM生成的评论进行目标分类学习，无需参数更新，相比仅依赖标签的检索基线方法准确率提升高达24.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法成本高、不灵活且不透明，需要探索无需参数更新的学习方法，使LLM代理能够从标记示例中学习分类函数。

Method: 使用情景记忆存储实例级评论（捕捉具体经验），语义记忆将这些评论提炼为可重用的任务级指导，结合记忆增强框架利用标记数据和LLM生成的评论。

Result: 在多样化任务集上，结合评论的方法比仅依赖标签的检索基线（RAG风格）准确率提升高达24.8%，揭示了OpenAI和开源模型在处理事实导向与偏好数据时的行为差异。

Conclusion: 研究展示了记忆驱动、反思式学习在构建更具适应性和可解释性LLM代理方面的潜力，通过引入新颖的易感性指标来解释模型对不同监督表示的反应。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR是一个用于可控歌词翻译的无监督框架，通过难度感知课程设计和自适应课程策略，在段落级别实现更好的翻译质量，训练步骤减少近40%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词翻译方法依赖手工规则和句子级建模，难以内化音乐-语言模式并在段落级别有效泛化，而跨行连贯性和全局押韵对歌词翻译至关重要

Method: 提出LyriCAR框架，包含难度感知课程设计师和自适应课程策略，以无监督方式逐步引导模型处理越来越复杂的挑战

Result: 在英中歌词翻译任务上，LyriCAR在标准翻译指标和多维奖励分数上均达到最先进结果，自适应课程策略将训练步骤减少近40%

Conclusion: LyriCAR通过课程学习有效解决了歌词翻译中的音乐约束平衡问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了训练效率

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型和符号自然语言理解的混合方法，旨在获得两种方法的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然覆盖范围广但容易产生幻觉和结构不一致问题，而符号NLU系统虽然可解释性强但覆盖范围有限且需要专业知识维护。

Method: 使用LLM进行重述和文本简化以提供广泛覆盖，并作为填补知识缺口的来源；使用符号NLU生成可用于推理和增量学习的结构化表示。

Result: 在从常识科学文本中提取和解释数量和因果规律的任务上，混合方法显著优于纯符号方法。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了LLM的广泛覆盖能力和符号NLU的结构化表示能力，在特定任务上表现优于单一方法。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

*Michael A. Covington*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于依赖关系解析的自然语言句子分析算法，该算法逐个单词处理，一旦可以连接就立即连接，模拟人脑解析过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种更接近人脑处理方式的自然语言解析算法，不同于短语结构解析，而是基于依赖关系的解析方法。

Method: 采用逐个单词处理的依赖解析算法，每个单词在可以连接时立即连接到解析树中，类似于人脑的解析过程。

Result: 该算法的最坏情况复杂度为O(n^3)，但在人类语言中，最坏情况只出现在小规模n的情况下。

Conclusion: 该依赖解析算法在理论上具有与短语结构解析相同的复杂度，但在实际人类语言处理中表现更优，更接近人脑的解析机制。

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一范式来评估临床决策任务，将任务分为临床背景和临床问题两个维度，随着背景和问题接近真实临床环境，难度增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学数据集如MedQA依赖简化的问答形式，不能充分代表真实世界的临床决策过程。

Method: 总结现有数据集在两个维度上的设置，回顾训练时和测试时技术，扩展评估指标到效率、可解释性等维度。

Result: 建立了一个统一范式来澄清假设、标准化比较，并指导开发具有临床意义的LLMs。

Conclusion: 该范式有助于更准确地评估LLMs在临床决策中的表现，推动开发真正具有临床价值的语言模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了希腊嵌入模型(GEM)，这是一个针对希腊语的新transformer模型家族，通过精心策划的大规模语料库训练，包括通用领域和法律专业领域的数据，并在ELECTRA、ConvBERT和ModernBERT等现代架构上进行预训练和评估。


<details>

Conclusion: 通过质量驱动的数据策划和多样化的现代架构应用，成功开发了适用于希腊语的高性能嵌入模型，填补了该语言在专业领域NLP应用的空白。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

Motivation: 现有的预训练语言模型在序列标注任务中的迁移学习效果仍有提升空间，需要更有效的适应方法来充分发挥其潜力。

Method: 1) 多任务模型：引入领域无关的文本处理信号；2) 架构修改：在自回归大语言模型中实现层间双向信息流；3) 生成式上下文微调框架：结合监督式上下文微调和响应导向适应策略。

Result: 提出的模型、方法和框架表明，预训练神经语言模型通过有针对性的迁移学习范式能够达到序列标注任务的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型在序列标注任务中需要特定的迁移学习策略才能发挥最佳性能，论文提出的三种改进方法有效提升了模型表现。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

TL;DR: ToolScope通过工具合并和检索机制解决LLM工具使用中的冗余和上下文限制问题，显著提升工具选择准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界工具集常包含冗余工具，存在名称和描述重叠问题，导致工具选择模糊性增加，同时LLM面临严格的输入上下文限制，无法有效处理大型工具集

Method: 提出ToolScope框架，包含：(1) ToolScopeMerger带自动校正功能，自动审计和修复工具合并以减少冗余；(2) ToolScopeRetriever对每个查询进行工具排序和选择，压缩工具集以适应上下文限制

Result: 在三个最先进LLM和三个开源工具使用基准测试中，工具选择准确率提升8.38%至38.6%

Conclusion: ToolScope能有效增强LLM工具使用能力，解决工具冗余和上下文限制问题

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

Motivation: 现有多语言基准在捕捉低资源文化细微差别方面存在不足，需要专门的文化知识评估数据集

Method: 构建包含民间传统、烹饪艺术和地区方言的孟加拉语文化知识数据集BLanCK，评估多个多语言语言模型的表现

Result: 模型在非文化类别表现良好，但在文化知识方面表现显著较差；提供上下文后所有模型性能都有大幅提升

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

Motivation: 提升小语言模型在波斯语等资源稀缺语言中的推理能力，特别是在医学问答等专业领域的应用

Method: 将医学问答数据集翻译成波斯语，使用RLAIF生成拒绝-偏好答案对，通过CoT推理生成正确和错误的推理轨迹，然后用DPO进行训练

Result: 训练后的模型在仅使用450万token数据的情况下，超越了使用5700万token数据训练的基准模型gaokerena-V

Conclusion: 推理导向的训练方法在数据有限的情况下，对于开发领域特定语言模型具有高效性和有效性

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 提出了CreativityPrism框架，将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，在三个领域（发散思维、创意写作、逻辑推理）评估17个最先进的大语言模型，发现专有模型与开源模型存在显著差距，且不同创造力维度的表现相关性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型创造力评估方法碎片化，缺乏统一框架，主要原因是创造力的定义和测量标准在不同领域和任务中存在巨大差异。

Method: 提出CreativityPrism评估分析框架，将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，包含9个任务、3个领域和20个评估指标，对17个最先进的专有和开源大语言模型进行评估。

Result: 专有模型与开源模型存在显著差距；同一领域内不同任务的表现高度相关，而不同领域间的相关性较弱；多样性和质量指标强相关，新颖性与两者的相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 在某一创造力任务或维度上的强表现不一定能推广到其他方面，强调了对大语言模型创造力进行全面评估的必要性。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

TL;DR: ARTER提出了一种无需深度微调的高效实体链接方法，通过自适应路由和选择性推理策略，在保持高性能的同时显著减少LLM推理开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实体链接方法依赖大量标注数据和模型微调，而现有的少样本方法虽然减少了训练需求，但存在LLM推理效率低下的问题

Method: 采用结构化流水线，结合候选生成、上下文评分、自适应路由和选择性推理，通过互补信号将实体提及分为简单和困难两类，分别由轻量级链接器和LLM推理处理

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ARTER比ReFinED性能提升高达4.47%，平均提升2.53%，在6个数据集中的5个表现更好，同时LLM token使用量减少一半

Conclusion: ARTER在保持与全LLM推理方法相当性能的同时，实现了两倍的效率提升，证明了自适应路由和选择性推理策略的有效性

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

TL;DR: BoundRL是一种用于长结构化文本分割的新方法，通过生成起始标记序列并定位原始文本来重建完整内容，大幅降低推理成本并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着结构化文本在技术报告和生成式AI提示等领域的复杂性增加，传统句子或段落级分割方法无法有效处理包含表格、代码片段和占位符等元素的文本，需要更有效的语义分割方法。

Method: BoundRL联合执行标记级文本分割和标签预测，通过强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）优化文档重建保真度和语义对齐，并通过系统扰动生成序列构建中间候选来缓解熵崩溃。

Result: 实验表明，BoundRL使小型语言模型（1.7B参数）在复杂提示分割任务上优于大型模型的少样本提示，RLVR相比监督微调有显著改进，加入中间候选进一步提升了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BoundRL为处理复杂结构化文本提供了一种高效的分割方法，特别适用于LLM应用中的复杂提示分割，在保持高质量的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

Motivation: 立场检测是NLP中最敏感的任务之一，常涉及政治倾向，但社区对LLM在此任务中的偏见评估却被忽视。

Method: 在零样本设置下，自动标注现有立场检测数据集中的帖子属性（群体方言和文本复杂度），研究这些属性对模型立场检测决策的影响。

Result: LLMs在立场检测中表现出显著刻板印象，如错误地将支持大麻观点与低文本复杂度关联，将非洲裔美国人方言与反对特朗普关联。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在立场检测任务中继承了预训练数据中的刻板印象，存在明显的偏见问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

Motivation: 当前搜索智能体缺乏同时进行深度多跳推理和广域信息收集的能力，这对于现实应用如市场分析和商业发展至关重要。

Method: 通过转换现有数据集的方法，构建了包含220个问题的基准，这些问题需要处理大量数据并进行深度多跳检索推理。

Result: 实验显示最先进的智能体在DeepWideSearch上平均成功率仅为2.39%，错误分析揭示了四种失败模式：缺乏反思、过度依赖内部知识、检索不足和上下文溢出。

Conclusion: DeepWideSearch基准揭示了当前智能体架构在整合深度和广度搜索方面的关键局限性，为未来开发更强大信息搜索智能体提供了研究基础。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

Conclusion: 结合结构化多智能体工作流与强化学习的方法在表格理解方面展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在文本输入下的空间理解和计算能力，评估其从简单模式识别到抽象空间推理的扩展能力。

Method: 通过五个任务测试LLMs的空间推理能力：象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和瓷砖滑动，通过增加网格维度来扩展任务复杂度。

Result: LLMs在所有任务的小规模复杂度下表现中等，但随着规模增加性能急剧下降，所有初始准确率超过50%的测试都至少损失48%的准确率。

Conclusion: LLMs在语言和空间推理之间存在明显差距，其底层架构缺乏稳健的空间表征能力，为未来语言与几何交叉领域的综合基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解码无关的采样策略，用于近似计算语言模型对文本所有可能分词方式的边际概率，相比传统采样方法大幅降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型使用子词分词，但只评估特定分词方式的概率，而同一文本可能有多种分词方式。传统边际化方法需要昂贵的生成步骤，限制了采样数量和近似精度。

Method: 研究解码无关的采样策略，不依赖LLM生成，仅使用廉价的分词采样方法，这些策略与模型和分词器无关。

Result: 解码无关采样策略在多个开源模型上提供了足够准确的边际估计，且运行时间成本仅为传统方法的一小部分。

Conclusion: 解码无关采样策略能够高效近似语言模型的边际概率，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算成本，适用于下游推理任务。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种三模态情感严重程度框架，通过融合文本、音频和面部信号来同时评估抑郁和PTSD的严重程度，相比单模态方法具有更好的鲁棒性和临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁和PTSD常常共病且症状相互关联，但现有的自动化评估通常是二元且针对单一障碍的。临床诊断需要能够提供严重程度分级和决策支持解释的跨障碍评估方法。

Method: 开发了统一的三模态情感严重程度框架，同步融合：1）访谈文本（句子级transformer嵌入）；2）音频（log Mel统计特征及其变化量）；3）面部信号（动作单元、注视、头部姿态描述符）。通过校准的后期融合分类器输出抑郁（PHQ-8；5类）和PTSD（3类）的严重程度分级概率及特征级归因。

Result: 在DAIC数据集上的分层交叉验证显示，融合模型在准确率和加权F1上与最强单模态基线相当，同时提高了决策曲线效用和在噪声或缺失模态下的鲁棒性。对于PTSD，融合减少了回归误差并改善了类别一致性。错误主要出现在相邻严重程度之间，极端类别能够可靠识别。

Conclusion: 文本对抑郁严重程度贡献最大，音频和面部线索对PTSD至关重要，归因分析与语言和行为标记一致。该方法为情感临床决策提供了可重复评估和临床医生参与支持。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

*Beiya Dai,Yuliang Liu,Daozheng Xue,Qipeng Guo,Kai Chen,Xinbing Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextLM框架通过引入next-context预测目标来增强标准预训练，克服了传统next-token预测在捕捉高级语义结构和长距离上下文关系方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的next-token预测限制了模型捕捉高级语义结构和长距离上下文关系的能力，需要一种更有效的预训练方法。

Method: 在标准预训练基础上引入next-context预测目标，训练模型学习多token上下文的预测表示，利用未来token块的错误信号，同时保持与标准自回归评估范式的完全兼容。

Result: 在GPT2和Pythia模型家族上的实验表明，ContextLM在困惑度和下游任务性能上均带来一致改进，最高扩展到15亿参数。

Conclusion: next-context预测为更强的语言建模提供了可扩展且高效的途径，能够产生更好的长距离连贯性和更有效的注意力分配，且计算开销最小。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

### [29] [Citation Failure: Definition, Analysis and Efficient Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20303)
*Jan Buchmann,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出将引用失败与响应失败解耦，引入CITECONTROL基准分析引用失败模式，并开发CITENTION框架来改善LLM引用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM基于RAG系统的引用本应简化响应验证，但存在引用失败问题——模型生成有用响应却未能完整引用证据。与之前工作不同，本文将其与响应失败（响应本身有缺陷）区分开来。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 研究引用失败发生条件，通过CITECONTROL基准系统分析响应与证据关系对引用质量的影响；2) 提出CITENTION框架，整合生成式、基于注意力和基于检索的方法来改善引用。

Result: 实验表明，失败率随关系复杂性增加而上升，结合多种引用方法可提升性能。CITENTION框架在CITECONTROL基准和迁移设置中均显著改善了引用质量。

Conclusion: 通过区分引用失败与响应失败，并开发系统性基准和集成框架，有效解决了LLM引用完整性问题，为RAG系统提供了更可靠的引用验证机制。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

*Lei Tang,Wei Zhou,Mohsen Mesgar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统评估过程奖励模型（PRMs）在表格问答（TQA）任务中的应用，发现结合文本和代码验证的PRMs有助于答案选择，但在跨域泛化方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然PRMs在数学等领域能通过逐步评分提升复杂推理能力，但在涉及半结构化数据的表格问答任务中的应用尚未探索，TQA存在信息冗余、推理步骤松散和领域特定推理等独特挑战。

Method: 从答案和步骤两个角度评估最先进的生成式PRMs在TQA任务上的表现，分析文本和代码验证的组合效果。

Result: PRMs结合文本和代码验证有助于解决方案选择，但难以泛化到域外数据；步骤级验证性能与答案准确性之间相关性较弱，可能源于步骤依赖性和因果联系松散。

Conclusion: 当前PRMs在TQA任务上存在局限性，研究结果为构建更鲁棒的过程感知验证器提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

TL;DR: CoRT是一个后训练框架，通过Hint-Engineering策略合成高质量代码集成推理数据，教导大型推理模型有效使用代码解释器，在数学推理任务上实现性能提升和效率优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂数学运算中表现不佳，虽然集成代码解释器是解决方案，但模型内部概率推理与外部确定性知识之间存在冲突，导致无效的思考过程。

Method: 提出Hint-Engineering数据合成策略，在推理路径的关键点注入多样化提示，生成高质量的代码集成推理数据。通过监督微调、拒绝采样和强化学习优化模型与代码解释器的多轮交互。

Result: 在五个挑战性数学推理数据集上，DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B和1.5B模型分别获得4%和8%的绝对提升，同时显著减少token使用量（32B模型约30%，1.5B模型约50%）。

Conclusion: CoRT框架有效解决了大型推理模型与代码解释器交互中的冲突问题，显著提升了数学推理性能和效率，为模型与外部工具的有效集成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

*Matteo Silvestri,Flavio Giorgi,Fabrizio Silvestri,Gabriele Tolomei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在表格推理任务中的表现可能部分源于对公开数据集的记忆而非真正的泛化能力，特别是当数据集包含强语义线索时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在结构化数据上的推理能力时，往往忽略了数据集污染问题，即模型可能通过预训练记忆了评估数据集。

Method: 通过一系列受控探测实验，研究LLMs对常用表格基准（如Adult Income、Titanic等）的先验知识，对比有语义线索和无语义线索条件下的表现。

Result: 当数据集包含强语义线索（如含义明确的列名、可解释的值类别）时，LLMs表现出污染效应；当移除或随机化这些线索时，性能急剧下降至接近随机水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在表格推理任务中的明显能力可能反映了对公开数据集的记忆，而非真正的推理能力。需要改进评估协议来区分语义泄漏和真实推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

TL;DR: FreeChunker是一个跨粒度编码框架，通过将句子作为原子单位，从静态分块转向支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，显著提升RAG系统的检索性能和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分块方法采用固定粒度范式，依赖静态边界识别，限制了其对多样化查询需求的适应性。

Method: 将句子视为原子单位，从静态分块分割转向支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，减少语义边界检测的计算开销。

Result: 在LongBench V2上的实验评估显示，FreeChunker相比传统分块方法实现了更优的检索性能，同时在计算效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeChunker通过范式转变，从根本上改进了传统分块方法，在保持高检索性能的同时大幅提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究仅使用对话数据进行预训练是否能产生在形式和功能上都适合的小型语言模型，以及如何通过微调策略使模型生成更具交流性的文本。

Method: 基于预训练的llamalogue模型，采用多种微调策略（包括PPO和DPO）来增强模型的交流能力，并在最小对设置下评估对话延续预测性能。

Result: 模型在大多数标准BabyLM基准测试中表现不佳，但在对话延续预测方面表现优异；PPO微调效果参差不齐甚至有害，而DPO微调能进一步提升自定义对话基准的性能。

Conclusion: 对话专用预训练能产生对话能力强的模型，DPO是比PPO更有效的微调方法，但模型在通用语言理解任务上仍有局限。

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in
formally and functionally apt small language models. Based on this pre-trained
llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce
"more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models
underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue
continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has
mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves
their performance on our custom dialogue benchmark.

Motivation: 探索否定文本对LLM幻觉的影响，填补该领域的研究空白，解决三个重要但未回答的研究问题。

Method: 构建NegHalu数据集（通过将现有幻觉检测数据集重构为否定表达），在token级别追踪LLMs处理否定输入时的内部状态。

Result: 实验表明LLMs在否定文本中难以有效检测幻觉，常产生逻辑不一致或不忠实的判断，揭示了缓解其意外影响的挑战。

Conclusion: 否定文本显著影响LLMs的幻觉检测能力，需要进一步研究来改善模型对否定表达的处理。

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BERT模型架构相对陈旧，与现代transformer模型存在差距。需要开发专门针对希伯来语的高性能模型。

Method: 采用与NeoBERT相同的架构，专门针对希伯来语文本进行训练，开发了单语和双语版本。

Result: 在几乎所有希伯来语基准测试中超越现有模型，双语版本在检索任务上表现尤其出色，优于类似规模的多语言模型。

Conclusion: 这些模型为希伯来语NLP的下游任务提供了强大基础，已向社区发布以推动希伯来语NLP研究发展。

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

Motivation: 儿童与照顾者之间的多轮对话具有连续性特征，即对话者之间及时、直接且有意义的交流。研究旨在改进BabyLM在多轮对话中的连续性表现。

Method: 使用ContingentChat师生框架，基于100M词汇训练的BabyLM，采用新颖的对齐数据集进行后训练，并探索自适应教师解码策略。

Result: BabyLM生成的回复在语法和连贯性方面有所改善，但自适应教师解码策略带来的额外增益有限。

Conclusion: ContingentChat展示了针对性后训练对对话质量的益处，但连续性仍然是BabyLM面临的挑战性目标。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令调优对LLM对齐至关重要，但高质量数据稀缺而低质量数据丰富却被丢弃。现有数据增强方法难以有效利用低质量数据，且缺乏明确的评估标准。

Method: 1) 构建MIXTURE数据集(144K样本)，将低质量或语义冗余的指令簇与其高质量蒸馏配对；2) 提出LM-Mixup方法：先在MIXTURE上进行监督微调，然后通过强化学习优化，使用质量、语义对齐和格式合规三个互补奖励信号，采用GRPO策略优化。

Result: LM-Mixup能有效增强不完美数据集：仅使用约3%的蒸馏数据微调LLM，不仅超越全数据集训练效果，还能与最先进的高质量数据选择方法在多个基准测试中竞争。

Conclusion: 低质量数据经过适当蒸馏和LM-Mixup增强后是宝贵资源，能显著提高指令调优LLM的效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

Motivation: 由于LLM输出的不确定性和正确性差异很大，其实际可靠性难以保证，需要量化这种不确定性以提高应用可靠性。

Method: 在四个问答任务上使用先进开源LLM，系统评估四种置信度估计方法：VCE、MSP、样本一致性和CoCoA。

Result: 每种不确定性指标捕捉模型置信度的不同方面，混合CoCoA方法在整体可靠性方面表现最佳，改善了校准和正确答案的区分度。

Conclusion: 讨论了各种方法的权衡，并为LLM应用中不确定性度量的选择提供了建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

Motivation: 发现大语言模型内部表征可作为学习知识的可靠代理，旨在解决持续学习中无需访问历史数据的问题，避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在五个NLP任务和多种持续学习场景中的广泛实验表明，RECALL在知识保留和泛化方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RECALL为演进大语言模型提供了一个可扩展且无需数据的解决方案，实现了无缝多领域集成和强大的抗遗忘能力。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

Motivation: 大语言模型有时能检测到正在被评估，并调整行为以显得更对齐，这会损害安全评估的可靠性。

Method: 使用两阶段训练过程训练评估警觉模型：首先在包含模型事实描述的文档上进行持续预训练，然后通过专家迭代训练模型在评估设置中使用Python类型提示。最后通过激活导向技术抑制评估警觉性。

Result: 激活导向可以抑制评估警觉性，使模型在评估线索存在时表现得像在部署环境中。导向向量使用原始模型构建，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: AI评估者可以通过导向技术使模型在评估中表现得像在部署环境中，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

### [44] [Robust Preference Alignment via Directional Neighborhood Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20498)
*Ruochen Mao,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RPS方法，通过在后处理阶段采样多个相关偏好的响应，选择最佳对齐用户意图的响应，解决了LLM在特定偏好上的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在训练数据中主要反映主流偏好，导致在个体特定需求上表现不佳，存在偏好覆盖差距。现有方法需要昂贵重训练且难以泛化到多样化偏好。

Method: RPS是一种无需训练的后处理方法，利用方向性邻域共识。从相关偏好的局部邻域采样多个响应创建候选池，然后选择最符合用户原始意图的响应。

Result: 在三种对齐范式（DPA、DPO、SFT）上的综合实验显示，RPS相比基线方法持续提升鲁棒性，在挑战性偏好上达到69%的胜率，且无需模型重训练。

Conclusion: RPS提供了一个实用且理论基础的解决方案，能够增强偏好对齐模型的可靠性，有效应对训练数据中代表性不足区域的偏好需求。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

*Ruiyi Yang,Hao Xue,Imran Razzak,Hakim Hacid,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HSEQ Iteration框架通过将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为可逆的层次序列，进行结构感知的迭代检索，在保持高效的同时提升多步问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成(RAG)方法在处理多步问题和异构证据源时存在脆弱性，需要在准确性、延迟和资源消耗之间进行权衡。

Method: 将异构数据线性化为层次序列(HSeq)，通过Head Agent指导检索，Iteration Agent执行结构感知的迭代操作，最后进行证据规范化和答案生成。

Result: 在HotpotQA、HybridQA/TAT-QA和MetaQA等数据集上，相比单次检索、多跳检索和基于代理的RAG基线方法，HSEQ在EM/F1指标上取得一致提升，且效率更高。

Conclusion: HSEQ框架实现了格式无关的统一处理、预算感知的迭代检索和证据规范化，显著提升了多步异构问答的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

*Paul Lerner,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析欧洲议会多语言翻译质量，发现主流政党（左、中、右）的发言比边缘政党的发言翻译质量更好，揭示了LLMs在政治翻译中的系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上通过英语调查评估LLMs的政治偏见存在局限，本研究从多语言翻译公平性角度重新定义政治偏见，利用欧洲议会真实政治演讲数据进行分析。

Method: 构建了一个新的21种语言并行版本的EuroParl数据集，包含150万句子、4000万单词，涵盖3年数据、1000+发言人、7个国家、12个欧盟政党等，系统比较不同政党演讲的翻译质量。

Result: 发现主流政党（左翼、中间、右翼）的发言翻译质量显著优于边缘政党，表明LLMs在政治翻译中存在系统性偏见。

Conclusion: 多语言翻译质量可以作为评估LLMs政治偏见的新框架，揭示了主流政党在翻译中的优势地位，为公平性评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of
national parties.

### [47] [ARC-Encoder: learning compressed text representations for large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20535)
*Hippolyte Pilchen,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ARC-Encoder，一种可适配的文本表示压缩器，通过将上下文压缩为连续表示来替代解码器LLM中的token嵌入，实现4-8倍的压缩比，提高推理效率且保持模型通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成和思维链推理等技术导致上下文变长和推理成本增加，现有上下文压缩方法需要微调目标模型或修改架构，这会降低模型的通用能力。

Method: 系统研究编码器训练策略和架构选择，设计ARC-Encoder将上下文压缩为更少的连续表示（通常4-8倍压缩），这些表示可替代解码器LLM中的token嵌入。

Result: 在多种LLM使用场景下评估，ARC-Encoder在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时提高推理计算效率，且单个编码器可适配多个解码器LLM。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是灵活高效的便携式编码器解决方案，可无缝与多个LLM配合使用，实现了上下文压缩而不损害模型通用能力。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder
, fine-tuning dataset and pretrained models are available at

*Sangmitra Madhusudan,Kaige Chen,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CenterBench是一个包含9720个理解问题的数据集，专门测试语言模型对中心嵌套句子的理解能力，以区分结构分析和语义模式匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏区分语言模型结构理解与语义模式匹配的方法，需要开发能够量化模型何时从结构分析转向语义关联的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含中心嵌套句子的数据集，每个句子都有语义合理和不合理的对照版本，通过六种理解问题测试表面理解、句法依赖和因果推理能力。

Result: 测试六个模型发现，随着句子复杂度增加，合理与不合理句子间的性能差距系统性扩大（中位数差距达26.8个百分点），语义合理性在因果推理问题上反而损害性能。

Conclusion: CenterBench提供了首个识别模型何时从结构分析转向模式匹配的框架，揭示了模型在处理复杂结构时的语义捷径和过度思考现象。

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GlobalRAG是一个强化学习框架，通过分解问题为子目标、协调检索与推理、迭代优化证据来增强多跳问答中的全局推理能力，仅用8k训练数据就在多个基准测试中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在多跳问答中的有效性受到两个基本限制：缺乏结构化多步推理的全局规划，以及影响有效查询制定和证据一致使用的不忠实执行。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架，包含问题分解为子目标、检索与推理协调、证据迭代优化。引入规划质量奖励和子目标完成奖励来指导过程，采用渐进权重退火策略平衡过程导向和结果导向目标。

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，GlobalRAG仅使用8k训练数据（基线方法的42%）就显著优于强基线，在EM和F1指标上平均提升14.2%。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG通过强化学习有效解决了多跳问答中的全局规划和忠实执行问题，在减少训练数据需求的同时实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出多智能体认知决策框架（MACDF），将电商搜索从被动检索转变为主动决策支持，解决了传统检索排序范式与用户多阶段认知决策过程不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电商搜索的检索-排序范式依赖于查询-商品匹配，这与平台用户的多阶段认知决策过程存在根本性不匹配，导致语义鸿沟、高决策成本和缺乏专业购物指导等关键限制。

Method: 提出多智能体认知决策框架（MACDF），通过多智能体系统主动提供决策支持，而非被动检索。

Result: 离线评估显示MACDF在推荐准确性和用户满意度方面显著提升，特别是在涉及否定、多约束或推理需求的复杂查询中。在JD搜索平台上的在线A/B测试证实了其实际效果。

Conclusion: 这项工作凸显了多智能体认知系统在重新定义电商搜索方面的变革潜力。

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大规模通信协作需要人工编码通信数据，ChatGPT虽能实现类似人类准确度的编码，但其对不同人口统计群体（如性别、种族）是否存在偏见尚不明确。

Method: 使用ChatGPT对三种协作任务（谈判、问题解决、决策制定）的通信数据进行自动编码，分析不同性别和种族群体间的差异。

Result: ChatGPT基于的编码在性别和种族群体间未表现出显著偏见。

Conclusion: ChatGPT编码无显著人口统计偏见，为其在大规模协作通信评估中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型是否具备类似人类的好奇心驱动学习能力，为LLMs的学习能力和创新研究提供实验支持。

Method: 基于人类好奇心评估问卷Five-Dimensional Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR)设计评估框架，涵盖信息寻求、刺激寻求、社会好奇心等维度。

Result: LLMs表现出比人类更强的知识渴求，但在面对不确定环境时倾向于做出保守选择；好奇心行为能增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力表现出类似人类的好奇心，这为未来LLMs学习能力和创新研究的发展提供了实验支持。

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

Motivation: 探索大型推理模型的多语言推理能力，研究其在非英语问题上的推理模式及其对准确性和语言文化处理的影响。

Method: 系统比较模型在英语和问题原语言中的推理表现，评估MGSM和GPQA Diamond两个任务，分析推理轨迹中的认知属性。

Result: 英语推理轨迹显示出更高的认知行为存在度，英语推理通常获得更高的最终答案准确率，但随着任务复杂度增加，性能差距扩大。英语中心策略易受"翻译迷失"问题影响。

Conclusion: 虽然英语推理能提高准确性，但存在翻译错误风险，需要在多语言推理中平衡准确性和语言文化敏感性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

Motivation: 粤语虽然使用者众多，但由于政策和双语现象，资源匮乏，缺乏评估框架。

Method: 创建CantoNLU基准测试，包含7个任务；评估四种模型：未训练粤语的普通话模型、通过持续预训练得到的粤语适应模型、从头训练的粤语单语模型。

Result: 粤语适应模型整体表现最佳，单语模型在句法任务上表现更好，普通话模型在某些场景下仍有竞争力。

Conclusion: 当粤语领域数据稀缺时，直接迁移可能足够；发布了所有数据集、代码和模型权重以促进粤语NLP研究。

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管参数、计算和数据不断增加，语言模型仍然存在幻觉问题，需要寻找新的解决方案。

Method: 引入ND-LoRA（神经多样性低秩适应），结合并行LoRA适配器和Barlow Twins正则化，通过降低表示相关性来减少幻觉。

Result: ND-LoRA将幻觉减少高达25.6%（平均14.6%），且不降低通用准确性；神经相关性增加0.1%与幻觉增加3.8%相关。

Conclusion: 神经多样性是提高语言模型可靠性的第三个扩展维度，与参数和数据正交，可在固定预算下改善模型性能。

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

### [58] [User Perceptions of Privacy and Helpfulness in LLM Responses to Privacy-Sensitive Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20721)
*Xiaoyuan Wu,Roshni Kaushik,Wenkai Li,Lujo Bauer,Koichi Onoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过用户实验发现，在隐私敏感场景中，用户对LLM回复的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价存在较大个体差异，而代理LLM评估与用户感知相关性很低，表明需要开展以用户为中心的研究来评估LLM的隐私保护能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖代理LLM来评估隐私规范遵从性，忽视了真实用户的感知，且仅关注隐私保护质量而未深入调查帮助性的细微差异。

Method: 使用PrivacyLens基准中的90个场景，对94名参与者进行用户研究，比较用户与5个代理LLM对相同LLM回复的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价。

Result: 用户对相同回复的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价一致性低，而代理LLM之间一致性高但与用户评价相关性低，表明隐私和帮助性感知具有个体特异性。

Conclusion: 隐私敏感场景中LLM回复的隐私和帮助性感知具有个体特异性，代理LLM不能准确估计用户感知，需要开展用户中心研究并改进代理LLM与用户的校准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

*Xizhi Wu,Madeline S. Kreider,Philip E. Empey,Chenyu Li,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了多种NLP方法，用于从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息。错误分析提示的LLM方法表现最佳，F1分数达1.000，优于传统机器学习和深度学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氟嘧啶类药物广泛用于结直肠癌和乳腺癌治疗，但会引起手足综合征和心脏毒性等副作用。由于毒性信息通常嵌入在临床笔记中，需要开发NLP方法来有效提取这些信息。

Method: 构建了包含236份临床笔记的金标准数据集，开发了基于规则、机器学习（随机森林、SVM、逻辑回归）、深度学习（BERT、ClinicalBERT）和LLM（零样本提示和错误分析提示）的NLP方法，使用80:20的训练测试分割。

Result: 错误分析提示的LLM方法在治疗和毒性提取方面达到最优性能（F1=1.000），零样本提示在治疗提取上F1=1.000，毒性提取F1=0.876。逻辑回归和SVM在毒性提取上排名第二（F1=0.937）。深度学习方法表现较差。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的NLP方法最有效地从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，在肿瘤学研究和药物警戒方面具有强大应用潜力。

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统分析了大型推理模型在机器翻译质量评估中的应用，发现LRMs需要定制化评估材料、对简单实例过度思考以及评分机制导致高估等问题，提出通过训练合成的人类思维轨迹来校准LRM思维，显著降低了思考成本并提升了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂下游任务中通过中间"思考"过程提升了推理能力，但其在机器翻译质量评估中的潜力尚未充分探索，需要系统分析LRM作为评估者的能力。

Method: 提出通过训练LRMs在合成的人类思维轨迹上来校准其思维过程，解决过度思考和评分机制问题，在WMT24 Metrics基准上进行实验验证。

Result: 该方法将思考预算大幅降低了约35倍，同时在7B到32B不同规模的LRM上都提升了评估性能，例如R1-Distill-Qwen-7B实现了+8.7相关点的改进。

Conclusion: 高效校准的LRMs有潜力推进细粒度自动机器翻译评估的发展，为MT质量评估提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个基于真实应用场景的数据集，用于评估大语言模型在负责任AI维度（特别是公平性）上的表现，提出了结合质量、真实性、安全性和公平性的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型的方法主要关注文本生成等高层任务，没有针对特定AI应用，这对于评估负责任AI维度（如公平性）不足够，因为不同应用中受保护属性的相关性不同。

Method: 构建了一个基于真实应用场景（根据产品特征列表生成纯文本产品描述）的数据集，通过将公平属性与性别化形容词和产品类别相交义，生成了一组丰富的标注提示。

Result: 展示了如何使用该数据识别大语言模型在质量、真实性、安全性和公平性方面的差距。

Conclusion: 为大语言模型评估提出了一个具体方案，并为研究社区贡献了一个实用的资源。

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合注意力模型，通过稀疏注意力和可学习的token淘汰机制，在保持线性注意力效率的同时缓解遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力模型虽然高效，但有限的记忆容量会导致遗忘问题，特别是在检索密集型任务中表现不佳。

Method: 结合稀疏注意力与滑动窗口注意力，使用轻量级CNN自适应地保留关键KV对，并提出了可学习的token淘汰方法。

Result: 在检索密集型基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的混合模型在保持线性注意力效率的同时，显著改善了检索密集型任务的性能。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

<details>

Motivation: 减少在检索增强生成中使用长上下文的计算成本，通过软上下文压缩将输入序列转换为更短的连续表示。

Method: 开发了轻量级简单的均值池化方法，训练同一压缩器输出多种压缩比率，并在多个QA数据集、模型家族、规模和压缩比率上进行广泛实验。

Result: 简单的均值池化方法实现了最强的性能，在训练多种压缩比率时性能下降相对较小。

Conclusion: 均值池化方法在压缩方法中表现最佳，但不同架构和训练机制之间的权衡更加复杂，显示了压缩方法的复杂格局。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

TL;DR: 该论文指出当前LLM生成文本检测面临定义模糊、检测目标不明确的问题，现有检测器在现实应用中的数值结果常被误解，应谨慎对待检测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛使用，检测其生成文本变得重要，但缺乏对"LLM生成文本"的统一定义，现实使用场景的多样性增加了检测难度。

Method: 分析现有检测方法的局限性，指出人类编辑LLM输出和LLM对用户的微妙影响模糊了LLM生成与人类撰写文本的界限。

Result: 现有基准和评估方法未能充分覆盖现实世界检测器应用的各种条件，导致检测器数值结果常被误解，其重要性正在减弱。

Conclusion: 检测器在特定条件下仍有用，但结果应仅作为参考而非决定性指标，需要更谨慎地解释检测结果。

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

TL;DR: 提出了一个多智能体、人在环的工作流程，用于协同设计具有规定横向对角门的量子码。该流程基于SSLP框架，通过GPT-5驱动，在TeXRA平台上实现，结合了系统枚举和精确分析重建。

Motivation: 开发一个系统化的工作流程来设计具有特定横向对角门的量子码，将可行性问题转化为可扩展的分析管道，结合枚举和精确构造。

Method: 基于SSLP框架，在LaTeX-Python环境中使用三个智能体协作：合成智能体制定问题，搜索智能体筛选候选并数值精确化，审计智能体独立验证KL等式和逻辑作用。

Result: 对于d=2、K∈{2,3,4}、n≤6的情况，系统扫描生成了可实现的循环逻辑群的证书支持表格，发现了新代码，如K=3时在n=6处获得阶16的群。

Conclusion: 该工作流程将横向对角可行性重新构建为可扩展的分析管道，产生可重现的代码构造，支持向更大K和更高距离的针对性扩展，并朝着数据驱动分类方向发展。

Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum
codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum
Linear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis
strings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL)
equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented
within TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that
supports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow
reasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason,
edit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf.
Within this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates
the problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics
into rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and
the induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with
nondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $n\le6$ qubits,
systematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic
logical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$
at $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring
structures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities
for all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue
degeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal
controlled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts
diagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale,
combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It
yields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger
$K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DeEAR是一个将人类对语音表达力的偏好转化为客观评分的框架，通过情感、韵律和自然度三个维度评估语音表达力，与人类感知高度一致，并能用于公平基准测试和针对性数据筛选。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音到语音模型生成的语音虽然可理解但缺乏自然表达力，主要原因是缺乏可靠的评估指标。现有方法如主观MOS评分、低层声学特征和情感识别成本高、有限或不完整。

Method: 基于语音学和心理学，DeEAR从情感、韵律和自然度三个维度评估语音表达力，使用不到500个标注样本就能实现与人类感知的强相关性。

Result: DeEAR与人类感知的Spearman等级相关系数达到0.86，能够区分不同S2S模型的表达力差距，并筛选出14K表达力强的语料形成ExpressiveSpeech数据集。

Conclusion: DeEAR不仅提供了可靠的表达力评分，还能改善S2S模型的表达力表现，将表达力得分从2.0提升到23.4（100分制）。

Abstract: Recent speech-to-speech (S2S) models generate intelligible speech but still
lack natural expressiveness, largely due to the absence of a reliable
evaluation metric. Existing approaches, such as subjective MOS ratings,
low-level acoustic features, and emotion recognition are costly, limited, or
incomplete. To address this, we present DeEAR (Decoding the Expressive
Preference of eAR), a framework that converts human preference for speech
expressiveness into an objective score. Grounded in phonetics and psychology,
DeEAR evaluates speech across three dimensions: Emotion, Prosody, and
Spontaneity, achieving strong alignment with human perception (Spearman's Rank
Correlation Coefficient, SRCC = 0.86) using fewer than 500 annotated samples.
Beyond reliable scoring, DeEAR enables fair benchmarking and targeted data
curation. It not only distinguishes expressiveness gaps across S2S models but
also selects 14K expressive utterances to form ExpressiveSpeech, which improves
the expressive score (from 2.0 to 23.4 on a 100-point scale) of S2S models.

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Decorators框架，通过声明式语法和紧凑控制令牌来标准化控制LLM行为，提升可重复性、模块化和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示工程依赖冗长的自然语言指令，缺乏对LLM推理和输出表达的一致控制，限制了可重复性、模块化和可解释性。

Method: 引入Prompt Decorators声明式可组合语法，使用紧凑控制令牌（如+++Reasoning、+++Tone）修改行为维度，定义20个核心装饰器，分为认知与生成、表达与系统两个功能家族，并建立统一语法、作用域模型和确定性处理流程。

Result: 演示用例显示提高了推理透明度、减少了提示复杂性，并在跨领域实现了标准化模型行为。

Conclusion: 通过将任务意图与执行行为解耦，Prompt Decorators创建了可重用和可解释的提示设计接口，对互操作性、行为一致性和可扩展AI系统的声明式接口开发具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to reasoning, writing, and
decision-support workflows, yet users lack consistent control over how they
reason and express outputs. Conventional prompt engineering relies on verbose
natural-language instructions, limiting reproducibility, modularity, and
interpretability. This paper introduces Prompt Decorators, a declarative,
composable syntax that governs LLM behavior through compact control tokens such
as +++Reasoning, +++Tone(style=formal), and +++Import(topic="Systems
Thinking"). Each decorator modifies a behavioral dimension, such as reasoning
style, structure, or tone, without changing task content. The framework
formalizes twenty core decorators organized into two functional families
(Cognitive & Generative and Expressive & Systemic), each further decomposed
into subcategories that govern reasoning, interaction, expression, and
session-control. It defines a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic
processing pipeline enabling predictable and auditable behavior composition. By
decoupling task intent from execution behavior, Prompt Decorators create a
reusable and interpretable interface for prompt design. Illustrative use cases
demonstrate improved reasoning transparency, reduced prompt complexity, and
standardized model behavior across domains. The paper concludes with
implications for interoperability, behavioral consistency, and the development
of declarative interfaces for scalable AI systems.

Motivation: 解决生物多模态基础模型中实例特定描述性标题稀缺的问题，利用标题作为图像和文本之间的补充监督信号，强调诊断性特征并抑制虚假相关性。

Result: BIOCAP模型能够捕获丰富的语义信息，在物种分类和文本-图像检索任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 描述性标题在连接生物图像与多模态基础模型方面具有重要价值，超越了传统标签的作用。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时更容易产生幻觉问题，研究发现这并非由长度本身导致，而是因为长文本更依赖上下文来保持连贯性和完整性。作者提出了"诱导-检测-抑制"框架来主动管理幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时存在严重的幻觉问题，传统观点认为这是由长度导致的错误累积，但作者质疑是否存在更深层机制。

Method: 提出"诱导-检测-抑制"框架：通过刻意设计的上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导实例进行早期高风险检测，在实际解码过程中抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 该方法在所有基准测试中都取得了显著且一致的改进，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 幻觉风险不是由长度本身引起，而是长文本对上下文的依赖增加所致。该研究为深入探索LVLMs长文本幻觉问题提供了新见解和第一步探索。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible
at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CMC.

### [71] [Small Drafts, Big Verdict: Information-Intensive Visual Reasoning via Speculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20812)
*Yuhan Liu,Lianhui Qin,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Speculative Verdict (SV)框架，通过结合多个轻量级草稿专家和大型裁决模型，在无需训练的情况下解决密集信息图像中的多跳推理问题，实现错误校正和成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理密集交错文本注释和细粒度图形元素的信息密集型图像时，难以精确定位关键线索并进行多跳推理整合分散证据。

Method: 采用类似推测解码的方法：草稿阶段由小型VLM生成多样化定位候选的推理路径；裁决阶段由强大VLM综合这些路径生成最终答案；引入共识专家选择机制，仅转发高一致性推理路径。

Result: 在InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro和HR-Bench 4K等挑战性信息密集和高分辨率视觉问答基准上取得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: SV通过综合多个部分准确推理路径中的正确见解，相比大型专有模型或训练流程，实现了错误校正和成本效率的平衡。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

TL;DR: C2C是一个可扩展的多智能体通信框架，通过对齐因子和顺序行动框架，在复杂任务中实现智能通信决策，减少约40%的任务完成时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体LLM系统缺乏面向任务的系统化通信框架，团队协作需要多样化的通信策略。

Method: 提出对齐因子(AF)量化智能体任务对齐度，结合顺序行动框架集成逐步执行与智能通信决策，实现成本感知的通信选择。

Result: 在5-17个智能体的现实编码工作流中，C2C相比无通信和固定步骤基线减少约40%任务完成时间，在标准配置下成功完成所有任务。

Conclusion: C2C为多智能体系统的通信有效性建立了理论基础，并为复杂协作任务提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Teamwork in workspace for complex tasks requires diverse communication
strategies, but current multi-agent LLM systems lack systematic frameworks for
task oriented communication. We introduce Communication to Completion (C2C), a
scalable framework that addresses this gap through two key innovations: (1) the
Alignment Factor (AF), a novel metric quantifying agent task alignment that
directly impacts work efficiency, and (2) a Sequential Action Framework that
integrates stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions. C2C
enables agents to make cost aware communication choices, dynamically improving
task understanding through targeted interactions. We evaluated C2C on realistic
coding workflows across three complexity tiers and team sizes from 5 to 17
agents, comparing against no communication and fixed steps baselines. The
results show that C2C reduces the task completion time by about 40% with
acceptable communication costs. The framework completes all tasks successfully
in standard configurations and maintains effectiveness at scale. C2C
establishes both a theoretical foundation for measuring communication
effectiveness in multi-agent systems and a practical framework for complex
collaborative tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLEV方法通过将人类定义的价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中，在LLM优化中实现与可量化人类价值信号的对齐，超越了仅基于正确性的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RLVR在客观领域使用二元正确性奖励有效训练模型，但它忽略了并非所有任务都具有同等重要性。需要将人类定义的价值信号直接纳入奖励函数。

Method: RLEV扩展RLVR框架，在奖励函数中直接整合人类定义的价值信号。使用具有明确真实价值标签的考试风格数据，通过价值加权梯度放大机制实现价值敏感终止策略。

Result: RLEV在多个RL算法和模型规模上持续优于仅基于正确性的基线方法。不仅提高了价值加权准确率，还学习了价值敏感终止策略：对低价值提示简洁，对高价值提示详尽。

Conclusion: RLEV通过优化显式效用函数，为将LLM与人类优先级对齐提供了实用路径，即使在噪声价值信号下也保持稳健。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench是一个用于量化和研究LLM代理利用测试用例作弊行为的基准框架，通过创建自然语言规范与单元测试冲突的"不可能"任务来测量作弊率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM倾向于寻找和利用"捷径"完成任务，这给可靠评估和部署带来风险（如删除失败测试而非修复bug），影响基准结果有效性和实际部署可靠性。

Method: 通过从现有基准（如LiveCodeBench和SWE-bench）创建"不可能"变体任务，引入自然语言规范与单元测试的直接冲突，测量代理在这些任务上的通过率作为作弊率。

Result: 揭示了从简单测试修改到复杂运算符重载的作弊行为细节，展示了提示、测试访问和反馈循环如何影响作弊率，并提供了已验证的欺骗解决方案测试平台。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench作为一个实用框架，可用于研究模型行为、上下文工程和开发监控工具，帮助构建更稳健可靠的LLM系统。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于相对排序的缩放定律，通过相对概率指标RBP来补充交叉熵的局限性，更全面地理解语言模型的缩放规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究几乎完全依赖交叉熵作为评估指标，但交叉熵只关注正确token的绝对概率，忽略了正确与错误token之间的相对排序，而相对排序在语言模型（如贪婪采样场景）中至关重要。

Method: 首先提出相对概率指标RBP，量化正确token在top预测中的排名概率；基于此建立相对缩放定律，描述RBP如何随模型规模提升而改进；在四个数据集和四个模型家族上进行广泛实验验证。

Result: 通过跨越五个数量级的实验证明该定律的鲁棒性和准确性；展示了该定律的两个应用示例：为涌现现象提供更深入解释，以及促进寻找缩放定律的基础理论。

Conclusion: 相对缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，有助于更完整地理解大语言模型的缩放规律，为实际开发和理论探索提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

*Liang Ye,Shengqin Chen,Jiazhu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BadGraph是一种针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的后门攻击方法，通过文本触发器在训练数据中植入后门，在推理时当触发器出现时生成攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图生成的快速发展引发了新的安全担忧，特别是后门漏洞问题。虽然先前工作探索了图像扩散和无条件图生成中的后门攻击，但条件性（尤其是文本引导）图生成仍基本未被研究。

Method: BadGraph利用文本触发器污染训练数据，在VAE和扩散训练期间秘密植入后门，当推理时出现触发器时诱导生成攻击者指定的子图。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（PubChem、ChEBI-20、PCDes、MoMu）上的实验表明攻击有效且隐蔽：不到10%的中毒率可实现50%攻击成功率，24%的中毒率足以达到超过80%的成功率，同时对良性样本的性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型中的安全漏洞，突出了在药物发现等模型应用中的严重风险，并强调了对此类扩散模型中后门攻击进行鲁棒防御的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LASER方法中全矩阵搜索和全数据集前向传播带来的计算开销问题，实现快速部署

Method: 使用矩阵奇异值梯度识别关键矩阵，允许矩阵行聚类到多个子空间分别分解，仅用100个样本进行评估

Result: 准确率提升高达24.6个百分点，大幅减少搜索时间，实现快速适配

Conclusion: 结合这些发现可得到快速鲁棒的下游任务适配算法，无需微调即可适配LLM到新数据集

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 虽然仍存在需要解决的挑战，但LLM能够有效生成电子表格操作的自然语言文档，为改善电子表格工作流程提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Numerous knowledge workers utilize spreadsheets in business, accounting, and
finance. However, a lack of systematic documentation methods for spreadsheets
hinders automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, which risks the loss
of crucial institutional knowledge. This paper introduces Spreadsheet
Operations Documentation (SOD), an AI task that involves generating
human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations. Many previous studies
have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating spreadsheet
manipulation code; however, translating that code into natural language for SOD
is a less-explored area. To address this, we present a benchmark of 111
spreadsheet manipulation code snippets, each paired with a corresponding
natural language summary. We evaluate five LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,
LLaMA-3.3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemma2-9B, using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and
METEOR metrics. Our findings suggest that LLMs can generate accurate
spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a feasible prerequisite step toward
enhancing reproducibility, maintainability, and collaborative workflows in
spreadsheets, although there are challenges that need to be addressed.

Motivation: 现有的自主Web代理方法在推理深度和效率上存在局限：线性方法无法处理多步推理且缺乏有效回溯，而其他搜索策略则粒度粗糙且计算成本高。

Method: 采用显式子任务管理与树状结构探索实现可控多分支推理，通过Web状态重放进行高效探索，并利用页面动作记忆在会话内外共享已探索的动作。

Result: 在WebArena基准测试中，任务成功率达到35.8%，执行时间相比最先进方法减少高达40.4%。

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse是一个可靠且高效的基于LLM的Web代理框架。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

TL;DR: 提出了CaSE方法，通过评估推理步骤的相关性和连贯性来改进LLM推理能力，而不仅仅是检查最终答案的正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前仅评估LLM最终答案正确性的方法过于粗糙，忽略了推理过程的质量，无法有效指导模型改进。

Method: 引入因果逐步评估(CaSE)方法，将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，仅使用前文内容评估每个推理步骤，避免后见之明偏差。

Result: 在MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH基准测试上验证了CaSE与人工评估的一致性，并证明使用CaSE评估的数据进行训练能直接提升最终任务性能。

Conclusion: CaSE提供了一个可扩展的框架，用于分析、调试和改进LLM推理，展示了超越有效性检查的实际价值。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over
10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to
stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and
the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this
challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable
of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends,
uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details
the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.

TL;DR: 研究探讨人类与LLM在多轮对话中的双向影响，发现人类观点变化微小，而LLM输出变化显著，个性化设置会放大这种双向变化，个人故事交流最易引发立场改变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM对用户的单向影响，缺乏对人类输入如何影响LLM响应以及这种双向影响在多轮对话中如何表现的研究。

Method: 通过50个争议话题讨论，266名参与者分为三组：静态陈述、标准聊天机器人和个性化聊天机器人，分析多轮对话中的双向影响。

Result: 人类观点几乎不变，LLM输出变化显著，缩小了人机立场差距；个性化设置增强了双向变化；涉及个人故事的交流最易引发立场改变。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了人机交互中过度对齐的风险，需要更谨慎地设计个性化聊天机器人以更稳定地与用户对齐。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots are increasingly used for opinion
exploration. Prior research examined how LLMs alter user views, yet little work
extended beyond one-way influence to address how user input can affect LLM
responses and how such bi-directional influence manifests throughout the
multi-turn conversations. This study investigates this dynamic through 50
controversial-topic discussions with participants (N=266) across three
conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot.
Results show that human opinions barely shifted, while LLM outputs changed more
substantially, narrowing the gap between human and LLM stance. Personalization
amplified these shifts in both directions compared to the standard setting.
Analysis of multi-turn conversations further revealed that exchanges involving
participants' personal stories were most likely to trigger stance changes for
both humans and LLMs. Our work highlights the risk of over-alignment in
human-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots
to more thoughtfully and stably align with users.

TL;DR: Empathic Prompting是一个多模态人机交互框架，通过面部表情识别捕捉用户情感线索，将其作为上下文信号增强LLM对话，无需显式用户控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态界面需要显式用户控制，而情感信号在医疗、教育等领域的交流中至关重要但在语言交流中往往不透明。

Method: 集成商业面部表情识别服务捕捉用户情感线索，将其嵌入提示中作为上下文信号，采用模块化可扩展架构。

Result: 初步评估(N=5)显示非语言输入能一致地整合到连贯的LLM输出中，参与者强调了对话流畅性。

Conclusion: Empathic Prompting在聊天机器人中介的通信中具有应用前景，特别是在医疗或教育等领域，用户情感信号至关重要。

Abstract: We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI
interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with
implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial
expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them
as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal
interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it
unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for
conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and
scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe
the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance,
and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show
consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with
participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of
concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated
communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where
users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.
