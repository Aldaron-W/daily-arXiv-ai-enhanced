TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了使用大语言模型进行疾病检测的多种适配策略，在DementiaBank语音语料库上评估了9个文本模型和3个多模态模型，发现适当的适配策略可以让开源模型达到或超过商业系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国过半数阴性阴性阴性老年痰病患者未被诊断，语音基础的筛查方法提供了可扩展的检测方案。研究者希望通过比较不同的大语言模型适配策略，找到最有效的疾病检测方法。

Method: 使用DementiaBank语音语料库，评估了9个文本模型和3个多模态音频-文本模型。测试的适配策略包括：上下文学习与不同示范选择策略、推理增强提示、参数效率微调以及多模态整合。

Result: 类质心示范在上下文学习中表现最佳，推理提示对小型模型有显著改善，分词级微调通常获得最高分数。添加分类头显著提升了表现较差的模型。多模态模型表现良好但未超过最佳文本模型。

Conclusion: 模型适配策略（包括示范选择、推理设计和调整方法）对语音基础的疾病检测至关重要，适当适配的开源模型可以达到或超过商业系统的性能。

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [2] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA)框架，通过自合成方法和强化学习来提升语音大语言模型在指令跟随任务中的性能，无需人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型(SpeechLMs)由于模态差异，在指令跟随任务中相比文本大语言模型存在显著性能差距，特别是在处理动态多变的用户语音时表现不佳。

Method: 使用强大的教师LLM通过自合成方法生成大量高质量对齐数据，然后采用基于强化学习的方法将SpeechLMs的行为与教师模型对齐，而不依赖人工标注的监督微调。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效提升了SpeechLMs的指令跟随能力，超越了传统的蒸馏基线方法，并在口语问答和语音转文本翻译等任务上取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RBA框架能够仅使用自生成数据就显著提升SpeechLMs的性能，证明了该方法在多模态语言模型对齐中的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

### [3] [Multilevel Analysis of Cryptocurrency News using RAG Approach with Fine-Tuned Mistral Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03527)
*Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用微调Mistral 7B LLM模型进行多层次加密货币新闻分析，结合图结构和文本摘要，通过RAG技术减少幻觉问题，实现定性和定量分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在加密货币新闻分析中的幻觉问题，提供多层次、多角度的综合分析能力。

Method: 采用4位量化PEFT/LoRA方法微调Mistral 7B模型，结合检索增强生成(RAG)技术，生成图结构和文本摘要，并进行层次化汇总分析。

Result: 模型能够生成包含情感分数的图结构和文本摘要，以及JSON格式的表示，有效减少幻觉问题，提供全面的加密货币新闻分析。

Conclusion: 微调后的Mistral 7B模型在多层次加密货币新闻分析中表现出色，能够提供有价值的定性和定量分析见解。

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProLiFIC是一个从1987-2022年意大利立法过程的事件日志数据集，使用LLM从非结构化数据构建，旨在推动法律领域的过程挖掘研究


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程挖掘在工业领域应用成熟，但在法律领域受限于数据可访问性和质量，需要高质量的法律过程数据集来推动该领域研究

Method: 从Normattiva门户网站获取非结构化数据，使用大型语言模型(LLMs)进行结构化处理，构建意大利立法过程的事件日志

Result: 成功创建了ProLiFIC数据集，包含1987-2022年意大利立法过程的全面事件日志，为法律过程挖掘提供了基准数据集

Conclusion: ProLiFIC数据集可作为法律过程挖掘的基准，促进过程挖掘与大型语言模型的结合，推动法律领域过程分析的新发展

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

### [5] [Multimodal Proposal for an AI-Based Tool to Increase Cross-Assessment of Messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03529)
*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的多模态框架，通过将财报电话会议编码为层次化话语树，生成语义丰富且结构感知的嵌入表示，结合文本、音频、视频情感信号和结构化元数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有财务情感分析系统大多采用扁平化的文档级或句子级模型，无法捕捉财报电话会议这种半结构化金融通信的分层话语结构。

Method: 采用两阶段Transformer架构：第一阶段使用对比学习在节点级别编码多模态内容和话语元数据；第二阶段合成整个会议的全局嵌入。每个节点包含独白或问答对，并丰富情感信号和结构化元数据。

Result: 实验结果显示生成的嵌入形成稳定、语义有意义的表示，能够反映情感语调、结构逻辑和主题对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于财务报告，还可推广到其他高风险非脚本通信领域（如远程医疗、教育、政治话语），为多模态话语表示提供了稳健且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用转换器模型预测青少年自杀意念咊行为，通过分析论坛帖子在显示自杀意念前的内容，达到了73%的平衡准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年自杀是主要死因之一，但预测困难。许多案例因缺乏精神健康服务接触而未被发现。社交媒体为实时分析青少年的在线表达提供了机会

Method: 提出Early-SIB转换器模型，逐序处理用户写作咊参与的论坛帖子，预测是否会写出自杀意念咊行为内容，且在任何阶段都不使用自我曝露作为输入

Result: 在荷兰青年论坛上实现了预测未来自杀意念咊行为的0.73平衡准确率

Conclusion: 这种方法可以作为传统方法的有意义补充，在未显示自杀意念前就能预测青少年的自杀风险

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一种使用线性探针训练的实体级幻觉检测方法，能够在长文本生成中进行实时检测，性能超过现有基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险应用中的幻觉问题可能造成严重害备，而现有检测方法或者限于短词条查询，或者需要程度外部验证成本过高

Method: 通过网络搜索标注模型响应中的实体级幻觉，构建数据集训练简单高效的线性探针分类器，重点检测假造的名称、日期、引用等实体

Result: 在四个模型家族上评估，分类器在长文本响应中持续超过基线方法（如AUC 0.90 vs 0.71），甚至在数学推理任务中也能检测错误答案，显示了较广的泛化能力

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展的实际幻觉检测提供了有前景的新方案，虽然标注过程费用较高，但一个模型的标注数据可以用于训练其他模型的分类器，研究团队公开了数据集以便重用

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

### [8] [Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了UDIB方法，通过信息瓶颈原理改进语义分歧检测，用计算高效的上界替代难处理的KL散度，为LLM幻觉检测提供更敏感的工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分歧检测方法基于空间聚类优化主题识别，而非面向下游信息理论分析，存在优化目标与检测任务不匹配的问题。

Method: 基于确定性信息瓶颈(DIB)开发原则性主题识别方法，用计算高效的上界替代难处理的KL散度项，实现高维数据的实用算法UDIB。

Result: UDIB可解释为熵正则化和鲁棒化的K-means变体，能自动选择信息丰富的简约聚类数量，生成对提示-响应关系最大信息化的共享主题表示。

Conclusion: UDIB为语义分歧检测框架提供更优基础，提供了检测LLM幻觉的新型敏感工具，解决了空间聚类与信息理论分析之间的脱节问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

Abstract: In today's information-rich era, learners have access to abundant educational
resources, but the lack of practice materials tailored to these resources
presents a significant challenge. This project addresses that gap by developing
a multi-modal question generation system that can automatically generate
diverse question types from various content formats. The system features four
major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了AR²框架，通过对抗性强化学习增强LLM的抽象推理能力，使用教师模型将核心问题转化为复杂叙述，学生模型学习提取底层计算逻辑，显著提升模型在未见编程任务上的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成LLM主要关注表面模式识别，缺乏对抽象能力的显式训练，而抽象能力是计算机科学中的基础技能，对提升模型泛化能力至关重要。

Method: AR²框架：教师模型将核心问题转化为叙述丰富的挑战性描述（不改变基础逻辑），学生编码模型通过强化学习训练从复杂叙述中提取底层计算核心的能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，AR²显著提高了学生模型在先前未见、具有挑战性的编程任务上的准确性。

Conclusion: 抽象能力是增强LLM泛化能力的关键技能，AR²框架通过显式训练抽象推理有效提升了模型的编程问题解决能力。

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过动态构建知识图来增强LLM的事实性回答能力，结合内部知识提取和外部检索，在多个QA数据集上实现了更高的准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在产生事实一致性答案时的限制，传统RAG方法将知识作为非结构化文本处理，导致组合推理能力不足和事实不一致性问题

Method: 提出动态构建和扩展知识图的框架，通过提问提取种子KG，迭代使用LLM潜在知识扩展图结构，然后通过外部检索选择性精炼图谱，提高事实覆盖并纠正错误

Result: 在三个多样化事实QA测试集上，方法在事实准确性、答案精确度和可解释性方面均实现了持续改进，超越了基准提示和静态KG增强方法

Conclusion: 推理时知识图构建是一个有前景的方向，能够以结构化、可解释性和可扩展的方式提升LLM的事实性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

Result: 实验显示，尽管使用7B规模的代理，系统在语义对齐、结构一致性和视觉保真度方面始终优于GPT-4o等强基线。

Conclusion: ResearchPulse框架有效解决了多文档科学推理任务，并提供了相应的基准数据集ResearchPulse-Bench。

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

TL;DR: Sprinklr-Edge-OCR是一个专门为边缘计算优化的OCR系统，在资源受限环境下相比大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)具有显著优势，处理速度快35倍，成本仅为LVLMs的0.01%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言、噪声和多样化真实世界图像中的OCR挑战，特别是在资源受限的边缘部署环境中，传统OCR系统与新兴大型视觉语言模型的性能对比问题。

Method: 构建了Sprinklr-Edge-OCR系统，并在包含54种语言的双重人工标注数据集上，对5种最先进的LVLMs和2种传统OCR系统进行了大规模比较评估，涵盖准确性、语义一致性、语言覆盖、计算效率和部署成本等多个指标。

Result: Qwen获得最高精确度(0.54)，Sprinklr-Edge-OCR获得最佳整体F1分数(0.46)，处理速度比LVLMs快35倍(平均每图0.17秒)，成本仅为LVLMs的0.01%(每1000张图0.006美元)。

Conclusion: 即使在LLM时代，最适合边缘部署的OCR系统仍然是传统系统，因为它们具有低计算需求、低延迟和极高的经济性优势。

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM作为评估器存在自偏好偏差问题，本文通过轻量级转向向量在推理时缓解该问题，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型作为自动评估器时存在自偏好偏差，倾向于偏好自己的输出而非其他模型的输出，这影响了评估的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 构建区分合理与不合理自偏好的数据集，使用对比激活加法(CAA)和基于优化的方法构建转向向量。

Result: 转向向量可将不合理自偏好偏差降低97%，显著优于提示和直接偏好优化基线方法。

Conclusion: 转向向量在缓解自偏好偏差方面有前景但也有局限性，需要更鲁棒的干预措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

*Ali Noori,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了SNOMED CT概念共现模式与嵌入语义相似度的关系，发现两者弱相关但嵌入能捕获临床有意义的关联，可用于增强临床标注和发现潜在临床关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记的非结构化格式给大规模分析带来挑战，标准化术语如SNOMED CT提高了互操作性，但概念间通过共现和语义相似度的关系仍未被充分探索

Method: 利用MIMIC-IV数据库，使用标准化点互信息(NPMI)和预训练嵌入(ClinicalBERT, BioBERT)分析概念共现模式与语义相似度的关系，考察时间演变和专科差异

Result: 共现与语义相似度弱相关，但嵌入能捕获文档频率未反映的临床关联；嵌入建议常匹配后续文档概念；概念嵌入聚类产生连贯临床主题；共现模式与死亡率等结局相关

Conclusion: 共现统计和语义嵌入在提高文档完整性、发现潜在临床关系、支持决策和表型应用方面具有互补价值

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

TL;DR: 提出基于度量学习的少样本学习方法MLSD，用于跨目标和跨领域的立场检测，通过三元组损失构建判别性嵌入空间，在多个跨域场景中显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨目标和跨领域的立场检测问题，传统方法在新目标域中性能下降，需要能够有效适应新领域的方法

Method: 使用度量学习和三元组损失来捕捉立场目标之间的语义相似性和差异，构建判别性嵌入空间，从新目标域中获取有用示例

Result: 在两个数据集的多个跨目标和跨域场景中评估，相比六种广泛使用的立场检测模型，取得了统计显著的性能提升

Conclusion: MLSD方法通过度量学习有效提升了跨域立场检测的性能，证明了该方法在领域适应方面的有效性

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SiLVERScore新指标，直接在联合嵌入空间评估手语生成，避免传统回译评估的模糊性问题，在多个数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语生成评估采用回译方法（生成手语→识别为文本→文本比较），存在两个主要问题：1）无法捕捉手语的多模态特性（面部表情、空间语法、韵律）；2）难以区分错误来自生成模型还是翻译系统

Method: 提出SiLVERScore语义感知嵌入评估指标，在联合嵌入空间中直接评估手语生成，能够处理语义和韵律变化

Result: 在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上，SiLVERScore达到近乎完美的判别性能（ROC AUC = 0.99，重叠率<7%），显著优于传统指标

Conclusion: SiLVERScore为手语生成提供了更准确、语义感知的评估方法，解决了传统评估管道的模糊性问题，具有更好的鲁棒性和判别能力

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个四指标的评估套件，用于系统评估大型视觉语言模型在交互式基础设置中的表现，发现当前模型在多个指标上都与人类表现存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的评测标准主要考察单轮或问答场景，而基础设置是一个交互过程，需要通过持续沟通形成共享理解。

Method: 开发了四个指标（基础效率、内容对齐、词汇适应性和人类相似度），在150个自我对战会话中对三款专有大型视觉语言模型进行测试，并与人类对比。

Result: 三款模型在至少三个指标上都与人类模式存在分异，GPT4o-mini整体最接近人类。发现任务成功并不肯定表示成功基础，高图像-语句对齐也不肯定预测任务成功。

Conclusion: 该指标套件和发现为未来的大型视觉语言模型基础研究提供了框架。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Align-then-Slide框架，用于评估超长文档级机器翻译，通过自动对齐句子级对应关系和滑动窗口评估，与人工评估高度相关，并能用于训练更好的翻译模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文档级机器翻译中产生整篇文档输出，挑战了传统的逐句对齐评估方法，需要新的评估框架来处理遗漏和多对一/一对多映射问题。

Method: Align-then-Slide框架包含两个阶段：1) Align阶段自动推断句子级源-目标对应关系并重建目标文本；2) n-Chunk滑动评估阶段计算1-4个块的平均度量分数进行多粒度评估。

Result: 在WMT基准测试中与专家MQM排名的Pearson相关性达到0.929，在新构建的真实测试集上也与人工判断高度一致。使用该框架产生的偏好数据能够有效训练CPO和作为GRPO的奖励模型，产生优于普通SFT基线的翻译。

Conclusion: 该框架是文档级机器翻译系统中准确、稳健且可操作的评估工具，能够有效解决长文档翻译评估的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出NE-PADD方法，通过语音命名实体识别和注意力机制提升部分音频深度伪造检测的帧级定位能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频深度伪造检测只在句子级别，而部分音频伪造检测需要帧级定位。现有方法在利用音频语义信息特别是命名实体方面研究不足

Method: 提出NE-PADD方法，包含两个并行分支：语音命名实体识别(SpeechNER)和PADD检测。采用注意力融合(AF)和注意力转移(AT)两种机制，通过辅助损失利用命名实体语义指导检测

Result: 在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线，证明了整合命名实体知识的有效性

Conclusion: 命名实体知识可以有效提升部分音频深度伪造检测的性能，NE-PADD方法为这一领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Drivelology（废话学）这一独特语言现象，即表面看似无意义但蕴含深层含义的表述。研究发现当前大语言模型在处理这类文本时存在明显局限，无法理解其多层次语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索大语言模型在处理具有深层含义但表面看似无意义的特殊语言现象时的能力局限，挑战统计流畅性等同于认知理解的假设。

Method: 构建了包含1200多个精心筛选的多语言Drivelology示例数据集，通过专家评审和多轮讨论进行标注，并评估了多种大语言模型在分类、生成和推理任务上的表现。

Result: 研究结果显示大语言模型存在明显局限性：经常将Drivelology与浅层无意义内容混淆，产生不连贯的辩解，或完全忽略隐含的修辞功能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在语用理解方面存在深层次表征差距，表明统计流畅性并不等同于认知理解能力。发布数据集和代码以促进超越表面连贯性的语言深度建模研究。

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维链推理技术提升了LLM在多项任务上的性能，但其对语言模型可信度影响的系统性研究仍不充分，需要从多维度全面评估推理技术的可信度问题。

Method: 采用文献综述方法，按时间顺序系统梳理推理模型和CoT技术相关研究，从五个核心可信维度（真实性、安全性、鲁棒性、公平性、隐私性）进行分析，总结方法、发现和局限性。

Result: 研究发现推理技术虽能通过减少幻觉、检测有害内容和提升鲁棒性来增强模型可信度，但最先进的推理模型本身在安全性、鲁棒性和隐私性方面存在可比甚至更严重的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI安全社区提供了关于推理可信度最新进展的宝贵资源，强调了在推进推理技术的同时需要关注其自身的安全脆弱性问题，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能遵循有害指令引发安全隐患，现有研究使用探针方法分析恶意和良性输入在模型内部表示的可分离性，但作者发现这些方法存在分布外性能差的问题

Method: 通过控制实验验证假设：首先展示简单n-gram方法的可比性能，然后使用语义清洗数据集进行控制实验，最后详细分析模式依赖性

Result: 确认探针学习的是指令模式和触发词等表面模式，而非语义危害性，揭示了当前基于探针方法的安全检测存在根本缺陷

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了当前基于探针方法的安全感是虚假的，需要重新设计模型和评估协议，为负责任的研究方向提供建议

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

Motivation: 当前LLM移动代理存在三个主要问题：1)过度依赖LLM理解能力导致操作错误或步骤遗漏 2)缺乏外部环境交互，当应用无法满足查询时任务终止 3)缺少记忆能力，每次指令都需重新构建界面且无法从错误中学习

Method: 提出MobileRAG框架，包含三个RAG增强组件：InterRAG（交互RAG）、LocalRAG（本地RAG）、MemRAG（记忆RAG），利用RAG技术更快速准确地识别用户查询并完成复杂长序列移动任务

Result: 在MobileRAG-Eval基准测试中，MobileRAG能够轻松处理真实世界移动任务，比最先进方法提升10.3%的性能，且使用更少的操作步骤

Conclusion: MobileRAG通过RAG增强有效解决了现有移动代理的局限性，在复杂移动任务处理上表现出色，为移动代理的发展提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Motivation: 现有方法如Chain-of-Thought和Tree-of-Thought在处理复杂抽象问答任务时存在冗余和单一路径问题，RAG方法在利用多实体多跳信息方面仍有挑战。

Method: 提出MoT思维结构，通过"列-单元通信"机制在水平和垂直维度探索问题，构建知识单元进行事实校正，开发MTQA问答框架。

Result: 在四个常用数据集上F1和EM分数优于最先进方法，推理时间仅为基线方法的14.4%，证明高效性和准确性。

Conclusion: MoT方法有效提升了LLM在复杂问答任务中的推理能力，通过多策略深度思考和知识校正机制实现了性能的显著提升。

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在文本情感分类方面取得显著进步，但诗歌特别是韩国诗歌因其比哉语言和文化特定性而被忽略，需要专门的数据集来支持计算分析。

Method: 构建包含7,662条目的多标签情感数据集，其中7,007条行级和655条作品级注释，采用44个细粒度情感类别。采用三步精调策略：首先在通用语料上训练，然后在KPoEM数据集上继续精调。

Result: 细调后的韩语模型显著超过基础模型，F1微指标从0.34提升到0.60。模型能够识别时间和文化特定的情感表达，同时保留现代韩国诗歌的核心情感。

Conclusion: KPoEM数据集和相应模型为韩国文学情感的定量分析提供了新可能，平档了计算方法与文学分析，能够准确保留韩国文学的情感和文化细腻。

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

Result: 大量实验表明SelfAug在下游学习和通用能力保持之间实现了优越的平衡。实证分析揭示了分布偏移与RAG场景中灾难性遗忘严重程度之间的直接相关性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅推进了对RAG背景下灾难性遗忘的理解，还提供了一个适用于各种微调场景的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

### [29] [SPFT-SQL: Enhancing Large Language Model for Text-to-SQL Parsing by Self-Play Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03937)
*Yuhao Zhang,Shaoming Duan,Jinhang Su,Chuanyi Liu,Peiyi Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL是一种针对Text-to-SQL任务的自博弈微调方法，通过验证驱动的迭代微调和错误驱动的损失函数，解决了传统SPIN方法在SQL生成中的局限性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自博弈微调(SPIN)在Text-to-SQL任务中存在局限性：无法生成新信息，且对手模型产生的大量正确SQL查询会降低主模型生成准确SQL的能力。

Method: 提出SPFT-SQL方法：1）自博弈前采用验证驱动的迭代微调，基于数据库模式和验证反馈合成高质量训练数据；2）自博弈阶段引入错误驱动损失函数，激励对手模型产生错误输出，帮助主模型区分正确和错误SQL。

Result: 在6个开源大语言模型和5个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL通过针对性的改进有效解决了SPIN在Text-to-SQL任务中的挑战，显著提升了SQL生成准确性。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoxRole是首个专门用于评估基于语音的角色扮演对话代理的综合性基准测试，包含13335个多轮对话、65.6小时语音数据，涵盖1228个独特角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演对话代理研究存在两个主要局限：一是主要关注文本模态，忽略了语音中的副语言特征；二是缺乏标准化的评估基准，现有数据集无法有效量化角色一致性等核心能力。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的两阶段自动化流程：首先将电影音频与剧本对齐，然后使用LLM为每个角色系统性地构建多维角色档案。

Result: 基于VoxRole基准对当代口语对话模型进行了多维评估，揭示了它们在保持角色一致性方面的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: VoxRole填补了语音角色扮演领域标准化评估基准的空白，为未来研究提供了重要的评估工具和数据集资源。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CANDY基准测试评估大语言模型在中文谣言检测中的能力，发现当前LLMs在事实核查方面存在局限，特别是事实捏造问题，但作为辅助工具仍有潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在中文谣言事实核查方面的有效性和局限性，尽管LLMs使用日益广泛，但其事实核查能力仍不确定。

Method: 构建包含约2万条标注实例的CANDY基准数据集，使用思维链推理和少样本提示技术测试LLMs，并开发分类法分析错误解释。

Result: 当前LLMs在生成准确事实核查结论方面存在局限，即使使用增强技术；事实捏造是最常见的失败模式；LLMs作为辅助工具可显著提升人类表现。

Conclusion: LLMs单独用于事实核查不可靠，但在作为人类辅助工具的场景中具有巨大潜力，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

TL;DR: 本文针对低资源语言Ladin，通过翻译意大利语数据创建合成数据集，用于情感分析和多项选择题问答，并证明这些数据能显著提升机器翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在极低资源语言（如土著语言）上效果不佳，主要原因是缺乏标注数据。Ladin作为一种濒危的罗曼语族语言，缺乏高质量NLP数据集，难以开发稳健的语言技术。

Method: 利用少量Ladin-意大利语平行句对，通过翻译意大利语单语数据创建合成数据集。采用严格的过滤和回译程序确保语言质量和可靠性。

Result: 将合成数据集融入机器翻译训练后，相比现有意大利语-Ladin翻译基线获得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 贡献了首个公开可用的Ladin情感分析和MCQA数据集，为这种代表性不足的语言建立了基础资源，支持更广泛的NLP研究和下游应用。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTQA是一个新颖的时序知识图谱问答框架，通过递归分解问题、自底向上求解和多路径答案聚合，显著提升了复杂时序查询的处理能力，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时序知识图谱问答方法主要关注隐式时序约束，缺乏处理复杂时序查询的能力，且在分解框架中存在推理能力有限和错误传播的问题。

Method: RTQA包含三个核心组件：时序问题分解器、递归求解器和答案聚合器。采用递归思维将问题分解为子问题，使用LLMs和TKG知识自底向上求解，并通过多路径答案聚合提高容错性。

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA基准测试中，RTQA在"Multiple"和"Complex"类别上实现了显著的Hits@1改进，优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: RTQA框架通过递归分解和聚合策略有效解决了复杂时序知识图谱问答的挑战，无需训练即可实现优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM对语言变异的鲁棒性，检验基准测试是否能可靠衡量模型在实际应用中的能力。

Method: 系统生成六个常用基准测试中所有问题的多种改写版本，测试34个不同规模和性能的先进LLM在这些改写问题上的表现变化。

Result: LLM排名相对稳定，但绝对效果分数显著下降，表明模型难以处理语言变异，基准测试高分不能完全代表实际部署的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 需要开发考虑鲁棒性的基准测试，更好地反映实际部署场景，当前基准测试方法存在局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

Motivation: 系统功能语法在中文文本分析中缺乏自动化注释工具，限制了相关理论的应用和推广。

Method: 使用人民日报语料库进行手动注释，构建训练数据集，并对RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext模型进行微调实现命名实体识别任务。

Conclusion: 该研究为中文功能语法自动分析提供了新方法，为后续研究奠定了基础，是功能语法与注意力NLP模型的首次结合。

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19

massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了隐含叙事检测和解释生成的挑战，通过知识增强方法显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Method: 通过变更语料量和词汇模型中各词性类别的项目数量，使用回归率、覆盖率和余弦相似度指标评估模型在时间上的性能。

Result: 最优配置是使用10分钟语料，形容词和连词各5个项目，副词、名词、代词和动词各10个项目的简洁模型，在性能和数据效率方面取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 这研究为构建稳定的个性化词汇模型提供了实用见解，考虑了最小数据需求，是实现对话机器人词汇对齐策略的基础步骤。

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了同时建模实体和篇章关系的两种方法，实验表明整合这两种特征能显著提升连贯性评估模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连贯性建模研究大多只关注实体特征或篇章关系特征，很少将两者结合起来，而语言学中连贯性可以通过多种方式实现

Method: 提出了两种联合建模实体和篇章关系的方法来进行连贯性评估

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，整合两种特征显著提升了连贯性模型的性能

Conclusion: 同时建模实体和篇章关系对于连贯性评估具有重要价值，整合两种特征能带来显著性能提升

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAGneT是一个多智能体框架，用于生成高质量的心理咨询对话数据，通过分解咨询任务到专门的LLM智能体来模拟真实咨询结构，显著提升了生成会话的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对可扩展心理咨询需求的增长，需要高质量、隐私合规的数据来微调开源大语言模型，但此类数据稀缺。现有单智能体方法难以捕捉真实咨询的结构和细微差别。

Method: 提出MAGneT多智能体框架，将咨询师回应生成分解为协调的子任务，由专门模拟关键心理技术的LLM智能体处理。同时提出统一的评估框架，整合多种自动和专家指标，将评估维度从4个扩展到9个。

Result: MAGneT在生成咨询会话的质量、多样性和治疗对齐方面显著优于现有方法，平均提升一般咨询技能3.2%、CBT特定技能4.3%。专家在77.2%的情况下偏好MAGneT生成的会话。使用MAGneT数据微调的模型性能更好，平均提升一般咨询技能6.3%、CBT特定技能7.3%。

Conclusion: MAGneT框架能有效生成高质量的心理咨询合成数据，解决了数据稀缺问题，为心理咨询LLM的微调提供了优质数据源，同时建立了更全面的评估标准。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SED-Aug是一个用于社交媒体事件检测的双重增强框架，通过显式文本增强和隐式特征空间增强来提升数据多样性和模型鲁棒性，在两个Twitter数据集上F1分数分别提升约17.67%和15.57%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体事件检测依赖标注数据，但人工标注成本高且劳动密集，需要解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 提出双重增强框架：显式增强使用大语言模型进行5种文本生成策略；隐式增强设计5种新颖的特征空间扰动技术，在结构融合嵌入上操作，保持语义和关系属性。

Result: 在Twitter2012数据集上平均F1分数比最佳基线模型提升约17.67%，在Twitter2018数据集上提升约15.57%。

Conclusion: SED-Aug框架有效提升了社交媒体事件检测性能，通过双重增强策略解决了数据稀缺问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

TL;DR: 提出了Inverse IFEval基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在对抗性指令下的反直觉能力，发现现有模型存在认知惯性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在监督微调后往往表现出认知惯性，难以遵循与训练模式相冲突的指令，需要评估这种局限性

Method: 构建包含8类挑战的1012个中英文问题数据集，使用人类参与流程和优化的LLM-as-a-Judge框架进行评估

Result: 实验表明现有领先LLMs在反直觉能力方面存在不足，验证了Inverse IFEval基准的必要性

Conclusion: 未来对齐工作不仅要追求流畅性和事实准确性，还应考虑非常规情境下的适应性，Inverse IFEval可作为诊断工具和改进方法的基础

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 该研究创建了两个医学问答数据集来评估LLMs对过时医学知识的依赖问题，发现所有主流模型都存在依赖过时知识的问题，并分析了原因和提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用潜力巨大，但其依赖静态训练数据的特性存在风险，当医学知识更新时，模型可能提供有害的建议或在临床推理任务中失败。

Method: 引入了两个新颖的问答数据集：MedRevQA（16,501个QA对，涵盖一般生物医学知识）和MedChangeQA（512个QA对，医学共识随时间变化的子集），评估了八个主流LLM模型。

Result: 所有模型都表现出对过时知识的一致依赖，分析了过时预训练数据和训练策略的影响。

Conclusion: 为开发更及时可靠的医疗AI系统奠定了基础，提出了缓解这一问题的未来方向。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO是一种改进的上下文ASR系统，通过音素增强编码、对比实体消歧和分层实体过滤，显著提升了特定领域命名实体（特别是同音词）的识别准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR系统在处理领域特定命名实体时表现不佳，特别是同音词问题。现有上下文ASR方法由于实体多样性有限，难以捕捉细粒度音素变化，且将实体视为独立标记导致多标记偏置不完整

Method: 提出PARCO方法，整合音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤四个组件，增强音素区分能力，确保完整实体检索，并在不确定性下减少误报

Result: 在中文AISHELL-1上达到4.22%的CER，在英文DATA2上达到11.14%的WER（1000个干扰项条件下），显著优于基线方法。在THCHS-30和LibriSpeech等域外数据集上也表现出稳健增益

Conclusion: PARCO通过音素增强和对比学习机制，有效解决了上下文ASR中的实体识别问题，特别是在处理同音词和多标记实体方面表现出色，具有很好的泛化能力

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

*Bufan Gao,Elisa Kreiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，即使微小的提示词变化也能显著改变偏见测量结果，有时甚至完全反转偏见方向。离散选择指标相比概率指标会放大偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会影响场景中的广泛应用，性别偏见问题日益受到关注。当前评估方法通常使用特殊构造的任务提示来测量偏见，但这些提示可能与自然语言分布不同，可能触发模型的"测试模式"。

Method: 研究测试了在不同提示条件下的模型表现：(1)使测试情境显著，(2)使性别相关内容显著。使用四种任务格式，结合token概率和离散选择指标进行评估。

Result: 发现即使微小的提示变化也能显著改变偏见结果，有时完全反转偏见方向。离散选择指标倾向于放大偏见。

Conclusion: 研究结果不仅揭示了LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，还为NLP基准测试提出了新问题：良好控制的测试设计在多大程度上会触发LLM的"测试模式"，这对未来基准测试的生态有效性意味着什么。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性评估了开源语言模型在日本历法处理能力上的表现，发现即使日语中心模型也在历法运算和多历法一致性方面遇到困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的研究分析了语言模型的时间理解能力，但大多数研究仅聚焦于公历，而忽视了体现文化特色时间观念的非公历系统。日本历作为一种活跃使用的非公历系统，其处理能力尚未经过系统评估。

Method: 研究者为日本历创建了四个需要时间知识和时间理解的任务数据集，对一系列英语中心和日语中心的开源语言模型进行了系统性评测。

Result: 结果显示某些模型能够进行历法转换，但即使是日语中心的模型也在日本历的数学运算以及在不同历法之间保持一致性方面表现差强。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了开发更好地处理文化特定历法理解的语言模型的重要性，并指出当前模型在处理非公历系统时仍面临重大挑战。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

TL;DR: 研究通过模拟AI偏见实验发现，人们在与带种族偏见的AI协作时，会显著向AI偏好的种族群体倾斜，即使认为AI建议质量低也会受影响。完成隐性联想测试可减少这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查人们在与带有种族偏见的AI系统协作时的行为变化，以及隐性联想测试在人工智能协作决策中的作用。

Method: 进行简历筛选实验(N=528)，使用模拟的带有种族偏见的AI模型，评估16种高低地位职业的合适者。模拟AI偏见基于真实世界AI系统的种族偏见估计。测量参与者的隐性联想测试(IATs)并分析1526个场景。

Result: 在与偏向某种族群体的AI协作时，人们选择该群体的概率高达90%。完成IAT测试后，选择不符合种族-地位定型的合适者概率提高13%。即使认为AI建议质量低，人们的决策仍受AI偏见影响。

Conclusion: 这项研究对人工智能人在循环(HITL)场景中的自主性、AI与工作、招聘系统设计和偏见减少策略具有重要意义。组织和监管政策应考虑AI-HITL决策的复杂性。

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people
collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)
to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI
bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in
real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,
Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups
on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their
unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association
tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been
investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or
with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates
at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,
people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a
significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose
identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%
if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if
people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their
decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This
work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,
design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias
in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and
regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision
making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and
determining which are subject to oversight.

*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种基于奇异值分解的多模态参数高效适应方法，仅需微调CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值，使用0.04%的参数就能实现卓越的领域适应性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型适应方法依赖提示工程和全模型微调，成本高且可能破坏预训练知识。需要一种更高效、稳定的适应技术。

Method: 利用奇异值分解(SVD)修改CLIP内部参数空间，仅微调参数矩阵的奇异值来重新缩放基向量，实现领域适应而不注入额外模块。

Result: 在11个自然数据集和10个生物医学数据集上达到最先进的分类结果，在少样本设置下准确率和泛化能力均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD提供了一种参数高效、性能优越且可解释的CLIP适应方法，在保持预训练知识的同时实现了卓越的领域适应效果。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly

TL;DR: SPECS是一个针对长图像描述任务设计的无参考评估指标，通过改进CLIP模型来强调特异性，在保持与人类判断高度相关的同时大幅提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标存在问题：n-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，基于表示的相似性指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，LLM指标虽然相关性强但计算成本过高，不适合模型开发中的迭代使用

Method: 改进CLIP模型，引入新的目标函数来强调特异性——奖励正确细节并惩罚错误细节，从而构建SPECS指标

Result: SPECS在相关性方面与开源LLM指标相当，但计算效率显著更高，适合在图像描述模型开发中进行迭代检查点评估

Conclusion: SPECS提供了一个实用高效的替代方案，能够在保持评估质量的同时支持图像描述模型开发过程中的快速迭代

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

TL;DR: 研究发现大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中对提示词设计极其敏感，微小变化可导致15%的准确率差异，提出了Promptception框架系统评估提示词敏感性，并为不同模型类型提供了针对性的提示原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示词设计缺乏系统研究，模型性能对提示词微小变化极其敏感，这影响了模型评估的透明性和公平性。

Method: 提出了Promptception框架，包含61种提示类型、15个类别和6个超类别，用于评估10个不同规模的大型多模态模型在3个多项选择题基准测试上的表现。

Result: 专有模型对提示词语义更敏感但性能更好，开源模型更稳定但处理复杂提示词能力较弱，提示词变化可导致高达15%的准确率差异。

Conclusion: 需要针对专有和开源模型制定不同的提示原则，以实现更稳健和公平的模型评估，提示词敏感性是评估大型多模态模型性能的重要维度。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型面临日益复杂的安全挑战，但现有的风险导向数据集构建方法无法覆盖真实世界多模态安全场景的复杂性，且缺乏统一的评估指标。

Method: 采用面向图像的自适应数据集构建方法，从图像出发构建配对的文本和指导响应，自动生成包含35k图像-文本对的数据集，并引入基于安全判断模型微调的标准化评估指标。

Result: 在各种任务上的广泛实验证明了所提方法的有效性，结果证实了面向图像方法的可扩展性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为真实世界多模态安全数据集的构建提供了新的视角，能够有效应对多模态大语言模型的安全挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了UCF-UM框架，通过循环评估协议量化统一视觉语言模型在图像-文本交替生成中的语义漂移，揭示了现有单次评估无法发现的跨模态一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法将视觉理解和生成能力分开评估，无法揭示模型在跨模态循环转换中是否能保持语义一致性，需要新的评估框架来量化语义漂移。

Method: 引入UCF-UM循环评估协议，通过交替进行I2T和T2I多代生成来评估语义漂移，提出三个指标：MCD（平均累积漂移）、SDR（语义漂移率）和MGG（多代GenEval）。

Result: 评估了7个最新模型，发现跨模态稳定性存在显著差异：BAGEL能在多次交替中保持语义，而Vila-u尽管单次评分高但漂移迅速。创建了ND400新基准数据集。

Conclusion: 循环一致性评估是标准I2T和T2I评估的必要补充，UCF-UM提供了实用指标来系统评估统一模型的跨模态稳定性和共享表示强度。

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

### [57] [LibriQuote: A Speech Dataset of Fictional Character Utterances for Expressive Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04072)
*Gaspard Michel,Elena V. Epure,Christophe Cerisara*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: LibriQuote是一个从有声读物中提取的英语语料库，包含12.7K小时非表达性语音和5.3K小时表达性语音，用于微调和基准测试零样本TTS系统，并提供带上下文和伪标签的丰富标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模语音数据集中表达性语音比例不明确，且现有表达性语音语料库规模较小，主要用于TTS系统基准测试，需要更大规模的表达性语音数据集来提升TTS系统的表现力。

Method: 从朗读的有声读物中构建LibriQuote数据集，包含非表达性和表达性语音子集，为表达性语音提供上下文描述和伪标签（如说话动词和副词），并设计专门的测试集用于评估TTS系统在保持音色同时合成表达性语音的能力。

Result: 主观和客观评估表明，在LibriQuote上微调的基线TTS系统显著提高了合成语音的可懂度，现有系统难以合成与真实语音一样表达性和自然的语音。测试集涵盖了广泛的情感和口音变化。

Conclusion: LibriQuote数据集为表达性零样本TTS系统的训练和评估提供了有价值的资源，证明了大规模表达性语音数据对提升TTS系统性能的重要性，现有系统在表达性语音合成方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and
natural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the
proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear.
Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and
primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the
LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed
for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The
training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K
hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each
utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it
was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to
describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally,
we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS
systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's
ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference
timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide
range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various
accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a
baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech
intelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as
expressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances. The dataset and
evaluation code are freely available. Audio samples can be found at

Motivation: 推理需要在有限数据和分布偏移下适应新问题设置，现有测试平台无法充分评估AI系统在这种挑战性环境下的推理能力

Method: 基于结构因果模型构建完全指定的因果世界模型，生成CausalARC推理任务，通过原则性数据增强提供观察、干预和反事实的少样本上下文学习演示

Result: 作为概念验证，展示了CausalARC在四个语言模型评估场景中的应用：测试时训练的抽象推理、上下文学习的反事实推理、程序合成以及逻辑推理的因果发现

Conclusion: CausalARC为评估AI系统在低数据和分布外环境中的推理能力提供了一个形式化、可控制的测试平台，特别适用于因果推理和少样本学习的研究

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理方面存在错误，缺乏人类一样的健壮心智表征，需要基于体验的认知基础来改善

Method: 开发了一个原型神经符号系统Embodied-LM，利用图像模式来基础理解和逻辑推理，通过Answer Set Programming进行声明式空间推理

Result: 证明大语言模型可以被引导通过体验认知结构来解释场景，这些结构可以形式化为可执行程序，并支持有效的逻辑推理且提升了可解释性

Conclusion: 虽然当前实现主要关注空间原语，但为融合更复杂和动态表征的认知结构奠定了计算基础

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了强化学习提升大语言模型推理能力的机制：存在类似人类认知的层次化推理结构，包含高层策略规划和低层程序执行两个阶段，并提出了针对高层规划令牌优化的HICRA算法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习被证明能有效提升大语言模型的复杂推理能力，但其成功背后的机制仍然不明确，需要深入理解学习过程中的关键现象和动态变化

Method: 通过分析发现推理层次结构的存在，提出HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA)算法，专注于高层规划令牌的优化，并使用语义熵作为策略探索的衡量指标

Result: HICRA算法显著优于现有基线方法，证明关注策略瓶颈是解锁高级推理的关键，语义熵被验证为比令牌级熵更优越的策略探索度量指标

Conclusion: 强化学习提升LLM推理能力的关键在于识别和优化层次化推理结构中的高层策略规划阶段，HICRA算法通过针对性信用分配有效提升了学习效率

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究系统分析了LLM人格特质的三个维度：训练过程中的动态演化、自报特质对行为的预测有效性、以及人格注入干预的影响，发现自报特质与行为表现存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs显示出类似人类的人格特质模式，但先前研究主要依赖简化的自报告和启发式提示，缺乏行为验证，需要系统性地理解LLM人格特质的本质。

Method: 通过三个维度系统分析LLM人格：训练阶段特质配置的动态演化、自报特质在行为任务中的预测效度、以及人格注入等干预措施对自报告和行为的影响。

Result: 指令对齐（如RLHF、指令调优）显著稳定特质表达并增强特质相关性，但自报特质不能可靠预测行为，人格注入能引导自报告但对实际行为影响有限或不一致。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了关于LLM人格的假设，强调需要区分表面特质表达与行为一致性，在对齐和可解释性方面需要更深层次的评估。

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human behavior.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar patterns may
emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying consistent
behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

TL;DR: CoT-Space框架将LLM推理重新定义为连续语义空间中的优化过程，从噪声和风险角度分析，证明了最优CoT长度收敛是欠拟合与过拟合权衡的自然结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统token级RL框架无法与多步推理过程（如Chain-of-Thought）的推理级性质对齐，存在理论空白。

Method: 引入CoT-Space理论框架，将LLM推理从离散token预测任务重新构建为连续推理级语义空间中的优化过程，从噪声和风险两个角度进行分析。

Result: 理论分析表明最优CoT长度收敛是欠拟合与过拟合权衡的自然结果，大量实验为理论发现提供了强有力实证验证。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅为过度思考等经验现象提供了连贯解释，还为开发更有效、可泛化的推理智能体奠定了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

Abstract: Formalizing cooking procedures remains a challenging task due to their

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将心理学理论（如MBTI）与LLM行为设计相结合，通过人格条件化来增强LLM代理的有效性和行为控制

Method: 使用提示工程为LLM代理注入不同人格原型（MBTI类型），控制认知和情感两个心理学基础轴的行为表现，并集成16Personalities测试进行自动化验证

Result: 人格条件化在不同任务中产生一致、可解释的行为偏差：情感表达型代理在叙事生成中表现优异，分析型代理在博弈论设置中采用更稳定的策略，自我反思能提高合作和推理质量

Conclusion: 该框架为心理增强的AI代理奠定了基础，无需微调即可实现，且方法可推广到其他心理学框架（如Big Five、HEXACO、Enneagram）

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种概念级外部记忆方法，通过从推理轨迹中提取可重用的模块化抽象概念，在测试时实现持续学习而无需权重更新，在ARC-AGI基准上相对基线提升7.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时扩展方法虽然能生成更长的推理轨迹，但这些洞察在上下文重置后立即丢失。外部记忆可以持久化这些发现，但现有方法多基于实例级记忆，缺乏可重用性和扩展性。

Method: 提出概念级记忆方法：从解决方案轨迹中提取可重用的模块化自然语言抽象概念；设计新的抽象策略从rollout中提取要点；选择性检索相关概念集成到新查询提示中；支持测试时动态更新记忆。

Result: 在挑战性ARC-AGI基准上相对强无记忆基线获得7.5%相对提升；性能随推理计算量持续扩展；抽象概念在所有测试推理计算规模上都优于基线；动态更新记忆优于固定记忆设置。

Conclusion: 概念级记忆方法有效提升了LLM的推理能力，支持测试时持续学习和自我改进，证明了抽象概念作为记忆设计的优越性和可扩展性。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient
framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

Conclusion: 本文的理论框架统一了RL和SFT方法，提出的HPT算法能够有效结合演示利用和探索稳定性，在数学推理任务上取得显著提升

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled

We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

Motivation: 识别RAG系统的关键漏洞：大语言模型可能吸收和重现检索到的错误信息，尤其在检索到恶意攻击材料时。重点关注健康领域，因为错误回答可能造成严重害害。

Method: 进行受控实验，使用常见健康问题，变化检索文档类型（有帮助的、有害的、恶意的）和问题框架（一致的、中立的、不一致的），评估模型输出与真实答案的一致性。

Result: 恶意文档显著降低了模型输出与真实答案的一致性，但当检索集中同时包含有用证据时，系统稳健性可以得以保持。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计更安全的RAG系统提供了可操作的见解，强调了在高风险领域建立检索安全保障的必要性。所有实验结果公开以便复现和促进未来研究。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github
repository.

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER
Retriever Codebase is publicly available at

Abstract: Query spelling correction is an important function of modern search engines
since it effectively helps users express their intentions clearly. With the
growing popularity of speech search driven by Automated Speech Recognition
(ASR) systems, this paper introduces a novel method named Contextualized Token
Discrimination (CTD) to conduct effective speech query correction. In CTD, we
first employ BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations and
then construct a composition layer to enhance semantic information. Finally, we
produce the correct query according to the aggregated token representation,
correcting the incorrect tokens by comparing the original token representations
and the contextualized representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed method across all metrics, and we further
present a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions to offer
comprehensive evaluations for audio query correction.
