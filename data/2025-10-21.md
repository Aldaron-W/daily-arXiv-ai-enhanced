### [1] [Quantum NLP models on Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15972)
*Ling Sun,Peter Sullivan,Michael Martin,Yun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究量子自然语言处理在自然语言推理任务中的应用，比较量子、混合和经典模型在少样本设置下的表现，引入信息增益参数比指标评估学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子自然语言处理在语义建模中的潜力，特别是在低资源、结构敏感场景下，通过量子电路直接嵌入组合结构来实现高效的语义表示。

Method: 使用lambeq库和DisCoCat框架构建参数化量子电路处理句子对，训练语义相关性和推理分类任务，并提出基于聚类的架构来促进参数共享。

Result: 量子模型在参数数量大幅减少的情况下达到与经典基线相当的性能，在推理任务上优于随机初始化的transformer模型，并且每参数学习效率比经典模型高出五个数量级。

Conclusion: 量子自然语言处理在低资源、结构敏感场景中展现出巨大潜力，量子模型具有显著更高的参数效率，提出的聚类架构进一步提升了泛化能力。

Abstract: Quantum natural language processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
semantic modeling by embedding compositional structure directly into quantum
circuits. This paper investigates the application of QNLP models to the task of
Natural Language Inference (NLI), comparing quantum, hybrid, and classical
transformer-based models under a constrained few-shot setting. Using the lambeq
library and the DisCoCat framework, we construct parameterized quantum circuits
for sentence pairs and train them for both semantic relatedness and inference
classification. To assess efficiency, we introduce a novel
information-theoretic metric, Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP), which
quantifies learning dynamics independent of model size. Our results demonstrate
that quantum models achieve performance comparable to classical baselines while
operating with dramatically fewer parameters. The Quantum-based models
outperform randomly initialized transformers in inference and achieve lower
test error on relatedness tasks. Moreover, quantum models exhibit significantly
higher per-parameter learning efficiency (up to five orders of magnitude more
than classical counterparts), highlighting the promise of QNLP in low-resource,
structure-sensitive settings. To address circuit-level isolation and promote
parameter sharing, we also propose a novel cluster-based architecture that
improves generalization by tying gate parameters to learned word clusters
rather than individual tokens.

### [2] [Fusion-Augmented Large Language Models: Boosting Diagnostic Trustworthiness via Model Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16057)
*Md Kamrul Siam,Md Jobair Hossain Faruk,Jerry Q. Cheng,Huanying Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于ChatGPT和Claude的多模型融合框架，通过相似性共识方法提升胸片诊断准确性，在单模态和多模态条件下均优于单一模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高AI辅助放射学诊断的可靠性和临床实用性，减少诊断错误，同时保持较低计算开销。

Method: 使用ChatGPT和Claude两种大语言模型，采用相似性共识方法（95%输出相似度阈值），在CheXpert数据集上评估单模态（仅图像）和多模态（图像+合成临床笔记）性能。

Result: 单模态：ChatGPT准确率62.8%，Claude准确率76.9%，共识方法提升至77.6%；多模态：ChatGPT提升至84%，Claude为76%，共识准确率达91.3%。

Conclusion: 多模型融合和输出级共识能显著提升AI辅助放射学诊断的准确性和可信度，为减少诊断错误提供了实用路径。

Abstract: This study presents a novel multi-model fusion framework leveraging two
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT and Claude, to enhance
the reliability of chest X-ray interpretation on the CheXpert dataset. From the
full CheXpert corpus of 224,316 chest radiographs, we randomly selected 234
radiologist-annotated studies to evaluate unimodal performance using image-only
prompts. In this setting, ChatGPT and Claude achieved diagnostic accuracies of
62.8% and 76.9%, respectively. A similarity-based consensus approach, using a
95% output similarity threshold, improved accuracy to 77.6%. To assess the
impact of multimodal inputs, we then generated synthetic clinical notes
following the MIMIC-CXR template and evaluated a separate subset of 50 randomly
selected cases paired with both images and synthetic text. On this multimodal
cohort, performance improved to 84% for ChatGPT and 76% for Claude, while
consensus accuracy reached 91.3%. Across both experimental conditions,
agreement-based fusion consistently outperformed individual models. These
findings highlight the utility of integrating complementary modalities and
using output-level consensus to improve the trustworthiness and clinical
utility of AI-assisted radiological diagnosis, offering a practical path to
reduce diagnostic errors with minimal computational overhead.

### [3] [Can LLMs Correct Themselves? A Benchmark of Self-Correction in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16062)
*Guiyao Tie,Zenghui Yuan,Zeli Zhao,Chaoran Hu,Tianhe Gu,Ruihang Zhang,Sizhe Zhang,Junran Wu,Xiaoyue Tu,Ming Jin,Qingsong Wen,Lixing Chen,Pan Zhou,Lichao Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CorrectBench是一个评估大语言模型自我纠正能力的基准测试，涵盖常识推理、数学推理和代码生成任务，发现自我纠正能提升准确性但效率较低，简单的思维链基线表现具有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前各种自我纠正方法被提出，但缺乏全面评估，需要验证LLM是否真正能够自我纠正。

Method: 开发CorrectBench基准，评估内在、外部和微调三种自我纠正策略在三种推理任务上的表现。

Result: 1) 自我纠正能提高准确性，特别是复杂推理任务；2) 混合策略能进一步提升但降低效率；3) 推理LLM在额外自我纠正下优化有限且时间成本高；4) 简单思维链基线在准确性和效率上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 自我纠正有潜力提升LLM推理性能，但需在推理能力和操作效率间寻求平衡，需要进一步研究优化。

Abstract: Self-correction of large language models (LLMs) emerges as a critical
component for enhancing their reasoning performance. Although various
self-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these
methods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly
correct themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this
study, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the
effectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and
fine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical
reasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction
methods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing
different self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it
reduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited
optimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs.
Interestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline
demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the
potential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while
highlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency. Consequently,
we advocate for further research focused on optimizing the balance between
reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Project Page:

### [4] [EvolveR: Self-Evolving LLM Agents through an Experience-Driven Lifecycle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16079)
*Rong Wu,Xiaoman Wang,Jianbiao Mei,Pinlong Cai,Daocheng Fu,Cheng Yang,Licheng Wen,Xuemeng Yang,Yufan Shen,Yuxin Wang,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvolveR是一个让LLM代理通过完整闭环体验生命周期实现自我改进的框架，包含离线自蒸馏和在线交互两个关键阶段，在复杂多跳问答基准测试中表现优于现有代理基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在工具使用方面表现出色，但缺乏从自身经验中系统学习的能力。现有框架主要关注弥补外部知识差距，未能解决更根本的限制：无法迭代优化问题解决策略。

Method: EvolveR框架包含两个关键阶段：(1)离线自蒸馏：将代理的交互轨迹合成为结构化、可重用的抽象策略原则库；(2)在线交互：代理与任务交互并主动检索蒸馏后的原则来指导决策，积累多样化行为轨迹。采用策略强化机制迭代更新代理。

Result: 在复杂多跳问答基准测试中，EvolveR实现了优于强大代理基线的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该工作为不仅从外部数据学习，还能从自身行为后果中学习的代理提供了全面蓝图，为更自主和持续改进的系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents show strong performance in tool
use, but lack the crucial capability to systematically learn from their own
experiences. While existing frameworks mainly focus on mitigating external
knowledge gaps, they fail to address a more fundamental limitation: the
inability to iteratively refine problem-solving strategies. In this work, we
introduce EvolveR, a framework designed to enable agent to self-improve through
a complete, closed-loop experience lifecycle. This lifecycle comprises two key
stages: (1) Offline Self-Distillation, where the agent's interaction
trajectories are synthesized into a structured repository of abstract, reusable
strategic principles; (2) Online Interaction, where the agent interacts with
tasks and actively retrieves distilled principles to guide its decision-making,
accumulating a diverse set of behavioral trajectories. This loop employs a
policy reinforcement mechanism to iteratively update the agent based on its
performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvolveR on complex multi-hop
question-answering benchmarks, where it achieves superior performance over
strong agentic baselines. Our work presents a comprehensive blueprint for
agents that learn not only from external data but also from the consequences of
their own actions, paving the way for more autonomous and continuously
improving systems. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/EvolveR.

### [5] [Evaluating Prompting Strategies and Large Language Models in Systematic Literature Review Screening: Relevance and Task-Stage Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16091)
*Binglan Han,Anuradha Mathrani,Teo Susnjak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究量化了提示策略与大型语言模型在系统文献综述筛选阶段的交互作用，发现CoT-few-shot提示在精确率-召回率平衡方面表现最佳，推荐使用低成本模型配合结构化提示进行初步筛选。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统文献综述的筛选阶段耗时耗力，需要探索如何利用大型语言模型自动化这一过程，并研究不同提示策略与模型之间的交互效果。

Method: 评估6个LLM在5种提示类型下的表现，包括零样本、少样本、思维链、思维链-少样本和自我反思，使用准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数等指标。

Result: CoT-few-shot提示提供最可靠的精确率-召回率平衡；零样本提示在高灵敏度筛选中召回率最高；自我反思表现不佳。GPT-4o和DeepSeek整体表现稳健，GPT-4o-mini在显著降低成本的同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 推荐采用分阶段工作流程：先用低成本模型配合结构化提示进行初步筛选，仅对边界案例使用高容量模型。LLM在文献筛选自动化方面具有不均衡但前景广阔的应用潜力。

Abstract: This study quantifies how prompting strategies interact with large language
models (LLMs) to automate the screening stage of systematic literature reviews
(SLRs). We evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat-V3,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Llama-4-Maverick) under five prompt types
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), CoT-few-shot, self-reflection)
across relevance classification and six Level-2 tasks, using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1. Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction
effects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance;
zero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection
underperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and
DeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs
competitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis
for relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute
differences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across
prompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer
attractive F1 at a small incremental cost. We recommend a staged workflow that
(1) deploys low-cost models with structured prompts for first-pass screening
and (2) escalates only borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These
findings highlight LLMs' uneven but promising potential to automate literature
screening. By systematically analyzing prompt-model interactions, we provide a
comparative benchmark and practical guidance for task-adaptive LLM deployment.

### [6] [Facts in Stats: Impacts of Pretraining Diversity on Language Model Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16096)
*Tina Behnia,Puneesh Deora,Christos Thrampoulidis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个合成测试平台，用于系统分析语言模型中统计规律与事实关联之间的交互对泛化能力的影响。研究发现上下文多样性和结构对事实回忆和泛化能力有复杂影响，并识别了不同的优化瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对语言模型中统计规律与事实关联交互影响的系统分析，特别是这些交互如何影响泛化能力。

Method: 设计了一个灵活的合成测试平台，将通用标记的统计流与抽象事实的源-目标标记对流相结合，能够精细控制它们的交互。通过控制实验和模型组件干预来分析影响。

Result: 研究发现更高的上下文多样性会延迟分布内事实准确性，但对分布外事实泛化的影响取决于上下文结构。在某些情况下，低多样性会阻碍事实回忆，而最优多样性水平取决于训练时长。

Conclusion: 上下文设计和多样性水平之间的相互作用以复杂方式影响不同的泛化方面，嵌入层和解嵌入层在分布外失败中起关键作用，合成框架为未来研究提供了受控测试平台。

Abstract: Language models are pretrained on sequences that blend statistical
regularities (making text fluent) with factual associations between specific
tokens (knowledge of facts). While recent work suggests that the variability of
their interaction, such as paraphrases of factual associations, critically
determines generalization ability, we lack a systematic analysis of these
impacts. This paper introduces a flexible synthetic testbed that combines a
statistical stream of generic tokens with an abstract factual stream of
source-target token pairs, enabling fine-grained control over their
interaction. The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by
manipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level
by varying which statistical streams each fact appears in. Through controlled
experiments, we find that while higher contextual diversity delays
in-distribution (ID) factual accuracy, its impact on out-of-distribution (OOD)
factual generalization depends critically on contextual structure. In some
cases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity
becomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity
prohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration.
Beyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical
generalization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade.
This shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level
impacts different generalization aspects. Further, through a series of
controlled interventions on the model components, we trace the OOD failures to
distinct optimization bottlenecks, highlighting the importance of the embedding
and unembedding layers. Our synthetic framework allows us to isolate effects
that would be confounded in large-scale studies, offering a controlled testbed
for future investigations.

### [7] [In Generative AI We (Dis)Trust? Computational Analysis of Trust and Distrust in Reddit Discussions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16173)
*Aria Pessianzadeh,Naima Sultana,Hildegarde Van den Bulck,David Gefen,Shahin Jabari,Rezvaneh Rezapour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首个关于生成式AI信任与不信任的计算研究，使用2022-2025年Reddit数据集分析公众态度，发现信任与不信任基本平衡，受技术性能和用户体验影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI融入日常生活，理解公众信任对负责任采用和治理至关重要，但缺乏大规模、纵向的计算方法来衡量对GenAI和LLMs的信任。

Method: 使用多年度Reddit数据集（39个子版块，197,618个帖子），结合众包标注和分类模型进行大规模分析。

Result: 信任与不信任随时间基本平衡，在主要模型发布时出现波动；技术性能和可用性是主要维度，个人经验是最常见态度形成原因；不同用户群体（专家、伦理学家、普通用户）呈现不同模式。

Conclusion: 研究提供了大规模信任分析的方法框架，并揭示了公众对GenAI不断演变的认知，为负责任AI发展提供见解。

Abstract: The rise of generative AI (GenAI) has impacted many aspects of human life. As
these systems become embedded in everyday practices, understanding public trust
in them also becomes essential for responsible adoption and governance. Prior
work on trust in AI has largely drawn from psychology and human-computer
interaction, but there is a lack of computational, large-scale, and
longitudinal approaches to measuring trust and distrust in GenAI and large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents the first computational study of
Trust and Distrust in GenAI, using a multi-year Reddit dataset (2022--2025)
spanning 39 subreddits and 197,618 posts. Crowd-sourced annotations of a
representative sample were combined with classification models to scale
analysis. We find that Trust and Distrust are nearly balanced over time, with
shifts around major model releases. Technical performance and usability
dominate as dimensions, while personal experience is the most frequent reason
shaping attitudes. Distinct patterns also emerge across trustors (e.g.,
experts, ethicists, general users). Our results provide a methodological
framework for large-scale Trust analysis and insights into evolving public
perceptions of GenAI.

### [8] [EgMM-Corpus: A Multimodal Vision-Language Dataset for Egyptian Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16198)
*Mohamed Gamil,Abdelrahman Elsayed,Abdelrahman Lila,Ahmed Gad,Hesham Abdelgawad,Mohamed Aref,Ahmed Fares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出EgMM-Corpus数据集，包含3000多张埃及文化图像，涵盖313个概念，用于评估和训练视觉语言模型在埃及文化背景下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中东和非洲地区的多模态文化多样性数据集有限，需要专门针对埃及文化的资源来减少现有模型的文化偏见。

Method: 设计新的数据收集流程，收集涵盖地标、食物和民俗的313个概念的3000多张图像，并进行人工验证文化真实性和多模态一致性。

Result: CLIP模型在EgMM-Corpus上的零样本分类准确率：Top-1为21.2%，Top-5为36.4%，显示出明显的文化偏见。

Conclusion: EgMM-Corpus作为基准数据集对于开发具有文化意识的模型至关重要，现有大规模视觉语言模型存在显著的文化偏见。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in AI, multimodal culturally diverse datasets are
still limited, particularly for regions in the Middle East and Africa. In this
paper, we introduce EgMM-Corpus, a multimodal dataset dedicated to Egyptian
culture. By designing and running a new data collection pipeline, we collected
over 3,000 images, covering 313 concepts across landmarks, food, and folklore.
Each entry in the dataset is manually validated for cultural authenticity and
multimodal coherence. EgMM-Corpus aims to provide a reliable resource for
evaluating and training vision-language models in an Egyptian cultural context.
We further evaluate the zero-shot performance of Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training CLIP on EgMM-Corpus, on which it achieves 21.2% Top-1 accuracy and
36.4% Top-5 accuracy in classification. These results underscore the existing
cultural bias in large-scale vision-language models and demonstrate the
importance of EgMM-Corpus as a benchmark for developing culturally aware
models.

### [9] [What Can String Probability Tell Us About Grammaticality?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16227)
*Jennifer Hu,Ethan Gotlieb Wilcox,Siyuan Song,Kyle Mahowald,Roger P. Levy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过理论分析和实证验证，探讨了语言模型对语法的学习程度，提出了基于最小语义差异句子对的评估框架，揭示了概率与语法性之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型是否真正学习了语法知识，因为概率和语法性在语言学中是不同概念，需要明确字符串概率能揭示多少LM的底层语法知识。

Method: 基于语料库生成过程的理论分析框架，使用28万句英语和中文句子对进行实证验证，包括最小语义差异句子对的概率相关性分析。

Result: 验证了三个预测：(1)最小语义差异句子对内的概率相关性；(2)模型与人类在最小对中delta值的相关性；(3)语法与不语法字符串在概率空间中分离度差。

Conclusion: 为使用概率研究LM结构知识提供了理论基础，并为未来LM语法评估指明了方向。

Abstract: What have language models (LMs) learned about grammar? This question remains
hotly debated, with major ramifications for linguistic theory. However, since
probability and grammaticality are distinct notions in linguistics, it is not
obvious what string probabilities can reveal about an LM's underlying
grammatical knowledge. We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship
between grammar, meaning, and string probability, based on simple assumptions
about the generative process of corpus data. Our framework makes three
predictions, which we validate empirically using 280K sentence pairs in English
and Chinese: (1) correlation between the probability of strings within minimal
pairs, i.e., string pairs with minimal semantic differences; (2) correlation
between models' and humans' deltas within minimal pairs; and (3) poor
separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical
strings. Our analyses give theoretical grounding for using probability to learn
about LMs' structural knowledge, and suggest directions for future work in LM
grammatical evaluation.

### [10] [Towards Low-Resource Alignment to Diverse Perspectives with Sparse Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16257)
*Chu Fei Luo,Samuel Dahan,Xiaodan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出两种方法（多元化解码和模型引导）来增强语言模型的多元对齐能力，在低资源设置下仅用50个标注样本就能超越零样本和少样本基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型的训练范式通常假设每个查询只有一个最优答案，导致响应过于通用且对齐效果差。需要确保模型能够反映人类价值观的多样性和细微差别。

Method: 使用多元化解码和模型引导两种方法，在低资源设置下仅需50个标注样本进行训练。

Result: 模型引导方法在多个高风险任务（如仇恨言论检测和错误信息检测）中减少假阳性，在GlobalOpinionQA中提高了与人类价值观的分布对齐度。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了多样性的重要性，展示了语言模型如何适应考虑细微视角，为增强模型多元对齐提供了有效方法。

Abstract: As language models have a greater impact on society, it is important to
ensure they are aligned to a diverse range of perspectives and are able to
reflect nuance in human values. However, the most popular training paradigms
for modern language models often assume there is one optimal answer for every
query, leading to generic responses and poor alignment. In this work, we aim to
enhance pluralistic alignment of language models in a low-resource setting with
two methods: pluralistic decoding and model steering. We empirically
demonstrate that model steering offers consistent improvement over zero-shot
and few-shot baselines with only 50 annotated samples. Our proposed methods
decrease false positives in several high-stakes tasks such as hate speech
detection and misinformation detection, and improves the distributional
alignment to human values in GlobalOpinionQA. We hope our work highlights the
importance of diversity and how language models can be adapted to consider
nuanced perspectives.

*Zhaoxuan Tan,Zixuan Zhang,Haoyang Wen,Zheng Li,Rongzhi Zhang,Pei Chen,Fengran Mo,Zheyuan Liu,Qingkai Zeng,Qingyu Yin,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Profile-to-PEFT框架使用超网络将用户配置文件直接映射到适配器参数，消除了部署时的逐用户训练，实现了即时适应、泛化到未见用户和隐私保护的本地部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法如"每个用户一个PEFT"需要为每个用户训练单独的适配器，计算成本高且不适用于实时更新。

Method: 引入Profile-to-PEFT框架，采用端到端训练的超网络，将编码后的用户配置文件直接映射到完整的适配器参数集（如LoRA）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在部署时使用显著更少的计算资源，同时优于基于提示的个性化和OPPU方法，对分布外用户具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Profile-to-PEFT框架实现了高效、可扩展和自适应的LLM个性化，适用于大规模应用。

Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) tailor content to individual
preferences using user profiles or histories. However, existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as the
``One-PEFT-Per-User'' (OPPU) paradigm, require training a separate adapter for
each user, making them computationally expensive and impractical for real-time
updates. We introduce Profile-to-PEFT, a scalable framework that employs a
hypernetwork, trained end-to-end, to map a user's encoded profile directly to a
full set of adapter parameters (e.g., LoRA), eliminating per-user training at
deployment. This design enables instant adaptation, generalization to unseen
users, and privacy-preserving local deployment. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms both prompt-based personalization and
OPPU while using substantially fewer computational resources at deployment. The
framework exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution users and
maintains robustness across varying user activity levels and different
embedding backbones. The proposed Profile-to-PEFT framework enables efficient,
scalable, and adaptive LLM personalization suitable for large-scale
applications.

*Pratham Singla,Shivank Garg,Ayush Singh,Ishan Garg,Ketan Suhaas Saichandran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM在训练后是否意识到自己的学习和思考过程，定义了三个核心能力：对学习策略的认知、策略跨领域泛化能力、以及推理过程与最终输出的对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着后训练技术的发展，LLM能够通过生成规划令牌来处理复杂逻辑任务，这引发了一个基本问题：模型是否意识到自己的学习和思考过程？

Method: 在多个需要学习不同策略的任务上实证评估三种核心能力，并对比SFT、DPO和GRPO三种后训练方法的模型表现。

Result: RL训练的模型比SFT模型表现出更强的学习行为认知能力和结构相似新任务的泛化能力，但推理过程与最终输出的对齐度较弱，GRPO训练的模型这一效应最明显。

Conclusion: RL训练方法能增强模型对学习策略的认知和泛化能力，但可能导致推理过程与输出之间的对齐问题，这为理解模型内部机制提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in post-training techniques have endowed Large Language
Models (LLMs) with enhanced capabilities for tackling complex, logic-intensive
tasks through the generation of supplementary planning tokens. This development
raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they "learn" and
"think"? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of
learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains,
and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We
empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require
learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models
post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization
(DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate
that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned
behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks
than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning
traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models.

### [13] [Utilising Large Language Models for Generating Effective Counter Arguments to Anti-Vaccine Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16359)
*Utsav Dhanuka,Soham Poddar,Saptarshi Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索使用LLMs生成针对疫苗错误信息的反驳论点，通过多种提示策略和微调方法优化反驳生成，并训练分类器对反疫苗推文进行多标签分类以实现情境感知的反驳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在社交媒体影响公共卫生的时代，打击疫苗怀疑论和错误信息成为关键社会目标。虽然错误信息检测取得进展，但生成实时、针对性的反驳论点仍是一个研究不足的领域。

Method: 基于先前错误信息反驳研究，实验多种提示策略和微调方法优化反驳生成，训练分类器将反疫苗推文分类为疫苗效力、副作用、政治影响等多标签类别，实现情境感知反驳。

Result: 通过人工判断、LLM评估和自动指标的评估显示这些方法具有强一致性。整合标签描述和结构化微调能增强反驳论点的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了整合标签描述和结构化微调的方法在规模化缓解疫苗错误信息方面具有前景。

Abstract: In an era where public health is increasingly influenced by information
shared on social media, combatting vaccine skepticism and misinformation has
become a critical societal goal. Misleading narratives around vaccination have
spread widely, creating barriers to achieving high immunisation rates and
undermining trust in health recommendations. While efforts to detect
misinformation have made significant progress, the generation of real time
counter-arguments tailored to debunk such claims remains an insufficiently
explored area. In this work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to generate
sound counter-argument rebuttals to vaccine misinformation. Building on prior
research in misinformation debunking, we experiment with various prompting
strategies and fine-tuning approaches to optimise counter-argument generation.
Additionally, we train classifiers to categorise anti-vaccine tweets into
multi-labeled categories such as concerns about vaccine efficacy, side effects,

evaluation, conducted through human judgment, LLM based assessments, and
automatic metrics, reveals strong alignment across these methods. Our findings
demonstrate that integrating label descriptions and structured fine-tuning
enhances counter-argument effectiveness, offering a promising approach for
mitigating vaccine misinformation at scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AASP框架，使用自回归结构预测方法联合建模论证组件和论证关系，在三个标准AM基准测试中取得了SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于论证挖掘任务中论证组件和论证关系之间的复杂依赖关系，现有方法通常通过生成式范式扁平化处理论证结构，这限制了性能。

Method: 提出AASP框架，将论证结构建模为预定义约束动作集，使用条件预训练语言模型以自回归方式逐步构建论证结构。

Result: 在三个标准AM基准测试中，AASP在两个基准上实现了SOTA结果，在一个基准上表现强劲。

Conclusion: AASP框架通过自回归结构预测有效捕捉论证推理流程，为论证挖掘任务提供了有效的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM) helps in automating the extraction of complex
argumentative structures such as Argument Components (ACs) like Premise, Claim
etc. and Argumentative Relations (ARs) like Support, Attack etc. in an
argumentative text. Due to the inherent complexity of reasoning involved with
this task, modelling dependencies between ACs and ARs is challenging. Most of
the recent approaches formulate this task through a generative paradigm by
flattening the argumentative structures. In contrast to that, this study
jointly formulates the key tasks of AM in an end-to-end fashion using
Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. The
proposed AASP framework is based on the autoregressive structure prediction
framework that has given good performance for several NLP tasks. AASP framework
models the argumentative structures as constrained pre-defined sets of actions
with the help of a conditional pre-trained language model. These actions build
the argumentative structures step-by-step in an autoregressive manner to
capture the flow of argumentative reasoning in an efficient way. Extensive
experiments conducted on three standard AM benchmarks demonstrate that AASP
achieves state-of-theart (SoTA) results across all AM tasks in two benchmarks
and delivers strong results in one benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级方法，通过线性变换特定层激活来提升LLM在心理健康评估中的表现，无需计算密集型技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs快速发展，但小规模模型在特定领域应用中仍表现不佳，特别是在心理健康这样的敏感高影响领域。

Method: 采用轻量级方法，对特定层激活应用线性变换，利用引导向量来指导模型输出。

Result: 该方法在两个不同任务中均取得改进：识别Reddit帖子是否有助于检测抑郁症状的相关性预测任务，以及基于用户Reddit历史完成标准化抑郁筛查问卷的任务。

Conclusion: 引导机制作为计算效率高的工具，在LLMs心理健康领域适应方面具有未开发的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming AI,
opening new opportunities in sensitive and high-impact areas such as Mental
Health (MH). Yet, despite these advancements, recent evidence reveals that
smaller-scale models still struggle to deliver optimal performance in
domain-specific applications. In this study, we present a cost-efficient yet
powerful approach to improve MH assessment capabilities of an LLM, without
relying on any computationally intensive techniques. Our lightweight method
consists of a linear transformation applied to a specific layer's activations,
leveraging steering vectors to guide the model's output. Remarkably, this
intervention enables the model to achieve improved results across two distinct
tasks: (1) identifying whether a Reddit post is useful for detecting the
presence or absence of depressive symptoms (relevance prediction task), and (2)
completing a standardized psychological screening questionnaire for depression
based on users' Reddit post history (questionnaire completion task). Results
highlight the untapped potential of steering mechanisms as computationally
efficient tools for LLMs' MH domain adaptation.

TL;DR: MoReBench是一个包含1000个道德场景和23000多个评估标准的基准，用于评估AI的道德推理过程，重点关注推理过程而非最终答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在决策中扮演越来越重要的角色，需要理解AI如何做出决策而不仅仅是决策结果。道德困境是评估推理过程的理想测试平台，因为允许多种合理的结论。

Method: 创建MoReBench基准，包含道德场景和专家制定的评估标准，涵盖识别道德考量、权衡利弊、给出可行建议等方面。另外创建MoReBench-Theory测试AI在五种主要规范伦理学框架下的推理能力。

Result: 研究发现扩展定律和现有的数学、代码、科学推理基准无法预测模型的道德推理能力。模型显示出对特定道德框架的偏好，这可能是流行训练范式的副作用。

Conclusion: 这些基准推进了以过程为重点的推理评估，有助于开发更安全、更透明的AI系统。

Abstract: As AI systems progress, we rely more on them to make decisions with us and
for us. To ensure that such decisions are aligned with human values, it is
imperative for us to understand not only what decisions they make but also how
they come to those decisions. Reasoning language models, which provide both
final responses and (partially transparent) intermediate thinking traces,
present a timely opportunity to study AI procedural reasoning. Unlike math and
code problems which often have objectively correct answers, moral dilemmas are
an excellent testbed for process-focused evaluation because they allow for
multiple defensible conclusions. To do so, we present MoReBench: 1,000 moral
scenarios, each paired with a set of rubric criteria that experts consider
essential to include (or avoid) when reasoning about the scenarios. MoReBench
contains over 23 thousand criteria including identifying moral considerations,
weighing trade-offs, and giving actionable recommendations to cover cases on AI
advising humans moral decisions as well as making moral decisions autonomously.
Separately, we curate MoReBench-Theory: 150 examples to test whether AI can
reason under five major frameworks in normative ethics. Our results show that
scaling laws and existing benchmarks on math, code, and scientific reasoning
tasks fail to predict models' abilities to perform moral reasoning. Models also
show partiality towards specific moral frameworks (e.g., Benthamite Act
Utilitarianism and Kantian Deontology), which might be side effects of popular
training paradigms. Together, these benchmarks advance process-focused
reasoning evaluation towards safer and more transparent AI.

TL;DR: 提出ATA方法，将LLM任务分解为离线知识摄取和在线任务处理两个阶段，通过符号化表示和推理引擎提高可信度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在高风险领域部署时的幻觉、不稳定性和缺乏透明度等可信度问题

Method: 神经符号方法，离线阶段将问题规范转化为形式化知识库，在线阶段使用符号决策引擎进行推理

Result: 在复杂推理任务中与最先进端到端模型竞争，使用人工验证知识库时显著优于更大模型，具有完美确定性、增强稳定性和抗提示注入攻击能力

Conclusion: ATA为构建透明、可审计、可靠的下一代自主代理提供了实用可控的架构

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains is hindered by inherent limitations in
trustworthiness, including hallucinations, instability, and a lack of
transparency. To address these challenges, we introduce a generic
neuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The
core of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline
knowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an
LLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic
knowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and
refined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain
requirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is
encoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes
this encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a
reliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task,
we demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with
state-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while
maintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected
knowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models,
while exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input
perturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks. By generating
decisions grounded in symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a practical and
controllable architecture for building the next generation of transparent,
auditable, and reliable autonomous agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挖掘Whisper模型在第二语言口语评估中的潜在能力，不同于以往仅分析其转录文本的研究，而是深入探索其隐藏表示中的特征。

Method: 从Whisper的中间和最终输出中提取声学和语言特征，仅训练轻量级分类器，并融入图像和文本提示信息作为辅助相关线索。

Result: 在GEPT图片描述数据集上表现出色，超越了包括多模态方法在内的现有先进基线，通过融入额外信息获得进一步性能提升。

Conclusion: 即使没有任务特定的微调，Whisper模型本质上能够编码口语的等级熟练度模式和语义方面，显示出其作为口语评估和理解的强大基础模型的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a
well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the
context of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that
extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a
step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and
linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight
classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs,
our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset,
outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach.
Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary
relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even
without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal
proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential
as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FrugalPrompt是一个用于大语言模型的提示压缩框架，通过保留最具语义重要性的token来减少输入长度，从而降低成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的输入上下文通常包含大量冗余的低效用token，这些token增加了成本、碳足迹和推理延迟。

Method: 使用GlobEnc和DecompX两种token归因方法为输入序列中的每个token分配显著性分数，按原始顺序保留前k%的token来获得稀疏的压缩提示。

Result: 在情感分析、常识问答和摘要任务中，20%的提示压缩仅导致任务性能的轻微损失，但在数学推理任务中性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于更细致地理解LLM在性能-效率权衡中的行为，并界定了对上下文稀疏性容忍的任务与需要完整上下文的任务之间的边界。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) owe much of their stellar performance to
expansive input contexts, yet such verbosity inflates monetary costs, carbon
footprint, and inference-time latency. Much of this overhead manifests from the
redundant low-utility tokens present in typical prompts, as only a fraction of
tokens typically carries the majority of the semantic weight. We address this
inefficiency by introducing FrugalPrompt, a novel prompt compression framework
for LLMs, which retains only the most semantically significant tokens.
Leveraging two state-of-the-art token attribution methods, GlobEnc and DecompX,
we assign salience scores to every token in an input sequence, rank them to
preserve the top-k% tokens in their original order, and obtain a sparse
frugalized prompt. We evaluate the approach across four NLP tasks: Sentiment
Analysis, Commonsense QA, Summarization, and Mathematical Reasoning, using a
suite of frontier LLMs. For the first three tasks, a 20% prompt reduction
incurs only a marginal loss in task performance, demonstrating that
contemporary LLMs can reconstruct elided context from high-salience cues. In
contrast, performance on mathematical reasoning deteriorates sharply,
reflecting a stronger dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis
with bottom-k% and random-k% tokens reveals asymmetric performance patterns
that may suggest potential task contamination effects, wherein models may
resort to shallow memorized patterns from pretraining exposure for conventional
NLP tasks. We posit that our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding
of LLM behavior in performance-efficiency trade-offs, and delineate the
boundary between tasks tolerant to contextual sparsity and those requiring
exhaustive context. Our source code and models are available at:

TL;DR: TrajSelector是一个高效的Best-of-N框架，利用LLM的隐藏状态进行过程级评分，通过轻量级验证器评估推理轨迹质量，在保持较低推理成本的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的外部TTS方法存在计算开销大和未充分利用LLM内在潜表示的问题，需要更高效的轨迹选择方法。

Method: 使用轻量级验证器（0.6B参数）评估步骤级轨迹质量，聚合得分选择最优推理轨迹，采用端到端训练方法无需大量步骤级标注。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，TrajSelector在Best-of-32设置下比多数投票准确率高4.61%，比现有过程奖励模型高4.31%-12.21%，且推理成本更低。

Conclusion: TrajSelector通过利用LLM隐藏状态进行过程级评分，实现了高效且有效的推理轨迹选择，显著提升了性能同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in complex
reasoning tasks, largely enabled by test-time scaling (TTS) paradigms that
allocate additional compute during inference. Among these, external TTS
(particularly the Best-of-N selection paradigm) yields scalable performance
improvements by selecting from multiple independently generated reasoning
trajectories. However, this approach faces key limitations: (i) the high
computational overhead of deploying process reward models, (ii) the
underutilization of the LLM's intrinsic latent representations. We introduce
TrajSelector, an efficient and effective Best-of-N framework that exploit the
hidden states in the sampler LLM for process-level scoring. A lightweight
verifier (with only 0.6B parameters) evaluates the quality of step-wise
trajectory, and then aggregates these scores to identify the optimal reasoning
trajectory. Our framework employs a fully data-driven, end-to-end training
recipe that eliminates reliance on massive step-level annotations. Experiential
results across five benchmarks demonstrate that TrajSelector delivers
consistent performance gains. In Best-of-32 settings, it surpasses majority
voting by 4.61% accuracy and outperforms existing process reward models by
4.31% to 12.21%, all while maintaining lower inference costs.

Conclusion: RAVEN框架有效提升了广告视频违规检测的性能，具有良好的泛化能力，并成功部署到在线广告服务中。

Abstract: Advertisement (Ad) video violation detection is critical for ensuring
platform compliance, but existing methods struggle with precise temporal
grounding, noisy annotations, and limited generalization. We propose RAVEN, a
novel framework that integrates curriculum reinforcement learning with
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance reasoning and cognitive
capabilities for violation detection. RAVEN employs a progressive training
strategy, combining precisely and coarsely annotated data, and leverages Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to develop emergent reasoning abilities
without explicit reasoning annotations. Multiple hierarchical sophisticated
reward mechanism ensures precise temporal grounding and consistent category
prediction. Experiments on industrial datasets and public benchmarks show that
RAVEN achieves superior performances in violation category accuracy and
temporal interval localization. We also design a pipeline to deploy the RAVEN
on the online Ad services, and online A/B testing further validates its
practical applicability, with significant improvements in precision and recall.
RAVEN also demonstrates strong generalization, mitigating the catastrophic
forgetting issue associated with supervised fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本研究扩展了自然语言推理(NLI)中人类标注变异的分析范围，不仅关注标注者在推理类型上的差异，还考察了标注步骤中的分歧。通过LiTEx分类法分析两个英文NLI数据集，发现表面标签分歧可能掩盖了深层的解释一致性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注标注者标签一致但解释不同的情况，而本研究希望更全面地分析标注变异，包括标注者在推理类型和标注步骤中的分歧，以更深入理解NLI标注的复杂性。

Method: 使用LiTEx分类法分析两个英文NLI数据集，从NLI标签一致性、解释相似性和分类法一致性等多个维度对齐标注变异，并考虑标注者选择偏见的复合因素。

Result: 发现标注者标签不一致但解释高度相似的情况，表明表面分歧可能掩盖了深层的解释一致性。分析还揭示了标注者在解释策略和标签选择上的个体偏好。

Conclusion: 推理类型的一致性比单纯的标签一致性更能反映自由文本解释的语义相似性。研究强调了基于推理的解释的丰富性，以及将标签视为绝对真实时需要谨慎的必要性。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference datasets often exhibit human label variation. To
better understand these variations, explanation-based approaches analyze the
underlying reasoning behind annotators' decisions. One such approach is the
LiTEx taxonomy, which categorizes free-text explanations in English into
reasoning types. However, previous work applying such taxonomies has focused on
within-label variation: cases where annotators agree on the final NLI label but
provide different explanations. In contrast, this paper broadens the scope by
examining how annotators may diverge not only in the reasoning type but also in
the labeling step. We use explanations as a lens to decompose the reasoning
process underlying NLI annotation and to analyze individual differences. We
apply LiTEx to two NLI English datasets and align annotation variation from
multiple aspects: NLI label agreement, explanation similarity, and taxonomy
agreement, with an additional compounding factor of annotators' selection bias.
We observe instances where annotators disagree on the label but provide highly
similar explanations, suggesting that surface-level disagreement may mask
underlying agreement in interpretation. Moreover, our analysis reveals
individual preferences in explanation strategies and label choices. These
findings highlight that agreement in reasoning types better reflects the
semantic similarity of free-text explanations than label agreement alone. Our
findings underscore the richness of reasoning-based explanations and the need
for caution in treating labels as ground truth.

TL;DR: 提出在LLM智能体中引入"退出"机制作为安全防护措施，当智能体缺乏信心时主动退出，在12个先进LLM上验证了该机制能显著提升安全性而几乎不影响帮助性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在复杂环境中运行并产生现实后果，其安全性变得至关重要。多轮交互场景中的不确定性和模糊性会累积，导致超出传统文本生成失败的严重风险。

Method: 利用ToolEmu框架，在12个最先进的LLM上系统评估退出行为，通过添加明确的退出指令来让智能体在缺乏信心时主动退出。

Result: 结果显示退出机制带来了极佳的安全-帮助性权衡：所有模型的安全性平均提升+0.39（0-3分制），专有模型提升+0.64，而帮助性仅平均下降-0.03。

Conclusion: 简单的退出指令是一种高效的安全机制，可立即部署到现有智能体系统中，作为高风险应用中自主智能体的有效一线防御机制。

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly operate in complex
environments with real-world consequences, their safety becomes critical. While
uncertainty quantification is well-studied for single-turn tasks, multi-turn
agentic scenarios with real-world tool access present unique challenges where
uncertainties and ambiguities compound, leading to severe or catastrophic risks
beyond traditional text generation failures. We propose using "quitting" as a
simple yet effective behavioral mechanism for LLM agents to recognize and
withdraw from situations where they lack confidence. Leveraging the ToolEmu
framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of quitting behavior across 12
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate a highly favorable
safety-helpfulness trade-off: agents prompted to quit with explicit
instructions improve safety by an average of +0.39 on a 0-3 scale across all
models (+0.64 for proprietary models), while maintaining a negligible average
decrease of -0.03 in helpfulness. Our analysis demonstrates that simply adding
explicit quit instructions proves to be a highly effective safety mechanism
that can immediately be deployed in existing agent systems, and establishes
quitting as an effective first-line defense mechanism for autonomous agents in
high-stakes applications.

Conclusion: 该方法在多样化领域和预算约束下展现出强大的适应性，显著提高了智能体系统的性能和成本效益

Abstract: Designing effective agentic systems requires the seamless composition and
integration of agents, tools, and models within dynamic and uncertain
environments. Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval
approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and
composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete
capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component
selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and
real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured,
automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the
knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically
identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly
considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically
testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our
approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable
reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five
benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer
consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at
significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the
single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate
improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In
multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from
37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The
substantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method
across diverse domains and budget constraints.

Result: 构建了包含6,634篇论文、24,657个真实评审和46,438个合成评审的语料库。有缺陷评审显示较低评分、较高自信度、结构复杂度降低和负面情绪比例更高。混合训练显著提高了二元任务的召回率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 这是首个用于检测有缺陷同行评审的LLM驱动系统，为同行评审中的AI治理提供证据，并为维护学术诚信的人机协作提供宝贵见解。

Abstract: Peer review serves as the gatekeeper of science, yet the surge in submissions
and widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scholarly evaluation
present unprecedented challenges. Recent work has focused on using LLMs to
improve review efficiency or generate insightful review content. However,
unchecked deficient reviews from both human experts and AI systems threaten to
systematically undermine the peer review ecosystem and compromise academic
integrity. To address this critical issue, we introduce ReviewGuard, an
automated system for detecting and categorizing deficient reviews. ReviewGuard
employs a comprehensive four-stage LLM-driven framework that: (1) collects ICLR
and NeurIPS papers with their corresponding reviews from OpenReview; (2)
annotates review types using GPT-4.1 with human validation; (3) addresses class
imbalance and data scarcity through LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation,
producing a final corpus of 6,634 papers, 24,657 real reviews, and 46,438
synthetic reviews; and (4) fine-tunes both encoder-based models and open source
LLMs. We perform comprehensive feature analysis of the structure and quality of
the review text. Compared to sufficient reviews, deficient reviews demonstrate
lower rating scores, higher self-reported confidence, reduced structural
complexity, and a higher proportion of negative sentiment. AI-generated text
detection reveals that, since ChatGPT's emergence, AI-generated reviews have
increased dramatically. In the evaluation of deficient review detection models,
mixed training with synthetic and real review data provides substantial
enhancements to recall and F1 scores on the binary task. This study presents
the first LLM-driven system for detecting deficient peer reviews, providing
evidence to inform AI governance in peer review while offering valuable
insights into human-AI collaboration to maintain academic integrity.

TL;DR: 本文通过分析LLMs在不同文化和语言条件下的激活路径重叠，揭示了语言对内部文化理解机制的影响强于文化本身，并发现语言相似性不一定保证内部表征的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在多元文化背景下的广泛应用，准确的文化理解变得至关重要。现有评估多关注输出层面，难以揭示响应差异的驱动因素，而电路分析研究覆盖语言少且很少聚焦文化。

Method: 通过测量LLMs在两种条件下回答语义等价问题时的激活路径重叠：(1)固定问题语言、改变目标国家；(2)固定国家、改变问题语言。同时使用同语言国家对比来分离语言和文化因素。

Result: 结果显示，同语言跨国家问题的内部路径重叠度高于跨语言同国家问题，表明存在强烈的语言特定模式。特别是韩国-朝鲜对比显示出低重叠和高变异性，说明语言相似性不保证内部表征对齐。

Conclusion: LLMs的内部文化理解机制受语言影响强于文化因素，语言相似性不一定转化为内部表征的一致性，这对跨文化LLM应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural
contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations
have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that
drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have
covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace
LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path
overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions:
varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the
question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country
pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal
paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for
cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific
patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and
high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned
internal representation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SHALLOW是首个系统分类和量化ASR系统中幻觉现象的基准框架，包含词汇、语音、形态和语义四个维度，提供比传统WER更细粒度的错误分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统产生的幻觉（与语音输入无关但语法语义合理的转录）在关键领域存在严重风险，而传统评估指标无法有效区分语音错误和幻觉。

Method: 提出SHALLOW框架，从词汇、语音、形态和语义四个互补维度系统分类幻觉现象，并为每个类别定义针对性指标。

Result: SHALLOW指标在高识别质量时与WER强相关，但在WER增加时相关性显著减弱，能够捕捉WER无法区分的细粒度错误模式。

Conclusion: SHALLOW框架支持特定模型弱点的诊断，并提供超越聚合错误率的模型改进反馈，有助于更全面地评估ASR系统的幻觉倾向。

Abstract: Hallucinations in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems refer to fluent
and coherent transcriptions produced by neural ASR models that are completely
unrelated to the underlying acoustic input (i.e., the speech signal). While
similar to conventional decoding errors in potentially compromising the
usability of transcriptions for downstream applications, hallucinations can be
more detrimental due to their preservation of syntactically and semantically
plausible structure. This apparent coherence can mislead subsequent processing
stages and introduce serious risks, particularly in critical domains such as
healthcare and law. Conventional evaluation metrics are primarily centered on
error-based metrics and fail to distinguish between phonetic inaccuracies and
hallucinations. Consequently, there is a critical need for new evaluation
frameworks that can effectively identify and assess models with a heightened
propensity for generating hallucinated content. To this end, we introduce
SHALLOW, the first benchmark framework that systematically categorizes and
quantifies hallucination phenomena in ASR along four complementary axes:
lexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic. We define targeted metrics
within each category to produce interpretable profiles of model behavior.
Through evaluation across various architectures and speech domains, we have
found that SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate (WER) when
recognition quality is high (i.e., low WER). Still, this correlation weakens
substantially as WER increases. SHALLOW, therefore, captures fine-grained error
patterns that WER fails to distinguish under degraded and challenging
conditions. Our framework supports specific diagnosis of model weaknesses and
provides feedback for model improvement beyond what aggregate error rates can
offer.

*Muhammad Ammar,Hadiya Murad Hadi,Usman Majeed Butt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对乌尔都语的AI生成文本检测框架，使用多语言transformer模型在平衡数据集上训练，mDeBERTa-v3-base模型在测试集上达到91.29%的F1分数和91.26%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM生成文本能力的增强，区分人类和机器生成的文本变得困难，特别是在乌尔都语等低资源语言中缺乏检测工具，这可能导致错误信息和学术不端问题。

Method: 构建包含1800篇人类撰写和1800篇AI生成文本的平衡数据集，进行语言学和统计分析，并微调三种多语言transformer模型（mdeberta-v3-base、distilbert-base-multilingualcased、xlm-roberta-base）。

Result: mDeBERTa-v3-base模型表现最佳，在测试集上获得91.29%的F1分数和91.26%的准确率，有效检测乌尔都语AI生成文本。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了在乌尔都语社区对抗错误信息和学术不端的努力，并为低资源语言的NLP工具开发做出了贡献。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now capable of generating text that closely
resembles human writing, making them powerful tools for content creation, but
this growing ability has also made it harder to tell whether a piece of text
was written by a human or by a machine. This challenge becomes even more
serious for languages like Urdu, where there are very few tools available to
detect AI-generated text. To address this gap, we propose a novel AI-generated
text detection framework tailored for the Urdu language. A balanced dataset
comprising 1,800 humans authored, and 1,800 AI generated texts, sourced from
models such as Gemini, GPT-4o-mini, and Kimi AI was developed. Detailed
linguistic and statistical analysis was conducted, focusing on features such as
character and word counts, vocabulary richness (Type Token Ratio), and N-gram
patterns, with significance evaluated through t-tests and MannWhitney U tests.
Three state-of-the-art multilingual transformer models such as
mdeberta-v3-base, distilbert-base-multilingualcased, and xlm-roberta-base were
fine-tuned on this dataset. The mDeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest
performance, with an F1-score 91.29 and accuracy of 91.26% on the test set.
This research advances efforts in contesting misinformation and academic
misconduct in Urdu-speaking communities and contributes to the broader
development of NLP tools for low resource languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DiMo多智能体协作框架，通过模拟四个专门LLM智能体之间的结构化辩论来增强性能和可解释性，每个智能体代表不同的推理范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能强大但缺乏可解释的推理过程，需要一种能够提供明确、可审计推理链的方法。

Method: 使用四个专门LLM智能体，每个代表不同的推理范式，通过迭代辩论来挑战和优化初始响应，生成更鲁棒的结论。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，DiMo在统一开源设置下比单模型和辩论基线提高了准确性，在数学问题上提升最大。

Conclusion: DiMo是一个语义感知的Web原生多智能体框架，能够生成语义类型化、URL注释的证据链，便于解释和用户友好交互。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance but often lack
interpretable reasoning. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration
Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo), which enhances both performance
and interpretability by simulating a structured debate among four specialized
LLM agents. Each agent embodies a distinct reasoning paradigm, allowing the
framework to collaboratively explore diverse cognitive approaches. Through
iterative debate, agents challenge and refine initial responses, yielding more
robust conclusions and an explicit, auditable reasoning chain. Across six
benchmarks and under a unified open-source setup, DiMo improves accuracy over
widely used single-model and debate baselines, with the largest gains on math.
We position DiMo as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework: it
models human-machine intelligence with LLM agents that produce semantically
typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly
interactions. Although our experiments use standard reasoning benchmarks, the
framework is designed to be instantiated over Web corpora and knowledge graphs,
combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications that
downstream systems can inspect and reuse.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT)方法，通过将实例感知信息融入提示学习，解决了传统提示学习方法缺乏实例感知信息的问题，实现了参数高效且性能优越的模型调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于提示的学习方法存在两个主要问题：1) 严重依赖人工网格搜索寻找最优提示长度，计算负担大；2) 缺乏实例感知信息，导致与输入序列的注意力交互受限。研究发现简单加入实例感知信息即可提升模型性能。

Method: 提出Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT)方法，创新性地将实例感知信息和任务感知信息集成到单个胶囊提示中，采用近乎参数免费的方式，利用现成的信息性实例语义进行提示学习。

Result: 在多个语言任务上表现出优越性能（如T5-Large上平均准确率达84.03%），同时保持高参数效率（如Llama3.2-1B上仅需模型参数的0.003%）。

Conclusion: CaPT方法通过引入'注意力锚点'机制，能够有效保留对关键结构信息的强注意力，并与所有输入标记展示更活跃的注意力交互，为提示学习提供了一种高效有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt-based learning has emerged as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT)
approach to facilitate Large Language Model (LLM) adaptation to downstream
tasks by conditioning generation with task-aware guidance. Despite its
successes, current prompt-based learning methods heavily rely on laborious grid
searching for optimal prompt length and typically require considerable number
of prompts, introducing additional computational burden. Worse yet, our pioneer
findings indicate that the task-aware prompt design is inherently limited by
its absence of instance-aware information, leading to a subtle attention
interplay with the input sequence. In contrast, simply incorporating
instance-aware information as a part of the guidance can enhance the
prompt-tuned model performance without additional fine-tuning. Moreover, we
find an interesting phenomenon, namely "attention anchor", that incorporating
instance-aware tokens at the earliest position of the sequence can successfully
preserve strong attention to critical structural information and exhibit more
active attention interaction with all input tokens. In light of our
observation, we introduce Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT), an efficient and
effective solution that leverages off-the-shelf, informative instance semantics
into prompt-based learning. Our approach innovatively integrates both
instance-aware and task-aware information in a nearly parameter-free manner
(i.e., one single capsule prompt). Empirical results demonstrate that our
method can exhibit superior performance across various language tasks (e.g.,
84.03\% average accuracy on T5-Large), serving as an "attention anchor," while
enjoying high parameter efficiency (e.g., 0.003\% of model parameters on
Llama3.2-1B).

### [32] [Temporal Understanding under Deictic Frame of Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16685)
*Damin Zhang,Julia Rayz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了TUuD框架来评估大语言模型在动态时间参考点下理解时间-事件和事件-事件关系的能力，发现LLMs表现出部分人类时间认知特征但对时间距离敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过空间隐喻理解时间，使用时间参考框架(t-FoR)来感知相对于"现在"的时间关系。虽然LLMs在自然语言理解方面取得显著进展，但其时间理解和推理能力仍然有限。

Method: 引入TUuD框架，让LLMs在时间线上动态移动的"现在"参考点下，评估当前时刻与目标事件之间的相似度（0.00-1.00），量化两个时间点之间的感知时间对齐程度。

Result: 四个评估的LLMs表现出对指示性t-FoR的可测量适应，相似度评分在现在附近达到峰值，并向过去和未来事件递减。但适应在超出近期语境时会减弱。

Conclusion: LLMs显示出部分人类时间认知特征，但其时间推理仍然对参考框架转换和时间距离敏感。

Abstract: Understanding time is fundamental to human cognition, where temporal
experience is often conceptualized through spatial metaphors grounded in
sensory-motor experience. For example, "summer is approaching" parallels "We
are approaching the summer". In such expressions, humans rely on a frame of
reference (FoR) to interpret meaning relative to a particular viewpoint.
Extending this concept to time, a temporal frame of reference (t-FoR) defines
how temporal relations are perceived relative to an experiencer's moment of
"now". While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in
natural language understanding, their ability to interpret and reason about
time remains limited. In this work, we introduce TUuD (Temporal Understanding
under Deictic t-FoR), a framework that evaluates how LLMs interpret time-event
and event-event relations when the reference point of "now" dynamically shifts
along a timeline. Following recent work on temporal cognition
\cite{li2025other}, LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the
current moment and a target event from 0.00 (completely dissimilar) to 1.00
(highly similar), where similarity quantifies perceived temporal alignment
between the two points. Our results show that four evaluated LLMs exhibit
measurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR, with similarity ratings peaking
around the present and decreasing toward past and future events. The
adaptation, however, weakens beyond near-term contexts, suggesting that while
LLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning
remains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了思维链（CoT）推理在自然语言理解（NLU）任务中的应用，发现随着模型规模增大，CoT推理从阻碍NLU性能转变为超越直接标签预测，且专门设计的基于理性的训练方法能显著提升模型在未见NLU任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注思维链在推理任务中的作用，而忽视了其在自然语言理解任务中的潜在影响。本文旨在探索理性是否同样能有益于NLU任务。

Method: 构建了NLURC数据集，开发了多种基于理性的增强方法，并系统性地探索了这些方法在NLU任务上的适用性。

Result: 发现模型规模与CoT推理效果呈正相关；大多数基于理性的训练方法表现不如仅使用标签的训练，但有一种专门设计的方法能持续改进性能；使用理性训练的LLM在未见NLU任务上表现显著提升，且可解释性可与商业LLM相媲美。

Conclusion: 理性在NLU任务中具有重要价值，特别是在模型规模较大时，能显著提升性能和在未见任务上的泛化能力，同时提供良好的可解释性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, which provide step-by-step reasoning to
derive final answers, benefit LLMs in both inference and training.
Incorporating rationales, either by generating them before answering during
inference, or by placing them before or after the original answers during
training - significantly improves model performance on mathematical, symbolic
and commonsense reasoning tasks. However, most work focuses on the role of
rationales in these reasoning tasks, overlooking their potential impact on
other important tasks like natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. In this
work, we raise the question: Can rationales similarly benefit NLU tasks? To
conduct a systematic exploration, we construct NLURC, a comprehensive and
high-quality NLU dataset collection with rationales, and develop various
rationale-augmented methods. Through exploring the applicability of these
methods on NLU tasks using the dataset, we uncover several potentially
surprising findings: (1) CoT inference shifts from hindering NLU performance to
surpassing direct label prediction as model size grows, indicating a positive
correlation. (2) Most rationale-augmented training methods perform worse than
label-only training, with one specially designed method consistently achieving
improvements. (3) LLMs trained with rationales achieve significant performance
gains on unseen NLU tasks, rivaling models ten times their size, while
delivering interpretability on par with commercial LLMs.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent in modern society
and has a significant effect on global health and well-being. Heart-related
conditions are intricate, multifaceted disorders, which may be influenced by a
combination of genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and various
socioeconomic and clinical factors. Information regarding these potentially
complex interrelationships is dispersed among diverse types of textual data,
which include patient narratives, medical records, and scientific literature,
among others. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have increasingly
been adopted as a powerful means to analyse and make sense of this vast amount
of unstructured data. This, in turn, can allow healthcare professionals to gain
deeper insights into the cardiology field, which has the potential to
revolutionize current approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of
cardiac problems. This review provides a detailed overview of NLP research in
cardiology between 2014 and 2025. We queried six literature databases to find
articles describing the application of NLP techniques in the context of a range
of different cardiovascular diseases. Following a rigorous screening process,
we identified a total of 265 relevant articles. We analysed each article from
multiple dimensions, i.e., NLP paradigm types, cardiology-related task types,
cardiovascular disease types, and data source types. Our analysis reveals
considerable diversity within each of these dimensions, thus demonstrating the
considerable breadth of NLP research within the field. We also perform a
temporal analysis, which illustrates the evolution and changing trends in NLP
methods employed over the last decade that we cover. To our knowledge, the
review constitutes the most comprehensive overview of NLP research in
cardiology to date.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在与搜索/检索引擎集成时存在严重的立场不稳定问题，即"变色龙行为"，当面对多轮对话中的矛盾问题时容易改变立场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成搜索/检索引擎的LLM系统存在关键漏洞，可能影响其可靠性，特别是在医疗、法律和金融等需要保持一致立场的领域。

Method: 创建了包含17,770个问答对的Chameleon基准数据集，涵盖12个争议领域的1,180个多轮对话，并引入变色龙分数和源重用率两个指标来量化立场不稳定性和知识多样性。

Result: 评估显示所有模型都表现出严重的变色龙行为（分数0.391-0.511），GPT-4o-mini表现最差。源重用率与置信度和立场变化之间存在显著相关性。

Conclusion: LLMs在部署到关键决策支持系统前需要进行全面的连贯性评估，因为有限的知识多样性使模型病态地顺从查询框架。

Abstract: Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become
ubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines
their reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of "chameleon
behavior" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with
contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in
search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising
17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn
conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in
state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the
Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use
Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of
Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent
failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511),
with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small
across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a
sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations
between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes
(r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that
limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query
framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency
evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems
where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for
reliable decision support.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了诗歌中空白空间的重要性，分析了19k首诗歌中空白空间的使用模式，比较了人类创作诗歌与LLM生成诗歌的差异，并探讨了文本处理方法对空白空间表示的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空白空间是诗歌形式的关键组成部分，反映了诗人对标准化形式的遵守和反叛。尽管诗歌是长期存在的艺术形式，也是LLM的生成任务，但NLP社区对空白空间的研究关注不足。

Method: 使用来自Poetry Foundation的19k首英语诗歌语料库，分析4k位诗人如何使用空白空间。比较了已发表诗歌与51k首LLM生成诗歌和12k首未发表在线社区诗歌的空白空间使用。

Result: 发现不同文本处理方法会导致诗歌数据中空白空间表示的显著差异。发布了2.8k首公共领域诗歌子集以促进进一步研究。

Conclusion: 研究结果对LLM预训练数据集的处理策略具有重要启示，强调了在诗歌分析中保留空白空间格式的重要性。

Abstract: Whitespace is a critical component of poetic form, reflecting both adherence
to standardized forms and rebellion against those forms. Each poem's whitespace
distribution reflects the artistic choices of the poet and is an integral
semantic and spatial feature of the poem. Yet, despite the popularity of poetry
as both a long-standing art form and as a generation task for large language
models (LLMs), whitespace has not received sufficient attention from the NLP
community. Using a corpus of 19k English-language published poems from Poetry
Foundation, we investigate how 4k poets have used whitespace in their works. We
release a subset of 2.8k public-domain poems with preserved formatting to
facilitate further research in this area. We compare whitespace usage in the
published poems to (1) 51k LLM-generated poems, and (2) 12k unpublished poems
posted in an online community. We also explore whitespace usage across time
periods, poetic forms, and data sources. Additionally, we find that different
text processing methods can result in significantly different representations
of whitespace in poetry data, motivating us to use these poems and whitespace
patterns to discuss implications for the processing strategies used to assemble
pretraining datasets for LLMs.

TL;DR: Beacon是一个单轮强制选择基准，用于测量大型语言模型在事实准确性和顺从偏见之间的权衡，揭示了模型容量增加会强化语言和情感子偏见，并提出了干预方法来调节这些偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在奖励优化过程中混淆了帮助性和礼貌服从，形成了在真实性和谄媚奉承之间的结构性权衡，这种潜在的偏见被称为谄媚性，表现为偏好用户同意而非原则性推理。

Method: 引入Beacon基准，通过单轮强制选择隔离这种偏见，独立于对话上下文，实现对事实准确性和顺从偏见之间张力的精确测量。评估了12个最先进模型，并提出了提示级和激活级干预方法。

Result: 评估显示谄媚性分解为稳定的语言和情感子偏见，每个都随模型容量扩展而增强。干预方法能够在相反方向上调节这些偏见，揭示了对齐的内部几何结构是真实性和社会合规判断之间的动态流形。

Conclusion: Beacon将谄媚性重新定义为可测量的规范性错误泛化形式，为研究和大规模生成系统中的对齐漂移缓解提供了可重复的基础。

Abstract: Large language models internalize a structural trade-off between truthfulness
and obsequious flattery, emerging from reward optimization that conflates
helpfulness with polite submission. This latent bias, known as sycophancy,
manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We
introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias
independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the
tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve
state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable
linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We
further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate
these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of
alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant
judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative
misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and
mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.

Motivation: 现有语言智能体在动态对抗游戏中因策略推理能力不足而表现不佳，需要无需专家标注数据的自动学习方法，且对手选择对学习效果影响显著但研究不足。

Method: 提出SCO-PAL方法，通过游戏交互自动学习，分析不同级别对手选择的影响，发现自我博弈是最有效的策略推理提升方式。

Result: 使用SCO-PAL结合自我博弈，在六个对抗性游戏中相比基线平均胜率提高约30%，对抗GPT-4达到54.76%的胜率。

Conclusion: 自我博弈是提升对抗性环境中策略推理的最有效方法，SCO-PAL方法显著提高了语言智能体的游戏表现。

Abstract: Existing language agents often encounter difficulties in dynamic adversarial
games due to poor strategic reasoning. To mitigate this limitation, a promising
approach is to allow agents to learn from game interactions automatically,
without relying on costly expert-labeled data. Unlike static environments where
agents receive fixed feedback or rewards, selecting appropriate opponents in
dynamic adversarial games can significantly impact learning performance.
However, the discussion of opponents in adversarial environments remains an
area under exploration. In this paper, we propose a Step-level poliCy
Optimization method through Play-And-Learn, SCO-PAL. Leveraging SCO-PAL, we
conduct a detailed analysis of opponent selection by setting opponents at
different levels and find that self-play is the most effective way to improve
strategic reasoning in such adversarial environments. Utilizing SCO-PAL with
self-play, we increase the average win rate against four opponents by
approximately 30% compared to baselines and achieve a 54.76% win rate against
GPT-4 in six adversarial games.

methods to effectively assess their performance in long-context understanding.
In this paper, we present \textbf{LC-Eval}, a bilingual, multi-task evaluation
benchmark designed to evaluate long-context understanding in English and
Arabic, targeting context lengths ranging from 4k to over 128k tokens. LC-Eval
introduces four novel and challenging tasks: multi-document question answering,
bilingual question answering, claim verification within a paragraph, and
multiple-choice questions based on long contexts. These tasks are designed to
assess LLMs' abilities in deep reasoning, document comprehension, information
tracing, and bilingual information extraction and understanding. The benchmark
includes datasets in both Arabic and English for each task, allowing for a
comparative analysis of their performance across different text genres.
Evaluations were conducted on both open-weight and closed LLMs, with results
indicating that LC-Eval presents significant challenges. Even high-performing
models, such as GPT-4o, struggled with certain tasks, highlighting the
complexity and rigor of the benchmark.

TL;DR: MOSAIC是一个多阶段领域自适应框架，通过联合优化掩码语言建模和对比学习目标，将通用句子嵌入模型适配到专业领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模通用领域句子嵌入模型在专业领域适配的挑战，保持原始模型的语义判别能力同时学习领域相关表示。

Method: 多阶段框架，结合领域特定的掩码监督，联合优化MLM和对比学习目标，采用选择性适应的统一训练流程。

Result: 在高资源和低资源领域验证，NDCG@10指标相比强通用领域基线提升高达13.4%，消融研究证明各组件有效性。

Conclusion: 平衡的联合监督和分阶段适应对于领域自适应至关重要，MOSAIC框架能有效提升句子嵌入模型在专业领域的性能。

Abstract: We introduce MOSAIC (Masked Objective with Selective Adaptation for In-domain
Contrastive learning), a multi-stage framework for domain adaptation of
sentence embedding models that incorporates joint domain-specific masked
supervision. Our approach addresses the challenges of adapting large-scale
general-domain sentence embedding models to specialized domains. By jointly
optimizing masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive objectives within a
unified training pipeline, our method enables effective learning of
domain-relevant representations while preserving the robust semantic
discrimination properties of the original model. We empirically validate our
approach on both high-resource and low-resource domains, achieving improvements
up to 13.4% in NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) over strong
general-domain baselines. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate
the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the importance of balanced
joint supervision and staged adaptation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究LLMs在实体比较任务中如何依赖启发式偏见而非真实知识进行推理，发现模型大小影响知识使用策略，思维链提示能改善推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs何时依赖真实知识而非表面启发式进行基于知识的推理任务，特别是在实体比较任务中。

Method: 通过实体比较任务（如比较河流长度）分析LLMs的预测行为，识别三种启发式偏见：实体流行度、提及顺序和语义共现，并比较不同规模模型的表现。

Result: 小模型主要依赖启发式偏见，其预测准确度甚至不如基于表面线索的简单逻辑回归；大模型能选择性使用数值知识；思维链提示能引导所有模型更好地使用数值特征。

Conclusion: 模型规模影响知识使用策略，大模型能更智能地选择可靠知识源，思维链提示是改善LLMs推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for knowledge-based
reasoning tasks, yet understanding when they rely on genuine knowledge versus
superficial heuristics remains challenging. We investigate this question
through entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along
numerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the
Nile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite
having sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make
predictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases
that strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order,
and semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression
using only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the
model's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override
principled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters)
selectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller
models (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why
larger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more
accurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using
the numerical features across all model sizes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个两阶段的检索-重排框架，使用LLM进行跨体裁作者归属任务，在HIATUS基准测试中显著超越现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨体裁作者归属任务需要识别与文本主题无关的作者特定语言模式，而传统信息检索方法依赖主题线索，不适用于此任务。

Method: 采用两阶段检索-重排框架，通过专门的数据策展策略训练重排器，使其能够有效学习作者区分性信号。

Result: 在HIATUS的HRS1和HRS2跨体裁作者归属基准测试中，分别比之前最佳方法提升了22.3和34.4个绝对Success@8点。

Conclusion: 提出的LLM检索-重排管道在跨体裁作者归属任务中取得了显著性能提升，证明了专门训练策略的重要性。

Abstract: Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of identifying the most likely author
of a query document from a predefined set of candidate authors. We introduce a
two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework that finetunes LLMs for cross-genre AA.
Unlike the field of information retrieval (IR), where retrieve-and-rerank is a
de facto strategy, cross-genre AA systems must avoid relying on topical cues
and instead learn to identify author-specific linguistic patterns that are
independent of the text's subject matter (genre/domain/topic). Consequently,
for the reranker, we demonstrate that training strategies commonly used in IR
are fundamentally misaligned with cross-genre AA, leading to suboptimal
behavior. To address this, we introduce a targeted data curation strategy that
enables the reranker to effectively learn author-discriminative signals. Using
our LLM-based retrieve-and-rerank pipeline, we achieve substantial gains of
22.3 and 34.4 absolute Success@8 points over the previous state-of-the-art on
HIATUS's challenging HRS1 and HRS2 cross-genre AA benchmarks.

TL;DR: CoRUS框架通过角色理论模拟基于不同用户角色的提问，发现在阿片类药物使用障碍等敏感领域，LLM对患者、照护者等弱势角色的回应更支持性但知识性内容减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估往往忽略提问者的角色背景，这在阿片类药物使用障碍等敏感领域尤为重要，因为用户背景对提供无污名化回应至关重要。

Method: 基于角色理论和在线OUD康复社区帖子，构建提问者角色分类（患者、照护者、从业者），并模拟15,321个嵌入各角色目标、行为和经验的提问。

Result: 模拟问题高度可信且与现实数据可比。评估5个LLM发现：相比从业者，患者和照护者等弱势角色获得更多支持性回应(+17%)但知识内容减少(-19%)。

Conclusion: 用户角色信号会系统性影响模型回应，本研究提供了基于角色的对话AI评估方法。

Abstract: Language model users often embed personal and social context in their
questions. The asker's role -- implicit in how the question is framed --
creates specific needs for an appropriate response. However, most evaluations,
while capturing the model's capability to respond, often ignore who is asking.
This gap is especially critical in stigmatized domains such as opioid use
disorder (OUD), where accounting for users' contexts is essential to provide
accessible, stigma-free responses. We propose CoRUS (COmmunity-driven Roles for
User-centric Question Simulation), a framework for simulating role-based
questions. Drawing on role theory and posts from an online OUD recovery
community (r/OpiatesRecovery), we first build a taxonomy of asker roles --
patients, caregivers, practitioners. Next, we use it to simulate 15,321
questions that embed each role's goals, behaviors, and experiences. Our
evaluations show that these questions are both highly believable and comparable
to real-world data. When used to evaluate five LLMs, for the same question but
differing roles, we find systematic differences: vulnerable roles, such as
patients and caregivers, elicit more supportive responses (+17%) and reduced
knowledge content (-19%) in comparison to practitioners. Our work demonstrates
how implicitly signaling a user's role shapes model responses, and provides a
methodology for role-informed evaluation of conversational AI.

Motivation: 生成专业财务报告是一个劳动密集且智力要求高的过程，现有AI系统难以完全自动化这一任务。

Method: 采用Code Agent with Variable Memory (CAVM)架构统一外部数据、工具和智能体；提出迭代视觉增强机制逐步优化原始视觉输出；使用两阶段写作框架将简洁的分析链扩展为连贯、引用感知的多模态报告。

Conclusion: FinSight展示了生成接近人类专家质量报告的清晰路径，为自动化专业财务报告生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating professional financial reports is a labor-intensive and
intellectually demanding process that current AI systems struggle to fully
automate. To address this challenge, we introduce FinSight (Financial InSight),
a novel multi agent framework for producing high-quality, multimodal financial
reports. The foundation of FinSight is the Code Agent with Variable Memory
(CAVM) architecture, which unifies external data, designed tools, and agents
into a programmable variable space, enabling flexible data collection, analysis
and report generation through executable code. To ensure professional-grade
visualization, we propose an Iterative Vision-Enhanced Mechanism that
progressively refines raw visual outputs into polished financial charts.
Furthermore, a two stage Writing Framework expands concise Chain-of-Analysis
segments into coherent, citation-aware, and multimodal reports, ensuring both
analytical depth and structural consistency. Experiments on various company and
industry-level tasks demonstrate that FinSight significantly outperforms all
baselines, including leading deep research systems in terms of factual
accuracy, analytical depth, and presentation quality, demonstrating a clear
path toward generating reports that approach human-expert quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代神经网络规模增长带来的效率低下和可解释性差的问题，探索如何构建能学习高效、模块化和可解释表示的大型神经系统的核心问题。

Method: 将神经网络视为神经群交互的动态系统，权重作为神经状态间的瞬时交互，通过神经群间的迭代通信进行计算。引入神经元稳定性度量来量化序列处理中的激活收缩，并揭示推理能力与外部驱动力的关系。

Result: 在大语言模型中实例化NGC，在适度压缩下在复杂推理基准上表现更优，在相同压缩率下持续优于标准低秩近似和跨层基共享方法。

Conclusion: NGC框架通过结构化神经群动态可能关联高维学习系统中的泛化能力，为构建高效、模块化和可解释的大规模神经网络提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ever-increasing scale of modern neural networks has brought unprecedented
performance alongside daunting challenges in efficiency and interpretability.
This paper addresses the core question of how to build large neural systems
that learn efficient, modular, and interpretable representations. We propose
Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a
neural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than
a monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as
an independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient
interactions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation
unfolding through iterative communication among groups of neurons. This
low-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons
exchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and
inter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant
parameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal
stability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the
contraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence
processing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities
correspond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the
neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability.
Empirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate
improved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate
compression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and
cross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude
by discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured
neuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional
learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究多模态语言模型是否比纯文本模型在具身知识理解方面有优势，基于心理学感知理论构建评估基准。

Method: 基于心理学感知理论构建具身知识理解基准，包含视觉、听觉、触觉、味觉、嗅觉和本体感觉，通过向量比较和问答任务评估30个先进语言模型。

Result: 视觉语言模型在两项任务中均未优于纯文本模型，视觉维度表现显著差于其他感官维度，向量表示易受词形和频率影响，模型难以处理空间感知推理问题。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在具身知识整合方面存在不足，需要更有效地整合具身知识以增强对物理世界的理解。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal language models (LMs), it remains
unclear whether visual grounding enhances their understanding of embodied
knowledge compared to text-only models. To address this question, we propose a
novel embodied knowledge understanding benchmark based on the perceptual theory
from psychology, encompassing visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, olfactory
external senses, and interoception. The benchmark assesses the models'
perceptual abilities across different sensory modalities through vector
comparison and question-answering tasks with over 1,700 questions. By comparing
30 state-of-the-art LMs, we surprisingly find that vision-language models
(VLMs) do not outperform text-only models in either task. Moreover, the models
perform significantly worse in the visual dimension compared to other sensory
dimensions. Further analysis reveals that the vector representations are easily
influenced by word form and frequency, and the models struggle to answer
questions involving spatial perception and reasoning. Our findings underscore
the need for more effective integration of embodied knowledge in LMs to enhance
their understanding of the physical world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型基准主要局限于高资源或中资源语言，且多评估推理和生成等高阶任务，但研究表明LLMs在世界上3800+书面语言中缺乏基本语言能力。

Method: 基于现有词典、单语数据和双语文本构建ChiKhaPo基准，包含8个不同难度的子任务，覆盖2700+语言，特别关注词汇理解和生成能力。

Result: 6个最先进的模型在该基准上表现不佳，性能得分受语言家族、语言资源丰富度、任务类型以及理解与生成方向等因素影响。

Conclusion: ChiKhaPo基准能够促进和鼓励大语言模型的大规模多语言基准测试，填补了现有基准在语言覆盖范围上的不足。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are largely restricted
to high- or mid-resource languages, and often evaluate performance on
higher-order tasks in reasoning and generation. However, plenty of evidence
points to the fact that LLMs lack basic linguistic competence in the vast
majority of the world's 3800+ written languages. We introduce ChiKhaPo,
consisting of 8 subtasks of varying difficulty designed to evaluate the lexical
comprehension and generation abilities of generative models. ChiKhaPo draws on
existing lexicons, monolingual data, and bitext, and provides coverage for
2700+ languages for 2 subtasks, surpassing any existing benchmark in terms of
language coverage. We further show that 6 SOTA models struggle on our
benchmark, and discuss the factors contributing to performance scores,
including language family, language resourcedness, task, and comprehension
versus generation directions. With ChiKhaPo, we hope to enable and encourage
the massively multilingual benchmarking of LLMs.

Motivation: 上下文学习虽然有效但推理成本高，随着上下文长度增长成本显著增加。

Method: 基于强化学习的框架来元学习指令归纳模型，从训练样本中提取紧凑但描述性的提示。

Result: 在90个未见任务上评估，PROMPT-MII将下游模型质量提升4-9个F1点（相对提升10-20%），匹配上下文学习性能但所需token数量减少3-13倍。

Conclusion: PROMPT-MII方法能够有效替代上下文学习，在保持性能的同时大幅降低推理成本。

Abstract: A popular method to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new tasks is
in-context learning (ICL), which is effective but incurs high inference costs
as context length grows. In this paper we propose a method to perform
instruction induction, where we take training examples and reduce them to a
compact but descriptive prompt that can achieve performance comparable to ICL
over the full training set. Specifically, we propose PROMPT-MII, a
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to meta-learn an instruction
induction model that can generate compact instructions on the fly for an
arbitrary new dataset. We train on over 3,000 diverse classification datasets
from the HuggingFace hub, and evaluate on 90 unseen tasks. PROMPT-MII improves
downstream model quality by 4-9 F1 points (10-20% relative), matching ICL
performance while requiring 3-13x fewer tokens.

TL;DR: 本文首次应用参数高效微调(PEFT)技术，使用LoRA和QLoRA方法在孟加拉语仇恨言论检测任务上，在BD-SHS数据集上取得了最高92.23%的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语社交媒体上的仇恨言论激增，特别是针对妇女和青少年群体。现有方法要么计算成本高昂，要么依赖专有API，需要更实用的解决方案。

Method: 使用LoRA和QLoRA参数高效微调技术，在Gemma-3-4B、Llama-3.2-3B和Mistral-7B三个指令调优大语言模型上，仅训练少于1%的参数，在50,281条标注评论的BD-SHS数据集上进行实验。

Result: Llama-3.2-3B获得最高F1分数92.23%，Mistral-7B为88.94%，Gemma-3-4B为80.25%。所有实验均在单个消费级GPU上完成。

Conclusion: PEFT被证明是孟加拉语及相关低资源语言仇恨言论检测的实用且可复现策略。

Abstract: Bengali social media platforms have witnessed a sharp increase in hate
speech, disproportionately affecting women and adolescents. While datasets such
as BD-SHS provide a basis for structured evaluation, most prior approaches rely
on either computationally costly full-model fine-tuning or proprietary APIs.
This paper presents the first application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) for Bengali hate speech detection using LoRA and QLoRA. Three
instruction-tuned large language models - Gemma-3-4B, Llama-3.2-3B, and
Mistral-7B - were fine-tuned on the BD-SHS dataset of 50,281 annotated
comments. Each model was adapted by training fewer than 1% of its parameters,
enabling experiments on a single consumer-grade GPU. The results show that
Llama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23%, followed by Mistral-7B at
88.94% and Gemma-3-4B at 80.25%. These findings establish PEFT as a practical
and replicable strategy for Bengali and related low-resource languages.

TL;DR: UTF8Tokenizer是一种极简的字节级分词器，直接将文本映射到UTF-8编码对应的字节ID，使用C0控制字节编码特殊行为，提供更快的分词速度、更小的传输开销和可共享的嵌入表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有字节级分词器引入超出范围ID或辅助标记的问题，利用ASCII原始设计理念将控制信息嵌入到文本中，实现更高效和统一的分词方案。

Method: 使用UTF-8编码的字节作为标记ID，所有特殊行为（如填充、边界、对话结构等）都通过C0控制字节编码，无需额外标记。采用256维嵌入表和位偏置嵌入技术。

Result: 分词速度提升14倍，主机-设备传输减少8倍（相比int64），嵌入表可跨模型对齐，训练时收敛性得到改善。

Conclusion: UTF8Tokenizer提供了一种高效、简洁且实用的字节级分词方案，在性能和实用性方面均有显著优势。

Abstract: We present UTF8Tokenizer, a minimalist byte-level tokenizer that maps text
exactly to IDs corresponding to the bytes underlying the text's UTF-8 encoding
(e.g., byte x09 is token ID 9). Unlike prior byte-level approaches (Xue et al.,
2021; Pagnoni et al., 2025), our implementation never introduces out-of-range
IDs (i.e. there is no token ID 256) or auxiliary tokens: all special behavior
(e.g., padding, boundaries, conversation structure, attention segments, tool
calling, "thinking" spans, etc.) is encoded using C0 control bytes - just as
ASCII was originally designed to embed control information alongside printable
text. These design principles yield practical benefits: (1) faster tokenization
(14x) and significantly lower host-device transfer (8x less than int64); (2)
simple, shareable 256*d embedding tables that can be aligned across models; and
(3) a training-time enhancement via bit-biased embeddings, which exposes
per-byte bit structure and can be added to the embedding table post-training,
removing inference costs. Our HuggingFace-compatible implementation improves
language modeling convergence.

*Yuval Reif,Guy Kaplan,Roy Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种词汇表压缩方法，通过将词形变化表示为基词向量与变换向量的组合，从而减少词汇表大小并提高多语言覆盖度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分词算法将词形变化视为独立词符，导致词汇表被表面形式变体填满，牺牲了低频词和多语言覆盖度。

Method: 使用变换向量（加法偏移量）在嵌入空间中表示词形变化，将词汇表重新设计为共享基词和变换向量的组合形式。

Result: 在多种LLM和五种语言上验证，可移除高达10%的词汇条目，扩展词汇覆盖度且对下游任务性能影响最小，无需修改模型权重。

Conclusion: 这促使词汇设计从字符串枚举转向利用语言底层结构的组合式词汇表。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) were shown to encode word form variations, such
as "walk"->"walked", as linear directions in embedding space. However, standard
tokenization algorithms treat these variations as distinct tokens -- filling
the size-capped vocabulary with surface form variants (e.g., "walk", "walking",
"Walk"), at the expense of less frequent words and multilingual coverage. We
show that many of these variations can be captured by transformation vectors --
additive offsets that yield the appropriate word's representation when applied
to the base form word embedding -- in both the input and output spaces.
Building on this, we propose a compact reshaping of the vocabulary: rather than
assigning unique tokens to each surface form, we compose them from shared base
form and transformation vectors (e.g., "walked" = "walk" + past tense). We
apply our approach to multiple LLMs and across five languages, removing up to
10% of vocabulary entries -- thereby freeing space to allocate new, more
diverse tokens. Importantly, we do so while also expanding vocabulary coverage
to out-of-vocabulary words, with minimal impact on downstream performance, and
without modifying model weights. Our findings motivate a foundational
rethinking of vocabulary design, moving from string enumeration to a
compositional vocabulary that leverages the underlying structure of language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御方法无法主动破坏迭代越狱攻击的动态试错循环，这些攻击通过反复重写提示来诱导有害输出。

Method: 使用强化学习优化提示，确保对无害任务提供适当响应，同时明确拒绝有害提示；引入Past-Direction Gradient Damping (PDGD)来防止对攻击期间探索的狭窄输入重写过拟合。

Result: 在三个LLM上的实验表明，该方法显著优于五种现有防御方法对抗五种迭代越狱方法，同时提高了无害任务的响应质量。

Conclusion: 提出的动态防御框架能有效对抗迭代越狱攻击，并在保护安全性的同时提升模型对无害任务的处理能力。

Abstract: Iterative jailbreak methods that repeatedly rewrite and input prompts into
large language models (LLMs) to induce harmful outputs -- using the model's
previous responses to guide each new iteration -- have been found to be a
highly effective attack strategy. Despite being an effective attack strategy
against LLMs and their safety mechanisms, existing defenses do not proactively
disrupt this dynamic trial-and-error cycle. In this study, we propose a novel
framework that dynamically updates its defense strategy through online learning
in response to each new prompt from iterative jailbreak methods. Leveraging the
distinctions between harmful jailbreak-generated prompts and typical harmless
prompts, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach that optimizes
prompts to ensure appropriate responses for harmless tasks while explicitly
rejecting harmful prompts. Additionally, to curb overfitting to the narrow band
of partial input rewrites explored during an attack, we introduce
Past-Direction Gradient Damping (PDGD). Experiments conducted on three LLMs
show that our approach significantly outperforms five existing defense methods
against five iterative jailbreak methods. Moreover, our results indicate that
our prompt optimization strategy simultaneously enhances response quality for
harmless tasks.

Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试主要关注自然语言理解中的显式信息提取，缺乏针对隐式信息、语用推理以及跨句子、段落和多说话者话语的语篇跟踪能力的更具挑战性的多语言基准。

Method: 提出了DiscoTrack基准测试，涵盖12种语言和四个语篇理解层次：显著性识别、实体跟踪、语篇关系和桥接推理。

Result: 评估显示这些任务即使对于最先进的模型仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: DiscoTrack填补了现有基准测试在语篇跟踪能力评估方面的空白，为LLM在多语言语篇理解方面的进一步发展提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Recent LLM benchmarks have tested models on a range of phenomena, but are
still focused primarily on natural language understanding for extraction of
explicit information, such as QA or summarization, with responses often tar-
geting information from individual sentences. We are still lacking more
challenging, and im- portantly also multilingual, benchmarks focus- ing on
implicit information and pragmatic infer- ences across larger documents in the
context of discourse tracking: integrating and aggregating information across
sentences, paragraphs and multiple speaker utterances. To this end, we present
DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages
and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity
tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that

TL;DR: 论文发现基于大语言模型的搜索代理比基础LLM更容易产生有害输出，提出了SafeSearch多目标强化学习方法，在保持问答性能的同时显著降低有害性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注提升搜索代理的实用性，但其安全行为尚未充分探索。研究发现搜索代理比基础LLM更容易产生有害输出，且实用性导向的微调会加剧这种风险

Method: 提出SafeSearch多目标强化学习方法，结合最终输出的安全/实用性奖励和查询级别的惩罚/奖励机制，惩罚不安全查询并奖励安全查询

Result: SafeSearch在三个红队测试数据集上将代理的有害性降低了70%以上，同时保持安全的帮助性响应，并与仅实用性微调的代理在问答性能上相当

Conclusion: 查询级别的奖励机制在联合提升安全性和实用性方面有效，证明了联合对齐安全性和实用性的重要性

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based search agents iteratively generate queries,
retrieve external information, and reason to answer open-domain questions.
While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their
safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search
agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce
harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track
someone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a
search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal
threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize
them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that
utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment
of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement
learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a
novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe
ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70%
across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and
matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses
confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety
and utility.

TL;DR: xLSTM是一个参数高效的毒性评论检测框架，通过余弦相似度门控、自适应特征优先级和类别重平衡机制，在Jigsaw毒性评论基准上以更少的参数和更低的延迟超越了BERT模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于transformer的模型在毒性评论检测中计算成本高、在少数毒性类别上性能下降的问题，以及传统集成方法缺乏语义适应性的局限。

Method: 提出xLSTM框架，包含余弦相似度门控机制、多源嵌入集成（GloVe、FastText、BERT CLS）、字符级BiLSTM、嵌入空间SMOTE数据增强和自适应焦点损失。

Result: 在Jigsaw毒性评论基准上达到96.0%准确率和0.88宏F1分数，在威胁和身份仇恨类别上分别比BERT提升33%和28%，参数量减少15倍，推理延迟50ms。

Conclusion: 轻量级、理论驱动的架构可以在不平衡、领域特定的NLP任务上超越大型预训练模型，建立了新的效率-适应性前沿。

Abstract: Toxic comment detection remains a challenging task, where transformer-based
models (e.g., BERT) incur high computational costs and degrade on minority
toxicity classes, while classical ensembles lack semantic adaptability. We
propose xLSTM, a parameter-efficient and theoretically grounded framework that
unifies cosine-similarity gating, adaptive feature prioritization, and
principled class rebalancing. A learnable reference vector {v} in {R}^d
modulates contextual embeddings via cosine similarity, amplifying toxic cues
and attenuating benign signals to yield stronger gradients under severe class
imbalance. xLSTM integrates multi-source embeddings (GloVe, FastText, BERT CLS)
through a projection layer, a character-level BiLSTM for morphological cues,
embedding-space SMOTE for minority augmentation, and adaptive focal loss with
dynamic class weighting. On the Jigsaw Toxic Comment benchmark, xLSTM attains
96.0% accuracy and 0.88 macro-F1, outperforming BERT by 33% on threat and 28%
on identity_hate categories, with 15 times fewer parameters and 50ms inference
latency. Cosine gating contributes a +4.8% F1 gain in ablations. The results
establish a new efficiency adaptability frontier, demonstrating that
lightweight, theoretically informed architectures can surpass large pretrained
models on imbalanced, domain-specific NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型的提示敏感性问题，提出通过语义空间采样和新的不确定性分解指标来改善不确定性校准，揭示了LLM在输入语义理解上缺乏一致性推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型对语义相同的不同提示会产生不同的答案分布，这表明模型的不确定性可能无法准确反映对提示语义的真实不确定性。

Method: 将提示敏感性建模为泛化误差，通过语义概念空间的释义扰动进行采样，并引入新的不确定性分解指标来量化提示敏感性对不确定性的贡献。

Result: 语义空间采样改善了不确定性校准而不影响准确性，新的分解指标能够有效量化LLM不确定性中归因于提示敏感性的部分。

Conclusion: 该方法为改善提示敏感语言模型的不确定性校准提供了新途径，证明某些LLM在输入语义理解上缺乏一致性的通用推理能力。

Abstract: An interesting behavior in large language models (LLMs) is prompt
sensitivity. When provided with different but semantically equivalent versions
of the same prompt, models may produce very different distributions of answers.
This suggests that the uncertainty reflected in a model's output distribution
for one prompt may not reflect the model's uncertainty about the meaning of the
prompt. We model prompt sensitivity as a type of generalization error, and show
that sampling across the semantic ``concept space'' with paraphrasing
perturbations improves uncertainty calibration without compromising accuracy.
Additionally, we introduce a new metric for uncertainty decomposition in
black-box LLMs that improves upon entropy-based decomposition by modeling
semantic continuities in natural language generation. We show that this
decomposition metric can be used to quantify how much LLM uncertainty is
attributed to prompt sensitivity. Our work introduces a new way to improve
uncertainty calibration in prompt-sensitive language models, and provides
evidence that some LLMs fail to exhibit consistent general reasoning about the
meanings of their inputs.

TL;DR: 研究发现基于推理的大语言模型在内部思考过程中会聚合社会偏见，揭示了两种失败模式：刻板印象重复和无关信息注入，并提出了一种轻量级的提示缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于推理的大语言模型在复杂任务中表现出色，但研究发现其内部思考过程会聚合社会偏见，导致有偏见的输出结果，而这种现象的底层机制尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 系统研究思考过程中的机制，识别出两种驱动社会偏见聚合的失败模式，并引入一种轻量级的基于提示的缓解方法，让模型审查自己的初始推理过程。

Result: 在问答（BBQ和StereoSet）和开放式（BOLD）基准测试中，该方法有效减少了偏见，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了大语言模型在推理过程中聚合社会偏见的机制，并提出了一种有效的缓解方法，为开发更公平的语言模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While reasoning-based large language models excel at complex tasks through an
internal, structured thinking process, a concerning phenomenon has emerged that
such a thinking process can aggregate social stereotypes, leading to biased
outcomes. However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social
bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically
investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and
uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype
repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary
justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or
introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these
insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that
queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific
failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and
open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias
while maintaining or improving accuracy.

TL;DR: VeriMAP是一个用于多智能体协作的验证感知规划框架，通过分解任务、建模子任务依赖关系，并编码验证函数来提升系统鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协作面临规划、协调和验证的挑战，执行失败往往源于任务解释、输出格式或智能体间交接的细微偏差，而非单纯的推理缺陷。

Method: VeriMAP规划器分解任务，建模子任务依赖关系，并将规划器定义的通过标准编码为Python和自然语言的子任务验证函数。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的评估表明，VeriMAP优于单智能体和多智能体基线，同时增强了系统鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 验证感知规划能够在多智能体系统中实现可靠的协调和迭代优化，无需依赖外部标签或注释。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to tackle complex
tasks, often necessitating collaboration among multiple specialized agents.
However, multi-agent collaboration introduces new challenges in planning,
coordination, and verification. Execution failures frequently arise not from
flawed reasoning alone, but from subtle misalignments in task interpretation,
output format, or inter-agent handoffs. To address these challenges, we present
VeriMAP, a framework for multi-agent collaboration with verification-aware
planning. The VeriMAP planner decomposes tasks, models subtask dependencies,
and encodes planner-defined passing criteria as subtask verification functions
(VFs) in Python and natural language. We evaluate VeriMAP on diverse datasets,
demonstrating that it outperforms both single- and multi-agent baselines while
enhancing system robustness and interpretability. Our analysis highlights how
verification-aware planning enables reliable coordination and iterative
refinement in multi-agent systems, without relying on external labels or
annotations.

TL;DR: DVAGen是一个开源动态词汇增强框架，解决传统语言模型处理新词和词汇外单词的局限性，提供模块化训练、评估和可视化工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定词汇表训练的语言模型难以泛化到新词或词汇外单词，现有动态词汇方法存在代码库碎片化、缺乏现代LLM支持、推理扩展性有限等问题。

Method: 开发DVAGen框架，模块化处理流程，无缝集成开源LLM，提供CLI和WebUI工具进行实时结果检查，支持批量推理。

Result: 验证了动态词汇方法在现代LLM上的有效性，显著提高了推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: DVAGen为动态词汇增强语言模型提供了统一、可扩展的解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Language models trained with a fixed vocabulary struggle to generalize to
novel or out-of-vocabulary words, limiting their flexibility in handling
diverse token combinations. Existing dynamic vocabulary approaches attempt to
address this limitation but face challenges such as fragmented codebases, lack
of support for modern LLMs, and limited inference scalability. To overcome
these issues, we introduce DVAGen, a fully open-source, unified framework
designed for training, evaluation, and visualization of dynamic
vocabulary-augmented language models. Our framework modularizes the pipeline
for ease of customization, integrates seamlessly with open-source LLMs, and is
the first to provide both CLI and WebUI tools for real-time result inspection.
We validate the effectiveness of dynamic vocabulary methods on modern LLMs and
demonstrate support for batch inference, significantly improving inference
throughput.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统比较了基于提示和基于强化学习的查询增强方法，发现简单的无训练查询增强方法在强大LLM下表现与昂贵的RL方法相当甚至更好，并提出了一种结合两者优势的混合方法OPQE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在信息检索中的查询增强主要有两种方法：基于提示生成答案或伪文档，以及基于强化学习的查询重写。这两种方法各有优势但缺乏系统比较，因此需要一致的实验条件来评估它们的性能。

Method: 提出了OPQE方法，该方法不是重写查询，而是让LLM策略学习生成能够最大化检索性能的伪文档，从而结合了提示的灵活性和RL的针对性优化。

Result: 实验表明，简单的无训练查询增强方法在强大LLM下与RL方法表现相当甚至更好。OPQE混合方法在证据搜索、临时检索和工具检索等多样化基准测试中优于单独的提示方法和RL重写方法。

Conclusion: 协同方法能产生最佳结果，OPQE通过结合提示的生成结构和RL的优化目标，在查询增强方面取得了更好的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of
interest in query augmentation for information retrieval (IR). Two main
approaches have emerged. The first prompts LLMs to generate answers or
pseudo-documents that serve as new queries, relying purely on the model's
parametric knowledge or contextual information. The second applies
reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune LLMs for query rewriting, directly
optimizing retrieval metrics. While having respective advantages and
limitations, the two approaches have not been compared under consistent
experimental conditions. In this work, we present the first systematic
comparison of prompting-based and RL-based query augmentation across diverse
benchmarks, including evidence-seeking, ad hoc, and tool retrieval. Our key
finding is that simple, training-free query augmentation often performs on par
with, or even surpasses, more expensive RL-based counterparts, especially when
using powerful LLMs. Motivated by this discovery, we introduce a novel hybrid
method, On-policy Pseudo-document Query Expansion (OPQE), which, instead of
rewriting a query, the LLM policy learns to generate a pseudo-document that
maximizes retrieval performance, thus merging the flexibility and generative
structure of prompting with the targeted optimization of RL. We show OPQE
outperforms both standalone prompting and RL-based rewriting, demonstrating
that a synergistic approach yields the best results. Our implementation is made
available to facilitate reproducibility.

TL;DR: 研究表明人们在理解AI生成的讽刺时不会完全采用意向性立场，行为上更倾向于将AI的不一致解释为计算错误，神经数据显示P200和P600效应减弱，表明对AI的沟通意图归因减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型越来越多地被部署为社交代理并训练产生幽默和讽刺，需要研究人们在遇到机智的AI言论时，是将其解释为有意的沟通还是纯粹的计算输出。

Method: 比较了AI与人类来源的讽刺陈述的行为和神经反应，使用已建立的ERP成分：P200反映早期不一致性检测，P600索引重新解释不一致性为故意讽刺的认知努力。

Result: 行为上参与者对两种来源都归因于故意沟通，但对AI的归因显著少于人类；神经数据显示AI生成讽刺的P200和P600效应减弱，表明努力检测和重新分析的减少。

Conclusion: 尽管当前LLMs具有语言复杂性，但实现真正的社交代理需要的不仅仅是语言能力，还需要人类如何感知和归因于人工代理的意向性发生转变。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as social agents
and trained to produce humor and irony, a question emerges: when encountering
witty AI remarks, do people interpret these as intentional communication or
mere computational output? This study investigates whether people adopt the
intentional stance, attributing mental states to explain behavior,toward AI
during irony comprehension. Irony provides an ideal paradigm because it
requires distinguishing intentional contradictions from unintended errors
through effortful semantic reanalysis. We compared behavioral and neural
responses to ironic statements from AI versus human sources using established
ERP components: P200 reflecting early incongruity detection and P600 indexing
cognitive efforts in reinterpreting incongruity as deliberate irony. Results
demonstrate that people do not fully adopt the intentional stance toward
AI-generated irony. Behaviorally, participants attributed incongruity to
deliberate communication for both sources, though significantly less for AI
than human, showing greater tendency to interpret AI incongruities as
computational errors. Neural data revealed attenuated P200 and P600 effects for
AI-generated irony, suggesting reduced effortful detection and reanalysis
consistent with diminished attribution of communicative intent. Notably, people
who perceived AI as more sincere showed larger P200 and P600 effects for
AI-generated irony, suggesting that intentional stance adoption is calibrated
by specific mental models of artificial agents. These findings reveal that
source attribution shapes neural processing of social-communicative phenomena.
Despite current LLMs' linguistic sophistication, achieving genuine social
agency requires more than linguistic competence, it necessitates a shift in how
humans perceive and attribute intentionality to artificial agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了基于分块的稀疏注意力模型，提出了三个关键设计原则：表达性分块编码器、旁路残差路径和训练期间强制选择稀疏性，实现了从4K上下文到3200万token的无训练长度外推。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer受限于二次复杂度和长度外推能力差，而滑动窗口注意力等替代架构由于固定大小内存无法有效利用完整上下文。需要理解分块稀疏注意力成功的关键架构原则。

Method: 通过统一框架和全面消融研究，识别出三个关键设计原则：1) 带专用CLS token的表达性非线性分块编码器；2) 旁路残差路径稳定整合检索到的全局信息；3) 预训练期间强制选择稀疏性以弥合训练-测试分布差距。

Result: 结合这些原则，在RULER和BABILong上实现了新的最先进的无训练长度外推性能，成功将4K上下文训练的模型推广到3200万token。

Conclusion: 研究为开发未来高性能长上下文语言模型提供了一套清晰且经验基础的设计原则，证明了分块内信息处理和地标生成的理论动机。

Abstract: Effectively processing long contexts is a critical challenge for language
models. While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and
poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window
attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize
the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention
has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the
key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully
understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to
identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified
framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination
of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk
Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval;
(2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information
without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced
selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution
gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing
and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new
state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully
generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and
BABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design
principles for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法面临两难：激进遗忘损害模型效用，保守策略保留效用但可能导致幻觉响应，限制了LLMs在知识密集型应用中的可靠性。

Method: 采用注意力转移框架，包含两个核心组件：上下文保持抑制（减弱对事实承载token的注意力）和抗幻觉响应塑造（阻止对遗忘内容的虚构补全），通过重要性感知抑制和注意力引导保留增强实现。

Result: 在ToFU基准测试中准确率提升15%，在TDEC基准测试中准确率提升10%，同时保持竞争力的无幻觉遗忘效果。

Conclusion: AS框架在遗忘效果、泛化能力和响应可靠性之间实现了优越的平衡，相比现有方法表现更佳。

Abstract: The increase in computing power and the necessity of AI-assisted
decision-making boost the growing application of large language models (LLMs).
Along with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred
increasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning
approaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model
utility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated
responses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive
applications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS)
framework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1)
context-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens
without disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant
response shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about
unlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level
interventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning
set to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention
enhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in
the retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components
are jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary
that localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under
representation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves
performance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods,
achieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC
benchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning
effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance
between unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.

TL;DR: 提出StreamingThinker框架，让LLMs在输入过程中就开始推理，而不是等全部输入完成后再推理，显著降低了推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理范式需要等待完整输入才开始思考，这在动态场景中引入了不必要的延迟并削弱了对早期信息的注意力。

Method: 设计流式思维范式，通过流式CoT生成、流式约束训练和流式并行推理，让模型在阅读过程中就开始推理。

Result: 在数学推理、逻辑推理和基于上下文的QA推理任务上，StreamingThinker保持了与批量推理相当的性能，同时将推理开始前的token等待时间减少了80%，最终答案的时间级延迟减少了60%以上。

Conclusion: 流式思维范式为LLM推理提供了有效的低延迟解决方案，显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm
initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces
unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic
scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first
design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where
reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once
reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with
\textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading
through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint
training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker
employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation,
enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and
position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input
encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling
true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across
math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks.
Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance
comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting
before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level
latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了VideoBiasEval框架，用于评估视频生成模型中的社会偏见，发现对齐调优会放大并稳定化社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型通过奖励模型进行对齐调优以提升视觉质量，但会无意中编码和放大社会偏见，需要系统评估这种偏见的演变过程。

Method: 引入VideoBiasEval诊断框架，基于社会偏见分类学，采用基于事件的提示策略分离语义内容和演员属性，并引入多粒度指标评估偏见。

Result: 研究发现对齐调优不仅强化了表征偏见，还使其在时间上更稳定，产生更平滑但更刻板的描绘。

Conclusion: 需要在对齐过程中进行偏见感知的评估和缓解，以确保公平和社会责任的视频生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced
text-to-video generation, particularly through alignment tuning using reward
models trained on human preferences. While these methods improve visual
quality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To
systematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline,
we introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating
social representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias
taxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to
disentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes
(gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to
evaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity,
(3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4)
the temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we
conduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference
datasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through
alignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment
tuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them
temporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These
findings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout
the alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新闻媒体通过报道框架影响公众情绪，负面或情绪化的标题往往获得更多关注和传播，这促使媒体采用更能引发强烈反应的报道方式。研究旨在探索孟加拉语新闻中的这种情感倾向。

Method: 使用Gemma-3 4B模型进行零样本推理，分析了30万条孟加拉语新闻标题及其内容，识别每条新闻的主导情绪和整体基调。

Result: 研究发现负面情绪明显占主导地位，特别是愤怒、恐惧和失望，不同媒体对相似故事的报道存在显著的情感差异。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，提出了以人为中心的新闻聚合器设计方案，通过可视化情感线索帮助读者识别日常新闻中隐藏的情感框架。

Abstract: News media often shape the public mood not only by what they report but by
how they frame it. The same event can appear calm in one outlet and alarming in
another, reflecting subtle emotional bias in reporting. Negative or emotionally
charged headlines tend to attract more attention and spread faster, which in
turn encourages outlets to frame stories in ways that provoke stronger
reactions. This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion
analysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we
analyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the
dominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear
dominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment,
and significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed
across outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a
human-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers
recognize hidden affective framing in daily news.

Abstract: Large language models have exhibited impressive performance across a broad
range of downstream tasks in natural language processing. However, how a
language model predicts the next token and generates content is not generally
understandable by humans. Furthermore, these models often make errors in
prediction and reasoning, known as hallucinations. These errors underscore the
urgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of
language models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this
gap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic
interpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust
in such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions.
First, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic
interpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the
literature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and
reasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and
autonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations
for explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in
the evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities,
critical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned,
trustworthy LLM explanations.

*Avishek Lahiri,Yufang Hou,Debarshi Kumar Sanyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了TaxoAlign方法用于自动生成学术分类法，并创建了CS-TaxoBench基准数据集，通过严格的评估框架验证了该方法在结构对齐和语义连贯性方面优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动文献综述生成方法缺乏与人工专家撰写结构的比较，需要弥合人工生成与自动创建分类法之间的差距。

Method: 提出了TaxoAlign方法，这是一个基于主题的三阶段指令引导的学术分类法生成方法，并建立了包含460个分类法的CS-TaxoBench基准数据集。

Result: TaxoAlign在几乎所有评估指标上都持续超越了基线方法，在结构对齐和语义连贯性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: TaxoAlign方法能够有效生成与人工专家分类法结构对齐的学术分类法，为自动文献综述提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: Taxonomies play a crucial role in helping researchers structure and navigate
knowledge in a hierarchical manner. They also form an important part in the
creation of comprehensive literature surveys. The existing approaches to
automatic survey generation do not compare the structure of the generated
surveys with those written by human experts. To address this gap, we present
our own method for automated taxonomy creation that can bridge the gap between
human-generated and automatically-created taxonomies. For this purpose, we
create the CS-TaxoBench benchmark which consists of 460 taxonomies that have
been extracted from human-written survey papers. We also include an additional
test set of 80 taxonomies curated from conference survey papers. We propose
TaxoAlign, a three-phase topic-based instruction-guided method for scholarly
taxonomy generation. Additionally, we propose a stringent automated evaluation
framework that measures the structural alignment and semantic coherence of
automatically generated taxonomies in comparison to those created by human
experts. We evaluate our method and various baselines on CS-TaxoBench, using
both automated evaluation metrics and human evaluation studies. The results
show that TaxoAlign consistently surpasses the baselines on nearly all metrics.

*Hajar Bakarou,Mohamed Sinane El Messoussi,Anaïs Ollagnier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究使用CyberAgressionAdo-Large法语数据集，在多轮对话环境中评估了反社会行为检测、欺凌行为分析和欺凌同伴群体识别三个任务，发现多模态模型优于单模态基线，其中mBERT + WD-SGCN的后期融合模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的反社会行为（如仇恨言论、骚扰和网络欺凌）对平台安全和社福祉构成日益严重的风险。现有研究主要集中在X和Reddit等网络平台，而多轮对话环境由于数据有限而研究不足。

Method: 使用CyberAgressionAdo-Large法语开放数据集模拟多轮对话中的反社会行为，评估了6种基于文本和8种基于图的表示学习方法，分析了词汇线索、交互动态及其多模态融合。

Result: 多模态模型优于单模态基线。后期融合模型mBERT + WD-SGCN取得了最佳整体结果，在滥用检测任务上表现最佳（0.718），在同伴群体识别（0.286）和欺凌分析（0.606）上获得有竞争力的分数。

Conclusion: 错误分析表明该模型在处理微妙的反社会行为现象（如隐性攻击、角色转换和上下文相关敌意）方面表现出色，多模态方法在多轮对话反社会行为检测中具有优势。

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media -- including hate speech,
harassment, and cyberbullying -- poses growing risks to platform safety and
societal well-being. Prior research has focused largely on networks such as X
and Reddit, while \textit{multi-party conversational settings} remain
underexplored due to limited data. To address this gap, we use
\textit{CyberAgressionAdo-Large}, a French open-access dataset simulating ASB
in multi-party conversations, and evaluate three tasks: \textit{abuse
detection}, \textit{bullying behavior analysis}, and \textit{bullying
peer-group identification}. We benchmark six text-based and eight graph-based
\textit{representation-learning methods}, analyzing lexical cues, interactional
dynamics, and their multimodal fusion. Results show that multimodal models
outperform unimodal baselines. The late fusion model \texttt{mBERT + WD-SGCN}
achieves the best overall results, with top performance on abuse detection
(0.718) and competitive scores on peer-group identification (0.286) and
bullying analysis (0.606). Error analysis highlights its effectiveness in
handling nuanced ASB phenomena such as implicit aggression, role transitions,
and context-dependent hostility.

*Chenghao Zhang,Guanting Dong,Xinyu Yang,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Nyx，一个统一的多模态到多模态检索器，用于解决通用检索增强生成(URAG)中的混合模态信息检索和推理挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统主要关注单模态文本文档，在现实场景中当查询和文档都包含混合模态（如文本和图像）时表现不足。

Method: 构建NyxQA数据集，采用四阶段自动管道生成和过滤混合模态问答对；使用两阶段训练框架：先在NyxQA和开源检索数据集上预训练，然后通过下游视觉语言模型的反馈进行监督微调。

Result: Nyx不仅在标准文本RAG基准上表现有竞争力，在更通用和现实的URAG设置中表现优异，显著提高了视觉语言任务的生成质量。

Conclusion: Nyx成功解决了混合模态检索增强生成的挑战，为现实世界多模态信息需求提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an
external corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text
documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and
documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this
paper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to
improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified
mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate
the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated
pipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct
NyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that
better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality
dataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform
pre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets,
followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream
vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative
preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs
competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more
general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality
in vision-language tasks.

### [71] [The Atomic Instruction Gap: Instruction-Tuned LLMs Struggle with Simple, Self-Contained Directives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17388)
*Henry Lim,Kwan Hui Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现指令调优大语言模型在简单指令执行上存在严重不足，特别是对选项标签格式（字母、数字、罗马数字）敏感，即使含义相同也会导致性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索指令调优大语言模型执行简单、自包含指令的能力，这是复杂指令遵循的基础，但目前研究不足。

Method: 在修改后的MMLU和MMLU-Pro基准上评估20个指令调优大语言模型，系统性地改变选项标签格式（字母、数字、罗马数字），在四种范式下测试模型表现。

Result: 标签格式变化导致性能显著波动（如罗马数字vs数字下降30.45%），移除指令后性能进一步下降，移除选项内容时模型无法超越随机基准，三样本示例无法提升鲁棒性，大模型准确率更高但指令遵循仍不一致。

Conclusion: 当前指令调优范式存在不足，需要专门针对原子指令遵循的评估方法和训练策略。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot
reasoning, yet their ability to execute simple, self-contained instructions
remains underexplored, despite this being foundational to complex
instruction-following. We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro
benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic,
numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms,
namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance
shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format
bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and
label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3)
When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except
with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4)
Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and
generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric
formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain
inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies
of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation
methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic
instruction-following.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EduAdapt基准，包含近48k个按年级标注的科学问答对，用于评估LLM在不同年级水平上的适应性。研究发现大模型在低年级表现不佳，这是首个评估LLM年级适应性的数据集和框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在学术基准上表现良好，但无法根据学生年级水平调整回答内容。K-12教育需要年龄合适的词汇和解释，而现有模型输出往往过于复杂或模糊，缺乏标准化评估基准。

Method: 构建EduAdapt基准数据集，包含约48k个按年级标注的QA对，涵盖9个科学科目，分为4个年级组（1-12年级）。评估多个开源LLM在该基准上的表现。

Result: 大模型整体表现更好，但在低年级（1-5年级）仍难以生成合适的回答。模型在年级适应性方面存在明显挑战。

Conclusion: EduAdapt是首个评估LLM年级适应性的数据集和框架，旨在通过改进训练和提示策略，开发更适合教育发展的AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming education by answering
questions, explaining complex concepts, and generating content across a wide
range of subjects. Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they
often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical
need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are
essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs
that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no
standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive
and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a
benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects,
spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse
set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally
perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for
early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and
evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to
foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better
training and prompting strategies. EduAdapt code and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/NaumanNaeem/EduAdapt.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ladder-base是首个采用GRPO强化学习方法训练的中医领域大语言模型，在多个推理指标上超越了通用和中医专用模型，展现了在传统医学领域实现专家级推理的有效策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统中医知识体系独特且复杂，现有中医专用大语言模型在一致性、数据质量和评估标准方面存在局限，需要更有效的对齐方法来提升推理能力和事实一致性。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct基础模型，使用GRPO（组相对策略优化）强化学习方法，在TCM-Ladder基准的文本子集上进行训练，80%数据用于训练，剩余20%均分用于验证和测试。

Result: Ladder-base在标准化评估中表现优异，在多个推理指标上超越了GPT-4、Gemini 2.5、Claude 3、Qwen3等通用模型，以及BenTsao、HuatuoGPT2、Zhongjing等中医专用模型。

Conclusion: GRPO为在传统医学领域实现大语言模型与专家级推理的对齐提供了有效且高效的策略，支持开发可信赖且基于临床实践的中医人工智能系统。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a rich and structurally unique
knowledge system that challenges conventional applications of large language
models (LLMs). Although previous TCM-specific LLMs have shown progress through
supervised fine-tuning, they often face limitations in alignment, data quality,
and evaluation consistency. In this study, we introduce Ladder-base, the first
TCM-focused LLM trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
reinforcement learning method that improves reasoning and factual consistency
by optimizing response selection based on intra-group comparisons. Ladder-base
is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively
on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data
for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and
test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior
performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both
state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and
Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and
Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient
strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical
domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM
artificial intelligence systems.

Conclusion: 本研究证明了通过基于自然语言的指令调优和多模态整合开发中医领域大语言模型的可行性，为生成式AI与传统医学推理的对齐提供了实用框架，并为现实世界部署提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two
millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language
models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic
reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain
LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal
integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these
limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM,
integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback
refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning
rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and
ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive
knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based
instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation
mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process
involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for
tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic
access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question
benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior
accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics,
herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an
interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000
users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of
developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning
and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning
generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for
real-world deployment.

*Tiancheng Hu,Benjamin Minixhofer,Nigel Collier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文显示对齐过程不仅导致任务准确率下降，还造成严重的校准损失，使模型过度自信、可靠性降低且输出多样性减少。通过简单的权重插值方法可以找到帕累托最优解，在提高准确率的同时恢复校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对齐税（alignment tax）的完整影响，发现除了已知的任务准确率下降外，还涉及校准损失问题，这使得模型变得过度自信且可靠性降低。

Method: 采用简单的后处理干预方法：在对齐前后的模型权重之间进行插值，寻找帕累托最优的插值点。

Result: 该方法能够找到帕累托最优的插值模型，这些模型不仅准确率超过两个父模型，还显著恢复了在对齐过程中损失的校准性能。

Conclusion: 简单的模型合并提供了一种计算高效的方法来缓解对齐税的全面影响，产生更强大且更可靠的模型。

Abstract: The "alignment tax" of post-training is typically framed as a drop in task
accuracy. We show it also involves a severe loss of calibration, making models
overconfident, less reliable, and model outputs less diverse. We show that this
trade-off can be navigated effectively via a simple post-hoc intervention:
interpolating between a model's weights before and after alignment. Crucially,
this is not a strict trade-off. We find that the process consistently reveals
Pareto-optimal interpolations - models that improve accuracy beyond both
parents while substantially recovering the calibration lost during alignment.
Our work demonstrates that simple model merging provides a computationally
efficient method for mitigating the full scope of the alignment tax, yielding
models that are more capable and more reliable.

*Yushi Yang,Shreyansh Padarha,Andrew Lee,Adam Mahdi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL训练的搜索模型虽然继承了指令调优的拒绝能力，但存在脆弱性。两种简单攻击（搜索攻击和多搜索攻击）能显著降低模型的安全性能，暴露了当前RL训练忽视安全性的核心弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RL训练的搜索模型的安全特性，了解其拒绝有害请求的能力和脆弱性。

Method: 使用两种简单攻击方法：搜索攻击（强制模型以搜索开始响应）和多搜索攻击（鼓励模型重复搜索），在Qwen和Llama模型家族上进行测试。

Result: 攻击使拒绝率降低达60.0%，回答安全性降低82.5%，搜索查询安全性降低82.4%。攻击通过触发模型生成有害的镜像搜索查询来绕过继承的拒绝标记。

Conclusion: 当前RL训练存在核心弱点，只奖励有效查询生成而忽视其危害性，迫切需要开发安全感知的智能体RL管道来优化安全搜索。

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) trains large language models to
autonomously call tools during reasoning, with search as the most common
application. These models excel at multi-step reasoning tasks, but their safety
properties are not well understood. In this study, we show that RL-trained
search models inherit refusal from instruction tuning and often deflect harmful
requests by turning them into safe queries. However, this safety is fragile.
Two simple attacks, one that forces the model to begin response with search
(Search attack), another that encourages models to repeatedly search
(Multi-search attack), trigger cascades of harmful searches and answers. Across
two model families (Qwen, Llama) with both local and web search, these attacks
lower refusal rates by up to 60.0%, answer safety by 82.5%, and search-query
safety by 82.4%. The attacks succeed by triggering models to generate harmful,
request-mirroring search queries before they can generate the inherited refusal
tokens. This exposes a core weakness of current RL training: it rewards
continued generation of effective queries without accounting for their
harmfulness. As a result, RL search models have vulnerabilities that users can
easily exploit, making it urgent to develop safety-aware agentic RL pipelines
optimising for safe search.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing volume of electronic health record (EHR) data
underscores a pressing need to unlock biomedical knowledge from unstructured
clinical texts to support advancements in data-driven clinical systems,
including patient diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, treatment effects
assessment, prediction of future clinical events, etc. While contextualized
language models have demonstrated impressive performance improvements for named
entity recognition (NER) systems in English corpora, there remains a scarcity
of research focused on clinical texts in low-resource languages. To bridge this
gap, our study aims to develop multiple deep contextual embedding models to
enhance clinical NER in the cardiology domain, as part of the BioASQ
MultiCardioNER shared task. We explore the effectiveness of different
monolingual and multilingual BERT-based models, trained on general domain text,
for extracting disease and medication mentions from clinical case reports
written in English, Spanish, and Italian. We achieved an F1-score of 77.88% on
Spanish Diseases Recognition (SDR), 92.09% on Spanish Medications Recognition
(SMR), 91.74% on English Medications Recognition (EMR), and 88.9% on Italian

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语翻译是机器翻译中的重大挑战，特别是对于乌尔都语等低资源语言，此前研究关注有限。

Method: 构建首个乌尔都语到英语习语翻译评估数据集，评估多种开源LLM和NMT系统，使用BLEU、BERTScore、COMET和XCOMET等自动指标评估翻译质量。

Result: 提示工程相比直接翻译能提升习语翻译质量，但不同提示类型间差异较小；原生乌尔都语输入比罗马化乌尔都语产生更准确的习语翻译。

Conclusion: 文本表示对翻译质量有显著影响，原生脚本在习语翻译中表现更优，提示工程是提升习语翻译的有效方法。

Abstract: Idiomatic translation remains a significant challenge in machine translation,
especially for low resource languages such as Urdu, and has received limited
prior attention. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first
evaluation datasets for Urdu to English idiomatic translation, covering both
Native Urdu and Roman Urdu scripts and annotated with gold-standard English
equivalents. We evaluate multiple open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems on this task, focusing on their
ability to preserve idiomatic and cultural meaning. Automatic metrics including
BLEU, BERTScore, COMET, and XCOMET are used to assess translation quality. Our
findings indicate that prompt engineering enhances idiomatic translation
compared to direct translation, though performance differences among prompt
types are relatively minor. Moreover, cross script comparisons reveal that text
representation substantially affects translation quality, with Native Urdu
inputs producing more accurate idiomatic translations than Roman Urdu.

Result: 发现维基百科覆盖度和LLM事实对齐存在显著跨语言差异。所有LLM的回答都更倾向于与英语维基百科对齐，即使提示为非英语。提供非英语维基百科的上下文片段能有效将事实对齐转向文化相关知识。

Conclusion: 这些结果为构建更公平的多语言医疗AI系统提供了实用路径，强调了通过上下文信息可以改善非英语语言的事实对齐问题。

Abstract: Equitable access to reliable health information is vital when integrating AI
into healthcare. Yet, information quality varies across languages, raising
concerns about the reliability and consistency of multilingual Large Language
Models (LLMs). We systematically examine cross-lingual disparities in
pre-training source and factuality alignment in LLM answers for multilingual
healthcare Q&A across English, German, Turkish, Chinese (Mandarin), and
Italian. We (i) constructed Multilingual Wiki Health Care
(MultiWikiHealthCare), a multilingual dataset from Wikipedia; (ii) analyzed
cross-lingual healthcare coverage; (iii) assessed LLM response alignment with
these references; and (iv) conducted a case study on factual alignment through
the use of contextual information and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our
findings reveal substantial cross-lingual disparities in both Wikipedia
coverage and LLM factual alignment. Across LLMs, responses align more with
English Wikipedia, even when the prompts are non-English. Providing contextual
excerpts from non-English Wikipedia at inference time effectively shifts
factual alignment toward culturally relevant knowledge. These results highlight
practical pathways for building more equitable, multilingual AI systems for
healthcare.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReXMoE是一种新的MoE架构，通过跨层复用专家来改进路由机制，在固定参数预算下提升模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE架构受限于层局部路由机制，每层只能使用自己的专家池，需要在专家维度和路由多样性之间权衡。ReXMoE旨在突破这一限制。

Method: 提出ReXMoE架构，允许路由器在相邻层间复用专家；采用渐进缩放路由策略，在训练过程中逐步增加候选专家池。

Result: 在0.5B到7B参数的模型上实验表明，ReXMoE在固定架构维度下持续提升语言建模和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: ReXMoE为参数高效且可扩展的MoE基LLM提供了新的设计范式。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach
to scale Large Language Models (LLMs). MoE boosts the efficiency by activating
a subset of experts per token. Recent works show that fine-grained experts
substantially enriches the combinatorial flexibility of active experts and
enhances model expressiveness. However, such a design is fundamentally limited
by the layer-local routing mechanism: each layer is restricted to its own
expert pool. This requires a careful trade-off between expert dimensionality
and routing diversity given fixed parameter budgets. We describe ReXMoE, a
novel MoE architecture that improves routing beyond the existing layer-local
approaches by allowing routers to reuse experts across adjacent layers. ReXMoE
decouples expert dimensionality from per-layer budgets, enabling richer expert
combinations without sacrificing individual expert capacity or inflating
overall parameters. To this end, we propose a new progressive scaling routing
(PSR) strategy to gradually increase the candidate expert pool during training.
As a result, ReXMoE improves both language modeling and downstream task
performance. Extensive experiments on models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters
across different architectures demonstrate that ReXMoE consistently improves
performance under fixed architectural dimensions, confirming ReXMoE as new
design paradigm for parameter-efficient and scalable MoE-based LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了DETree方法，通过层次亲和树结构建模不同AI-人类协作文本生成过程的关系，并开发了RealBench基准数据集，在混合文本检测任务中提升了性能、鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测AI参与生成的文本对于打击错误信息、抄袭和学术不端行为至关重要。当前方法对AI-人类协作过程建模较为粗糙，主要采用二元分类或多分类方法，无法有效处理复杂协作过程产生的文本特征。

Method: 提出DETree方法，将不同生成过程的关系建模为层次亲和树结构，引入专门设计的损失函数使文本表示与树结构对齐。开发了RealBench基准数据集，自动包含各种人类-AI协作过程产生的混合文本。

Result: 该方法在混合文本检测任务中提升了性能，显著增强了在分布外场景下的鲁棒性和泛化能力，特别是在少样本学习条件下，进一步证明了基于训练的方法在OOD设置中的潜力。

Conclusion: DETree方法通过层次亲和树结构有效建模了AI-人类协作文本生成过程的关系，在混合文本检测中表现出优越性能，为处理复杂AI生成文本检测提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting AI-involved text is essential for combating misinformation,
plagiarism, and academic misconduct. However, AI text generation includes
diverse collaborative processes (AI-written text edited by humans,
human-written text edited by AI, and AI-generated text refined by other AI),
where various or even new LLMs could be involved. Texts generated through these
varied processes exhibit complex characteristics, presenting significant
challenges for detection. Current methods model these processes rather crudely,
primarily employing binary classification (purely human vs. AI-involved) or
multi-classification (treating human-AI collaboration as a new class). We
observe that representations of texts generated through different processes
exhibit inherent clustering relationships. Therefore, we propose DETree, a
novel approach that models the relationships among different processes as a
Hierarchical Affinity Tree structure, and introduces a specialized loss
function that aligns text representations with this tree. To facilitate this
learning, we developed RealBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that
automatically incorporates a wide spectrum of hybrid texts produced through
various human-AI collaboration processes. Our method improves performance in
hybrid text detection tasks and significantly enhances robustness and
generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios, particularly in few-shot
learning conditions, further demonstrating the promise of training-based
approaches in OOD settings. Our code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/heyongxin233/DETree.

Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), LLM agents capable of
autonomous reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks have become a
frontier in artificial intelligence. However, how to translate the research on
general agents into productivity that drives industry transformations remains a
significant challenge. To address this, this paper systematically reviews the
technologies, applications, and evaluation methods of industry agents based on
LLMs. Using an industry agent capability maturity framework, it outlines the
evolution of agents in industry applications, from "process execution systems"
to "adaptive social systems." First, we examine the three key technological
pillars that support the advancement of agent capabilities: Memory, Planning,
and Tool Use. We discuss how these technologies evolve from supporting simple
tasks in their early forms to enabling complex autonomous systems and
collective intelligence in more advanced forms. Then, we provide an overview of
the application of industry agents in real-world domains such as digital
engineering, scientific discovery, embodied intelligence, collaborative
business execution, and complex system simulation. Additionally, this paper
reviews the evaluation benchmarks and methods for both fundamental and
specialized capabilities, identifying the challenges existing evaluation
systems face regarding authenticity, safety, and industry specificity. Finally,
we focus on the practical challenges faced by industry agents, exploring their
capability boundaries, developmental potential, and governance issues in
various scenarios, while providing insights into future directions. By
combining technological evolution with industry practices, this review aims to
clarify the current state and offer a clear roadmap and theoretical foundation
for understanding and building the next generation of industry agents.

*Zihan Liu,Shun Zheng,Xumeng Wen,Yang Wang,Jiang Bian,Mao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning (DSER)概率框架，通过并行运行多个长时程自演化过程，即使验证和修正能力较弱，也能显著扩展开放权重模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证-精炼框架依赖强大的验证和修正能力，这在开放权重的小规模模型中很脆弱。需要一种方法能在弱验证能力下仍能有效扩展推理极限。

Method: 将迭代推理建模为马尔可夫链，每个步骤代表解空间的随机转移。只要改进概率略高于退化概率，就能保证收敛到正确解。通过并行运行多个自演化过程来放大这些小的正向趋势。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B模型上应用DSER，在AIME 2024-2025基准测试中解决了9个之前无法解决的问题中的5个，通过多数投票使这个紧凑模型超越了其600B参数教师的单轮准确率。

Conclusion: DSER不仅提供了测试时扩展的实用价值，还诊断了当前开放权重推理器的基本限制，为开发具有强大内在自演化能力的新一代模型确立了明确的研究议程。

Abstract: Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning has become a cornerstone of advanced
reasoning in large language models. While recent verification-refinement
frameworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems,
their effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction
capabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This
work demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities
on hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially
extended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning
(DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step
represents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is
that convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability
of improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple
long-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small
positive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct
answers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On
the challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously
unsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model
to surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through
majority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER
framework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight
reasoners. By clearly delineating their shortcomings in self-verification,
refinement, and stability, our findings establish a clear research agenda for
developing next-generation models with powerful, intrinsic self-evolving
capabilities.

Motivation: 虽然BERT在单语句子嵌入学习方面很有效，但基于BERT的跨语言句子嵌入尚未被充分探索。本文旨在研究如何学习高质量的多语言句子嵌入。

Method: 结合了掩码语言建模(MLM)、翻译语言建模(TLM)、双编码器翻译排序和加性边际softmax等方法，利用预训练的多语言语言模型。

Result: 将并行训练数据需求减少了80%，在Tatoeba数据集上对112种语言达到83.7%的双文本检索准确率，显著优于LASER的65.5%。同时保持了在单语迁移学习基准上的竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功实现了高质量的多语言句子嵌入，发布了支持109+种语言的模型，并且从CommonCrawl挖掘的并行数据可以训练出有竞争力的神经机器翻译模型。

Abstract: While BERT is an effective method for learning monolingual sentence
embeddings for semantic similarity and embedding based transfer learning BERT
based cross-lingual sentence embeddings have yet to be explored. We
systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence
embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and
cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM),
translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and
additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual
language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data
required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these
methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over
112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5 achieved by LASER, while still
performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks. Parallel
data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train competitive
NMT models for en-zh and en-de. We publicly release our best multilingual
sentence embedding model for 109+ languages at https://tfhub.dev/google/LaBSE.

TL;DR: 提出了EliCal框架，通过两阶段方法实现LLMs的诚实对齐：先使用廉价的自我一致性监督来激发内部置信度，然后用少量正确性标注进行校准，显著减少标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有诚实对齐方法要么依赖无训练的置信度估计，要么需要大规模正确性标注进行训练校准，成本高昂。需要一种标注高效的训练方法来实现通用诚实对齐。

Method: EliCal两阶段框架：1）使用自我一致性监督激发内部置信度；2）用少量正确性标注校准置信度。同时发布了HonestyBench基准，包含10个自由形式QA数据集。

Result: EliCal仅用1k正确性标注（全监督的0.18%）就实现了接近最优的对齐效果，在未见过的MMLU任务上比仅校准基线表现更好。

Conclusion: EliCal为LLMs的通用诚实对齐提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，显著降低了标注成本。

Abstract: Honesty alignment-the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize
their knowledge boundaries and express calibrated confidence-is essential for
trustworthy deployment. Existing methods either rely on training-free
confidence estimation (e.g., token probabilities, self-consistency) or
training-based calibration with correctness annotations. While effective,
achieving universal honesty alignment with training-based calibration requires
costly, large-scale labeling. To support annotation-efficient training, we
introduce Elicitation-Then-Calibration (EliCal), a two-stage framework that
first elicits internal confidence using inexpensive self-consistency
supervision, then calibrates this confidence with a small set of correctness
annotations. To support a large-scale study, we release HonestyBench, a
benchmark covering ten free-form QA datasets with 560k training and 70k
evaluation instances annotated with correctness and self-consistency signals.
Experiments show that EliCal achieves near-optimal alignment with only 1k
correctness annotations (0.18% of full supervision) and better alignment
performance on unseen MMLU tasks than the calibration-only baseline, offering a
scalable solution toward universal honesty alignment in LLMs.

TL;DR: SimBench是首个大规模、标准化的LLM模拟人类行为基准测试，涵盖20个多样化数据集，评估LLM在模拟人类行为方面的表现。


<details>

Motivation: 当前LLM模拟人类行为的评估方法分散且不统一，需要标准化的基准测试来推动LLM模拟能力的科学发展。

Method: 整合20个多样化数据集，涵盖道德决策、经济选择等任务，建立统一的评估框架来测试不同LLM的模拟能力。

Result: 当前最佳LLM的模拟能力有限（40.80/100），性能随模型规模呈对数线性增长，指令调优在低熵问题上提升性能但在高熵问题上降低性能，模型在模拟特定人口群体时表现较差。

Conclusion: 模拟能力与深度知识推理能力高度相关，SimBench为开发更准确的LLM模拟器提供了可衡量的进展标准。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential
to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they
faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented,
based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable
results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale,
standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By
unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to
economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the
necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM
simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have
limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly
with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased
inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off:
instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions
but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle
when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that
simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive
reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to
accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在生物医学NLP中表现良好，但缺乏对高风险决策支持至关重要的结构化推理能力，需要开发既准确又可解释的模型来处理异质临床数据。

Method: 使用多任务学习框架，联合执行二元生存分类、连续生存时间回归和自然语言理由生成。评估三种对齐策略：标准监督微调、思维链提示和GRPO强化学习。

Result: 思维链提示将F1提高+6.0%，MAE降低12%；GRPO在BLEU、ROUGE和BERTScore上实现了最先进的可解释性和预测性能。现有生物医学LLM由于架构限制常无法产生有效推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在多任务临床建模中推理感知对齐的重要性，为精准肿瘤学中可解释、可信赖的LLM设立了新基准。

Abstract: Predicting cancer treatment outcomes requires models that are both accurate
and interpretable, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous clinical data.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in biomedical
NLP, they often lack structured reasoning capabilities critical for high-stakes
decision support. We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that
aligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on
the MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary
survival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural
language rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1)
standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs
to expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and
Med42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and
reduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and
predictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. We further show that
existing biomedical LLMs often fail to produce valid reasoning traces due to
architectural constraints. Our findings underscore the importance of
reasoning-aware alignment in multi-task clinical modeling and set a new
benchmark for interpretable, trustworthy LLMs in precision oncology.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用拓扑数据分析工具Mapper来分析语言模型如何内部表示歧义性，发现在微调后嵌入空间会形成模块化、非凸的区域，这些区域与模型预测高度一致，但在歧义数据中与真实标签的对齐度下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标量指标（如准确率）无法捕捉模型如何内部表示歧义性，特别是在人类标注者存在分歧的情况下。需要新的分析视角来理解模型如何处理主观性和歧义性。

Method: 使用拓扑数据分析工具Mapper来分析微调后的RoBERTa-Large模型在MD-Offense数据集上的嵌入空间结构，与传统方法如PCA和UMAP进行比较。

Result: 微调将嵌入空间重构为模块化、非凸的区域，这些区域与模型预测高度一致（98%的连通组件预测纯度≥90%），但在歧义数据中与真实标签的对齐度下降，揭示了结构置信度与标签不确定性之间的隐藏张力。

Conclusion: Mapper是一个强大的诊断工具，能够直接揭示决策区域、边界塌陷和过度自信的聚类，为理解模型如何解决歧义性提供了新的视角，并可能为主观NLP任务中的主动建模策略提供拓扑指标。

Abstract: Language models are often evaluated with scalar metrics like accuracy, but
such measures fail to capture how models internally represent ambiguity,
especially when human annotators disagree. We propose a topological perspective
to analyze how fine-tuned models encode ambiguity and more generally instances.
  Applied to RoBERTa-Large on the MD-Offense dataset, Mapper, a tool from
topological data analysis, reveals that fine-tuning restructures embedding
space into modular, non-convex regions aligned with model predictions, even for
highly ambiguous cases. Over $98\%$ of connected components exhibit $\geq 90\%$
prediction purity, yet alignment with ground-truth labels drops in ambiguous
data, surfacing a hidden tension between structural confidence and label
uncertainty.
  Unlike traditional tools such as PCA or UMAP, Mapper captures this geometry
directly uncovering decision regions, boundary collapses, and overconfident
clusters. Our findings position Mapper as a powerful diagnostic tool for
understanding how models resolve ambiguity. Beyond visualization, it also
enables topological metrics that may inform proactive modeling strategies in
subjective NLP tasks.

Result: 在各种模型上评估，LCG显著减少语言混淆，通常降低一个数量级，且不影响任务性能

Conclusion: LCG是轻量级插件解决方案，有效解决语言混淆问题，代码已开源

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often experience language confusion, which is
the unintended mixing of languages during text generation. Current solutions to
this problem either necessitate model retraining or cannot differentiate
between harmful confusion and acceptable code-switching. This paper introduces
the Language Confusion Gate (LCG), a lightweight, plug-in solution that filters
tokens during decoding without altering the base LLM. The LCG is trained using
norm-adjusted self-distillation to predict appropriate language families and
apply masking only when needed. Our method is based on the findings that
language confusion is infrequent, correct-language tokens are usually among the
top predictions, and output token embedding norms are larger for high-resource
languages, which biases sampling. When evaluated across various models,
including Qwen3, GPT-OSS, Gemma3, Llama3.1, LCG decreases language confusion
significantly, often by an order of magnitude, without negatively impacting
task performance. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有的预训练语言模型在代码任务中表现良好，但未能充分考虑代码内部潜在的高阶数据相关性。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不同程度上提高了预训练语言模型在代码摘要和代码克隆检测任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 引入高阶数据相关性有助于提高模型在代码相关任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are increasingly being applied to
code-related tasks. Although PLMs have achieved good results, they do not take
into account potential high-order data correlations within the code. We propose
three types of high-order correlations in code tokens, i.e. abstract syntax
tree family correlation, lexical correlation, and line correlation. We design a
tokens and hyperedges generator to capture these high-order data correlations.
We improve the architecture of hypergraph neural networks and combine it with
adapter tuning to propose a novel hypergraph-based adapter (HGAdapter) to
fine-tune PLMs. HGAdapter can encode high-order data correlations and is
allowed to be inserted into various PLMs to enhance performance. Experiments
were conducted on several public datasets, including six languages of code
summarization and code clone detection tasks. Our methods improved the
performance of PLMs in datasets to varying degrees. Experimental results
validate the introduction of high-order data correlations that contribute to
improved effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有法律推理计算方法主要依赖通用推理框架，未能全面考察法律推理的细微过程，且研究主要集中在刑事案件，对民事案件的建模不足。

Conclusion: 显式建模法律推理链能够有效增强语言模型的推理能力，LawChain框架在法律分析任务中具有推广价值。

Abstract: Legal reasoning is a fundamental component of legal analysis and
decision-making. Existing computational approaches to legal reasoning
predominantly rely on generic reasoning frameworks such as syllogism and IRAC,
which do not comprehensively examine the nuanced processes that underpin legal
reasoning. Moreover, current research has largely focused on criminal cases,
with insufficient modeling for civil cases. In this work, we present a novel
framework for explicitly modeling legal reasoning in the analysis of Chinese
tort-related civil cases. We first operationalize the legal reasoning processes
used in tort analysis into the LawChain framework. LawChain is a three-module
reasoning framework, with each module consisting of multiple finer-grained
sub-steps. Informed by the LawChain framework, we introduce the task of tort
legal reasoning and construct an evaluation benchmark, LawChain$_{eval}$, to
systematically assess the critical steps within analytical reasoning chains for
tort analysis. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large
language models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our
results indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling
crucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several
baseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning
through prompting or post-training. We conduct further experiments on
additional legal analysis tasks, such as Legal Named-Entity Recognition and
Criminal Damages Calculation, to verify the generalizability of these
baselines. The proposed baseline approaches achieve significant improvements in
tort-related legal reasoning and generalize well to related legal analysis
tasks, thus demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling legal reasoning

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的遗忘学习方法，在保持知识遗忘效果的同时，恢复了模型在提示中重新引入被遗忘知识时的上下文利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遗忘学习方法评估主要关注知识遗忘程度和模型整体性能保持，但忽视了用户可能希望模型在提示中重新引入被遗忘知识时仍能利用该信息的重要使用场景。

Method: 在现有遗忘学习目标基础上增加了一个插件项，专门用于保持模型在被遗忘知识出现在上下文时仍能利用该知识的能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够将上下文效用恢复到接近原始水平，同时仍保持有效的知识遗忘和保留集性能。

Conclusion: 提出的增强遗忘学习方法成功解决了现有方法在上下文效用方面的不足，为更实用的遗忘学习提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models may encode sensitive information or outdated knowledge
that needs to be removed, to ensure responsible and compliant model responses.
Unlearning has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining, aiming
to remove specific knowledge while preserving overall model utility. Existing
evaluations of unlearning methods focus on (1) the extent of forgetting of the
target knowledge (forget set) and (2) maintaining performance on the retain set
(i.e., utility). However, these evaluations overlook an important usability
aspect: users may still want the model to leverage the removed information if
it is re-introduced in the prompt. In a systematic evaluation of six
state-of-the-art unlearning methods, we find that they consistently impair such
contextual utility. To address this, we augment unlearning objectives with a
plug-in term that preserves the model's ability to use forgotten knowledge when
it is present in context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
restores contextual utility to near original levels while still maintaining
effective forgetting and retain-set utility.

Abstract: This paper introduces Qomhr\'a, a bilingual Irish-English large language
model (LLM), developed under low-resource constraints presenting a complete
pipeline spanning bilingual continued pre-training, instruction tuning, and
alignment from human preferences. Newly accessible Irish corpora and English
text are mixed and curated to improve Irish performance while preserving
English ability. 6 closed-weight LLMs are judged for their Irish text
generation by a native speaker, a learner and other LLMs. Google's
Gemini-2.5-Pro is ranked the highest and is subsequently used to synthesise
instruction tuning and human preference datasets. Two datasets are contributed
leveraging Gemini-2.5-Pro: a 30K Irish-English parallel instruction tuning
dataset and a 1K human preference dataset, generating accepted and rejected
responses that show near perfect alignment with a native Irish speaker.
Qomhr\'a is comprehensively evaluated across benchmarks testing translation,
gender understanding, topic identification and world knowledge with gains of up
to 29% in Irish and 44% in English. Qomhr\'a also undergoes instruction tuning
and demonstrates clear progress in instruction following, crucial for chatbot

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QueST框架通过难度感知图采样和拒绝微调生成具有挑战性的编程问题，显著提升语言模型在竞争性编程任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有竞争性编程数据集规模有限（仅数千到数万问题），且依赖人工标注数据，限制了语言模型的可扩展性。需要大规模、具有挑战性的编程问题训练数据来提升模型推理能力。

Method: 提出QueST框架，结合难度感知图采样和难度感知拒绝微调，专门训练生成器来创建具有挑战性的编程问题。使用生成的问题进行知识蒸馏（从强教师模型）或强化学习训练小模型。

Result: QueST生成的挑战性问题质量优于GPT-4o。在100K QueST生成问题上微调的Qwen3-8B-base在LiveCodeBench上超越原版Qwen3-8B。加入额外112K示例后，8B模型性能匹配671B的DeepSeek-R1。

Conclusion: 通过QueST生成复杂问题为推进语言模型在竞争性编程和推理方面的前沿提供了有效且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved strong performance on reasoning tasks,
solving competition-level coding and math problems. However, their scalability
is limited by human-labeled datasets and the lack of large-scale, challenging
coding problem training data. Existing competitive coding datasets contain only
thousands to tens of thousands of problems. Previous synthetic data generation
methods rely on either augmenting existing instruction datasets or selecting
challenging problems from human-labeled data. In this paper, we propose QueST,
a novel framework which combines difficulty-aware graph sampling and
difficulty-aware rejection fine-tuning that directly optimizes specialized
generators to create challenging coding problems. Our trained generators
demonstrate superior capability compared to even GPT-4o at creating challenging
problems that benefit downstream performance. We leverage QueST to generate
large-scale synthetic coding problems, which we then use to distill from strong
teacher models with long chain-of-thought or to conduct reinforcement learning
for smaller models, proving effective in both scenarios. Our distillation
experiments demonstrate significant performance gains. Specifically, after
fine-tuning Qwen3-8B-base on 100K difficult problems generated by QueST, we
surpass the performance of the original Qwen3-8B on LiveCodeBench. With an
additional 112K examples (i.e., 28K human-written problems paired with multiple
synthetic solutions), our 8B model matches the performance of the much larger
DeepSeek-R1-671B. These findings indicate that generating complex problems via
QueST offers an effective and scalable approach to advancing the frontiers of
competitive coding and reasoning for large language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级少样本命名实体识别框架，通过改进的指令调优模板和保留实体信息的策略性数据增强技术，在低资源场景下实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源场景下NER任务面临的标注数据稀缺问题，传统零样本和指令调优方法在领域特定实体上泛化能力不足，且无法有效利用有限可用数据。

Method: 1) 新的指令调优模板，结合先前IT方法原理，利用最新LLM的大上下文窗口；2) 策略性数据增强技术，在保持实体信息的同时对上下文进行改写，扩展训练数据而不损害语义关系。

Result: 在基准数据集上，少样本方法在CrossNER数据集上平均F1得分达80.1；使用改写方法训练的模型比基线版本F1得分提升高达17分。

Conclusion: 该方法为训练数据和计算能力有限的群体提供了有前景的解决方案，在少样本和零样本任务上达到与最先进模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task that requires substantial
annotated data, making it challenging in low-resource scenarios where label
acquisition is expensive. While zero-shot and instruction-tuned approaches have
made progress, they often fail to generalize to domain-specific entities and do
not effectively utilize limited available data. We present a lightweight
few-shot NER framework that addresses these challenges through two key
innovations: (1) a new instruction tuning template with a simplified output
format that combines principles from prior IT approaches to leverage the large
context window of recent state-of-the-art LLMs; (2) introducing a strategic
data augmentation technique that preserves entity information while
paraphrasing the surrounding context, thereby expanding our training data
without compromising semantic relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets
show that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models
on few-shot and zero-shot tasks, with our few-shot approach attaining an
average F1 score of 80.1 on the CrossNER datasets. Models trained with our
paraphrasing approach show consistent improvements in F1 scores of up to 17
points over baseline versions, offering a promising solution for groups with
limited NER training data and compute power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长上下文LLM基准存在上下文长度固定、标注劳动密集以及训练中标签泄露的问题，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 利用arXiv论文构建学术写作任务，整合高质量专家策划的少样本示例，支持灵活上下文长度，并采用实时评估机制防止标签泄露。

Result: 评估显示LLM在具有层次抽象级别的任务上表现不佳，且难以处理长少样本演示，突显了基准的挑战性。

Conclusion: AcademicEval为长上下文建模能力评估提供了有效基准，通过实验分析揭示了增强LLM长上下文建模能力的见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance in
long-context understanding. However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are
limited by rigid context length, labor-intensive annotation, and the pressing
challenge of label leakage issues during LLM training. Therefore, we propose
\textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context
generation tasks. \textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce
several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \textit{i.e.},
\textsc{Title}, \textsc{Abstract}, \textsc{Introduction}, and \textsc{Related
Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual
labeling. Moreover, \textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and
expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to
enable flexible context length. Especially, \textsc{AcademicEval} features an
efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic
evaluation on \textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs
perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to
struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our
benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for
enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用二元检索增强奖励的在线强化学习方法，有效减少语言模型的外源性幻觉，同时保持其他任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在减少语言模型幻觉时往往会导致开放生成和下游任务性能下降，限制了实际应用价值。

Method: 使用二元检索增强奖励的在线强化学习，只有当模型输出完全正确时才给予奖励1，否则为0。

Result: 在开放生成中幻觉率降低39.3%；在问答任务中学会策略性弃答，PopQA和GPQA的错误答案分别减少44.4%和21.7%；且不影响指令遵循、数学和代码能力。

Conclusion: 二元奖励方法在提高事实准确性的同时避免了性能退化，优于连续奖励强化学习方案。

Abstract: Language models often generate factually incorrect information unsupported by
their training data, a phenomenon known as extrinsic hallucination. Existing
mitigation approaches often degrade performance on open-ended generation and
downstream tasks, limiting their practical utility. We propose an online
reinforcement learning method using a novel binary retrieval-augmented reward
(RAR) to address this tradeoff. Unlike continuous reward schemes, our approach
assigns a reward of one only when the model's output is entirely factually
correct, and zero otherwise. We evaluate our method on Qwen3 reasoning models
across diverse tasks. For open-ended generation, binary RAR achieves a 39.3%
reduction in hallucination rates, substantially outperforming both supervised
training and continuous-reward RL baselines. In short-form question answering,
the model learns calibrated abstention, strategically outputting "I don't know"
when faced with insufficient parametric knowledge. This yields 44.4% and 21.7%
fewer incorrect answers on PopQA and GPQA, respectively. Crucially, these
factuality gains come without performance degradation on instruction following,
math, or code, whereas continuous-reward RL, despite improving factuality,
induces quality regressions.

Motivation: 医学大语言模型在标准基准测试中表现优异，但这些结果如何转化为临床工作流程中的安全可靠性能仍具挑战性，需要更贴近实际临床使用的评估框架。

Method: 采用自主性层级框架（L0-L3），涵盖信息工具、信息转换与聚合、决策支持和监督代理四个级别，将现有基准和指标与各层级的允许操作和风险进行对齐。

Result: 提出了基于层级的评估蓝图，用于选择指标、收集证据和报告声明，并将评估与监管联系起来，使评估目标更加明确。

Conclusion: 通过以自主性为核心，该调查推动领域超越基于分数的声明，转向为真实临床使用提供可信、风险感知的证据。

Abstract: Medical Large language models achieve strong scores on standard benchmarks;
however, the transfer of those results to safe and reliable performance in
clinical workflows remains a challenge. This survey reframes evaluation through
a levels-of-autonomy lens (L0-L3), spanning informational tools, information
transformation and aggregation, decision support, and supervised agents. We
align existing benchmarks and metrics with the actions permitted at each level
and their associated risks, making the evaluation targets explicit. This
motivates a level-conditioned blueprint for selecting metrics, assembling
evidence, and reporting claims, alongside directions that link evaluation to
oversight. By centering autonomy, the survey moves the field beyond score-based
claims toward credible, risk-aware evidence for real clinical use.

Conclusion: 大规模数据驱动方法能够训练出高效的评估器，FARE在多个评估任务中表现出色，可作为推理时重排序器和强化学习训练中的验证器。

Abstract: Finetuning specialized generative evaluators has emerged as a popular
paradigm to meet the increasing demand for scalable evaluation during both
training and test-time. However, recent work has largely focused on applying
new methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators,
shying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus
on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation
tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification,
and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With
our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family
of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative
rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges
larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for
open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static
benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers,
FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training,
FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs.
string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned
FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.

Result: 在三个智能体框架和两种不同LLM上集成xKG后，在PaperBench上显示出显著的性能提升(使用o3-mini时提升10.9%)

Conclusion: xKG被证明是自动化AI研究复现的通用且可扩展解决方案

Abstract: Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language
model (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable
code, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent
technical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches
tend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured
knowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a
modular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical
insights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from
scientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two
different LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on
PaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible
solution for automated AI research replication. Code will released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能城市基础设施监控需求增长，人工检查成本高且危险，现有自动系统通常只处理单一缺陷类型或输出非结构化结果

Method: 使用YOLO系列目标检测器进行多缺陷检测和分割，然后将检测结果传递给视觉语言模型进行场景感知总结，生成JSON格式的结构化行动计划

Result: 在公共数据集和捕获的CCTV片段上的实验评估表明，系统能准确识别多种缺陷并生成连贯的总结

Conclusion: 讨论了将系统扩展到城市范围部署的挑战和方向

Abstract: Infrastructure in smart cities is increasingly monitored by networks of
closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Roads, bridges and tunnels develop
cracks, potholes, and fluid leaks that threaten public safety and require
timely repair. Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing
automatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide
unstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper
proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi
defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and
passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware
summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that
includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans,
and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection,
highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and
LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation
on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system
accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We
conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city
wide deployments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于视觉语言模型的视频异常检测方法计算成本高和视觉定位性能不稳定的问题，实现实时部署。

Method: 采用两阶段级联系统：离线学习正常行为规则，在线推理时结合轻量级过滤和细粒度VLM推理；使用运动掩码提示引导VLM注意力，基于规则偏差检测识别异常。

Result: 在四个数据集上平均达到57.68 fps（151.79倍加速），97.2%的准确率，与最先进的VLM-based VAD方法相当。

Conclusion: Cerberus是实时视频分析的实际解决方案，在保持高准确率的同时显著提升推理速度。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot
detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual
grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for
efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules
offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning
during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key
innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The
former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the
latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than
enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show
that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a
151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art
VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time
video analytics.

Motivation: 现有视频理解模型依赖大量标注数据和任务特定训练，成本高且可扩展性有限。大型视觉语言模型在静态图像上的零样本推理能力尚未完全转化到视频领域。

Method: 使用预训练VLM的冻结视觉编码器将视频流转换为语义特征轨迹，然后使用核时间分割(KTS)将连续特征流分割为语义连贯的事件片段，最后通过无监督密度聚类识别重复出现的宏观场景和主题。

Result: 该方法能够自动生成视频内容的结构化多模态摘要，为视频内容提供零样本自动结构分析的有效途径。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种有效、可解释且模型无关的零样本视频内容自动结构分析方法，无需端到端训练。

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual
Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the
video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive,
task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and
limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework
for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically
combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine
learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video
understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a
high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms
a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual
encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal
Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the
continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.
These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to
identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By
selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging
the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework
automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.
This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway

### [107] [Res-Bench: Benchmarking the Robustness of Multimodal Large Language Models to Dynamic Resolution Input](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16926)
*Chenxu Li,Zhicai Wang,Yuan Sheng,Xingyu Zhu,Yanbin Hao,Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Res-Bench基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在不同输入分辨率下的性能稳定性，包含14,400个样本和12个分辨率级别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法主要关注语义性能，忽略了分辨率鲁棒性——即在不同输入分辨率下性能是否保持稳定。

Method: 设计了包含Spearman相关性和绝对/相对连续误差等鲁棒性指标的新评估框架，对领先的MLLMs进行大规模评估。

Result: 评估分析了模型中心和任务中心的鲁棒性、预处理策略（填充和超分辨率）以及微调对稳定性的影响。

Conclusion: Res-Bench填补了MLLMs分辨率鲁棒性评估的空白，为模型开发提供了重要的基准工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly support dynamic image
resolutions. However, current evaluation paradigms primarily assess semantic
performance, overlooking the critical question of resolution robustness -
whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address
this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising
14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions.
We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy
metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple
robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance
trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring
performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale
evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and
task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing
strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of
fine-tuning for stability enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了多模态大语言模型的三阶段跨模态交互过程，并提出VisiPruner训练无关剪枝框架，显著减少视觉相关注意力计算和FLOPs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但由于多模态token数量的二次增长导致计算开销巨大。现有token剪枝方法缺乏对MLLMs如何处理和融合多模态信息的基本理解。

Method: 通过系统分析发现三阶段跨模态交互过程：(1)浅层识别任务意图，视觉token作为被动注意力汇聚点；(2)中层发生跨模态融合，由少数关键视觉token驱动；(3)深层丢弃视觉token，专注于语言精炼。基于此提出VisiPruner训练无关剪枝框架。

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5 7B上减少高达99%的视觉相关注意力计算和53.9%的FLOPs，显著优于现有token剪枝方法，并在各种MLLMs上具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 除了剪枝外，研究见解为训练高效MLLMs提供了可操作指南，通过使模型架构与其内在的层间处理动态对齐来提高效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance
across vision-language tasks, but suffer from significant computational
overhead due to the quadratic growth of attention computations with the number
of multimodal tokens. Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs,
\textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse
multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a
\textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers
recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks;
(2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few
critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely
on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose
\emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of
vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It
significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across
diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable
guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its
intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraCUA是一个基础模型，通过混合动作将GUI原语与高级程序化工具调用无缝集成，解决了计算机使用代理的性能瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计算机使用代理仅依赖原始动作（点击、输入、滚动），这需要精确的视觉定位和冗长的执行链，导致级联失败和性能瓶颈。

Method: 采用四组件方法：自动管道从软件文档扩展程序化工具；合成数据引擎生成可验证任务；大规模高质量混合动作轨迹收集；两阶段训练管道结合监督微调和在线强化学习。

Result: 7B和32B模型在OSWorld上相对基础模型平均提升22%，步骤减少11%；在WindowsAgentArena上达到21.7%成功率，优于基于Windows数据训练的基线。

Conclusion: 混合动作机制对减少错误传播和保持执行效率至关重要，UltraCUA在计算机使用代理领域实现了显著改进。

Abstract: Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions
(click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy
execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.
While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers,
tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We
present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid
action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic
tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an
automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,
open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine
producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use
scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection
with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online
reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and
high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate
substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA
models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while
being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on
WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming
baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical,
reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.

TL;DR: Glyph框架通过将长文本渲染为图像，利用视觉语言模型处理，实现3-4倍文本压缩，在保持准确性的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型处理长上下文时面临的计算和内存成本过高的问题，传统token扩展方法在百万token级别变得不切实际。

Method: 提出Glyph框架：将长文本渲染为图像，使用视觉语言模型处理；设计基于LLM的遗传搜索算法优化视觉渲染配置，平衡准确性和压缩率。

Result: 在多个长上下文基准测试中达到3-4倍token压缩，准确性可与Qwen3-8B等领先LLMs媲美；预填充和解码速度提升约4倍，SFT训练速度提升约2倍；128K上下文VLM可扩展处理1M token级别任务。

Conclusion: 视觉上下文缩放是解决长上下文建模挑战的有效方法，Glyph框架在保持性能的同时显著提升效率，并为文档理解等多模态任务带来额外优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for
tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning.
However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive
computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs.
In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle
this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a
framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with
vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual
input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an
LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations
for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining
accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context
benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and
decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme
compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text
tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal
tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at
https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数美国人（66%）从未使用过ChatGPT等聊天LLM，但LLM开发主要依赖用户数据，导致忽视了非用户群体的需求和任务，可能加剧技术不平等。

Method: 通过与非用户进行案例研究，分析其需求与现有用户的差异，探索非用户需求指向的新型推理任务，并提出基于人本方法系统整合非用户需求的方法。

Result: 研究发现非用户的需求与当前用户存在显著差异，非用户需求指向了新型推理任务，通过人本方法可以系统性地整合这些需求。

Conclusion: 在LLM开发中必须纳入非用户视角，否则会错失重要任务需求、加剧不平等，并导致模型开发和评估的盲点。

Abstract: Although language model-based chat systems are increasingly used in daily
life, most Americans remain non-adopters of chat-based LLMs -- as of June 2025,
66% had never used ChatGPT. At the same time, LLM development and evaluation
rely mainly on data from adopters (e.g., logs, preference data), focusing on
the needs and tasks for a limited demographic group of adopters in terms of
geographic location, education, and gender. In this position paper, we argue
that incorporating non-adopter perspectives is essential for developing broadly
useful and capable LLMs. We contend that relying on methods that focus
primarily on adopters will risk missing a range of tasks and needs prioritized
by non-adopters, entrenching inequalities in who benefits from LLMs, and
creating oversights in model development and evaluation. To illustrate this
claim, we conduct case studies with non-adopters and show: how non-adopter
needs diverge from those of current users, how non-adopter needs point us
towards novel reasoning tasks, and how to systematically integrate non-adopter
needs via human-centered methods.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了PrivacyPAD框架，使用强化学习动态路由文本块，在保护隐私和任务性能之间实现最优平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户向大语言模型提交查询时面临两难选择：使用强大的专有模型但可能泄露敏感数据，或使用本地小模型保护隐私但性能下降。现有方法破坏了语言连贯性且无差别地移除隐私信息。

Method: 将隐私保护委托问题重构为序列决策问题，引入强化学习框架PrivacyPAD，训练智能体动态路由文本块，学习区分可替换PII和任务关键PII的策略。

Result: 在隐私-效用前沿上达到新的最先进水平，验证了在敏感环境中部署LLM时需要学习自适应策略的必要性。

Conclusion: PrivacyPAD框架通过动态路由策略有效平衡了隐私保护和任务性能，为敏感环境中的LLM部署提供了解决方案。

Abstract: When users submit queries to Large Language Models (LLMs), their prompts can
often contain sensitive data, forcing a difficult choice: Send the query to a
powerful proprietary LLM providers to achieving state-of-the-art performance
and risk data exposure, or relying on smaller, local models guarantees data
privacy but often results in a degradation of task performance. Prior
approaches have relied on static pipelines that use LLM rewriting, which
shatters linguistic coherence and indiscriminately removes privacy-sensitive
information, including task-critical content. We reformulate this challenge
(Privacy-Conscious Delegation) as a sequential decision-making problem and
introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework called PrivacyPAD to
solve it. Our framework trains an agent to dynamically route text chunks,
learning a policy that optimally balances the trade-off between privacy leakage
and task performance. It implicitly distinguishes between replaceable
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (which it shields locally) and
task-critical PII (which it strategically sends to the remote model for maximal
utility). To validate our approach in complex scenarios, we also introduce a
new medical dataset with high PII density. Our framework achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the privacy-utility frontier, demonstrating the necessity
of learned, adaptive policies for deploying LLMs in sensitive environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对生成式和判别式分类器在成员推理攻击中的系统性比较有限，本文旨在填补这一空白，从理论和实证角度分析两者的隐私风险差异。

Method: 通过理论分析生成式分类器易受攻击的原因，并在9个基准数据集上对判别式、生成式和伪生成式文本分类器进行全面的实证评估，使用多种MIA策略。

Result: 完全生成式分类器（显式建模P(X,Y)）对成员推理攻击最为脆弱，其标准推理方法显著放大了隐私风险，且在不同训练数据量下结果一致。

Conclusion: 生成式分类器存在固有的效用-隐私权衡，在隐私敏感应用中需谨慎部署，未来需开发既能保持效用又能缓解成员推理漏洞的隐私保护生成式分类器。

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) pose a critical privacy threat by
enabling adversaries to determine whether a specific sample was included in a
model's training dataset. Despite extensive research on MIAs, systematic
comparisons between generative and discriminative classifiers remain limited.
This work addresses this gap by first providing theoretical motivation for why
generative classifiers exhibit heightened susceptibility to MIAs, then
validating these insights through comprehensive empirical evaluation. Our study
encompasses discriminative, generative, and pseudo-generative text classifiers
across varying training data volumes, evaluated on nine benchmark datasets.
Employing a diverse array of MIA strategies, we consistently demonstrate that
fully generative classifiers which explicitly model the joint likelihood
$P(X,Y)$ are most vulnerable to membership leakage. Furthermore, we observe
that the canonical inference approach commonly used in generative classifiers
significantly amplifies this privacy risk. These findings reveal a fundamental
utility-privacy trade-off inherent in classifier design, underscoring the
critical need for caution when deploying generative classifiers in
privacy-sensitive applications. Our results motivate future research directions
in developing privacy-preserving generative classifiers that can maintain
utility while mitigating membership inference vulnerabilities.

Main category: cs.CR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前参数高效微调模型的发布实践缺乏对所用数据和更新计算方式的可靠保证，存在信任缺口，特别是在受监管和去中心化部署场景中。

Method: 结合五个关键要素：数据集清单承诺、可验证采样器、参数高效微调更新电路、递归证明聚合、来源绑定和可信执行属性卡。

Result: 在英语和双语指令混合数据集上，该方法在严格预算内保持了模型性能，实现了实用的证明性能，策略配额零违规，私有采样无索引泄露。

Conclusion: 端到端可验证微调对于真实参数高效流水线是可行的，为受监管和去中心化部署填补了关键信任缺口。

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted through parameter efficient fine
tuning, but current release practices provide weak assurances about what data
were used and how updates were computed. We present Verifiable Fine Tuning, a
protocol and system that produces succinct zero knowledge proofs that a
released model was obtained from a public initialization under a declared
training program and an auditable dataset commitment. The approach combines
five elements. First, commitments that bind data sources, preprocessing,
licenses, and per epoch quota counters to a manifest. Second, a verifiable
sampler that supports public replayable and private index hiding batch
selection. Third, update circuits restricted to parameter efficient fine tuning
that enforce AdamW style optimizer semantics and proof friendly approximations
with explicit error budgets. Fourth, recursive aggregation that folds per step
proofs into per epoch and end to end certificates with millisecond
verification. Fifth, provenance binding and optional trusted execution property
cards that attest code identity and constants. On English and bilingual
instruction mixtures, the method maintains utility within tight budgets while
achieving practical proof performance. Policy quotas are enforced with zero
violations, and private sampling windows show no measurable index leakage.
Federated experiments demonstrate that the system composes with probabilistic
audits and bandwidth constraints. These results indicate that end to end
verifiable fine tuning is feasible today for real parameter efficient
pipelines, closing a critical trust gap for regulated and decentralized
deployments.

*Masahiro Kaneko,Timothy Baldwin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一个信息论框架来量化LLM对抗攻击中的信息泄露，揭示了观察信号与目标属性之间的互信息决定了攻击成本，实验表明不同信息暴露程度显著影响攻击效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全威胁中，恶意用户通过对抗指令推断未知目标属性，但信息泄露程度缺乏理论指导，审计者和防御者难以权衡透明度与风险。

Method: 建立信息论框架，以观察信号Z与目标属性T的互信息I(Z;T)作为每查询泄露比特，分析达到误差ε所需的最小查询数。

Result: 实验在7个LLM上进行系统提示泄露、越狱和重新学习攻击，结果显示：仅暴露答案token需约千次查询，添加logits降至百次，暴露完整思考过程仅需几十次。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM部署中的透明度与安全平衡提供了首个理论基准，证明适度增加信息披露会使攻击成本从二次方降至对数级。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks by malicious users that threaten the safety of large
language models (LLMs) can be viewed as attempts to infer a target property $T$
that is unknown when an instruction is issued, and becomes knowable only after
the model's reply is observed. Examples of target properties $T$ include the
binary flag that triggers an LLM's harmful response or rejection, and the
degree to which information deleted by unlearning can be restored, both
elicited via adversarial instructions. The LLM reveals an \emph{observable
signal} $Z$ that potentially leaks hints for attacking through a response
containing answer tokens, thinking process tokens, or logits. Yet the scale of
information leaked remains anecdotal, leaving auditors without principled
guidance and defenders blind to the transparency--risk trade-off. We fill this
gap with an information-theoretic framework that computes how much information
can be safely disclosed, and enables auditors to gauge how close their methods
come to the fundamental limit. Treating the mutual information $I(Z;T)$ between
the observation $Z$ and the target property $T$ as the leaked bits per query,
we show that achieving error $\varepsilon$ requires at least
$\log(1/\varepsilon)/I(Z;T)$ queries, scaling linearly with the inverse leak
rate and only logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Thus, even a modest
increase in disclosure collapses the attack cost from quadratic to logarithmic
in terms of the desired accuracy. Experiments on seven LLMs across
system-prompt leakage, jailbreak, and relearning attacks corroborate the
theory: exposing answer tokens alone requires about a thousand queries; adding
logits cuts this to about a hundred; and revealing the full thinking process
trims it to a few dozen. Our results provide the first principled yardstick for
balancing transparency and security when deploying LLMs.

TL;DR: VERA-V是一个变分推理框架，通过将多模态越狱发现重新定义为学习配对文本-图像提示的联合后验分布，生成隐蔽的对抗性输入来绕过模型防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态红队方法依赖脆弱的模板，专注于单攻击设置，仅暴露有限的漏洞子集，需要更全面的漏洞发现方法。

Method: 使用变分推理框架学习文本-图像提示的联合后验分布，训练轻量级攻击器近似后验，结合排版文本提示、扩散图像合成和结构化干扰三种策略。

Result: 在HarmBench和HADES基准测试中，VERA-V在开源和前沿VLM上始终优于最先进基线，在GPT-4o上攻击成功率比最佳基线高出53.75%。

Conclusion: VERA-V通过概率方法有效发现多模态漏洞，为理解和防御VLM安全风险提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend large language models with visual
reasoning, but their multimodal design also introduces new, underexplored
vulnerabilities. Existing multimodal red-teaming methods largely rely on
brittle templates, focus on single-attack settings, and expose only a narrow
subset of vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VERA-V, a
variational inference framework that recasts multimodal jailbreak discovery as
learning a joint posterior distribution over paired text-image prompts. This
probabilistic view enables the generation of stealthy, coupled adversarial
inputs that bypass model guardrails. We train a lightweight attacker to
approximate the posterior, allowing efficient sampling of diverse jailbreaks
and providing distributional insights into vulnerabilities. VERA-V further
integrates three complementary strategies: (i) typography-based text prompts
that embed harmful cues, (ii) diffusion-based image synthesis that introduces
adversarial signals, and (iii) structured distractors to fragment VLM
attention. Experiments on HarmBench and HADES benchmarks show that VERA-V
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both open-source and
frontier VLMs, achieving up to 53.75% higher attack success rate (ASR) over the
best baseline on GPT-4o.

Motivation: 参数高效微调技术虽然重要，但在时间投入和运营成本方面存在效率低下的挑战，特别是微调过程中出现的Shadowy Sparsity问题尚未得到充分解决。

Method: Long Exposure系统包含三个关键组件：Shadowy-sparsity Exposer使用长感知范围捕捉更多稀疏细节；Sequence-oriented Predictor处理大序列输入和动态变化的参数；Dynamic-aware Operator优化计算模式和内存访问。

Result: 广泛评估表明，Long Exposure在端到端微调中实现了最高2.49倍的加速，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Long Exposure为加速LLMs的参数高效微调提供了有前景的进展，有效解决了Shadowy Sparsity带来的效率挑战。

Abstract: The adaptation of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to diverse
downstream tasks via fine-tuning is critical for numerous applications.
However, the inefficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques
presents significant challenges in terms of time investments and operational
costs. In this paper, we first introduce a nuanced form of sparsity, termed
Shadowy Sparsity, which is distinctive in fine-tuning and has not been
adequately addressed for acceleration. Under Shadowy Sparsity, we propose Long
Exposure, an efficient system to accelerate PEFT for LLMs. Long Exposure
comprises three key components: Shadowy-sparsity Exposer employs a prolonged
sensing range to capture more sparsity details under shadowy sparsity;
Sequence-oriented Predictor provides efficient yet accurate predictions to
handle large sequence inputs and constantly-evolving parameters; and
Dynamic-aware Operator facilitates more structured computational patterns and
coalesced memory accesses, addressing dynamic sparse operations. Extensive
evaluations show that Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a
$2.49\times$ speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning, offering promising advancements
in accelerating PEFT for LLMs.

Result: 在广泛实验中，PALE显著优于基线方法6.55%

Conclusion: PALE框架在无需人工标注的情况下实现了优越的幻觉检测性能，具有良好的泛化性和实用性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest in AI
community. Despite their impressive generation capabilities, they have been
found to produce misleading or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as
hallucinations. Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to
ensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in
hallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing
both truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce
Prompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework
that leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for
hallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and
hallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more
effectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings
produced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive
Mahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions
of truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a
matrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying
structure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require
additional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality
for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE
achieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the
competitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO算法驱动的RLVR方法在提升LLM推理能力方面存在局限性，只能强化预训练偏差而无法发现全新解决方案，其泛化能力取决于目标任务与预训练偏好的对齐程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GRPO算法在不同推理领域表现不一致的原因，探索其在什么条件下能改善推理能力和实现分布外泛化。

Method: 从数据分布角度进行理论分析，证明GRPO是一种保守的重新加权方案；通过从头训练transformer进行受控实验，评估在推理深度、输入长度、token表示和组合性等方面的泛化能力。

Result: GRPO的分布外改进仅当目标任务与模型预训练偏好对齐时出现，而在分布内任务上的收益随着性能饱和而减少。

Conclusion: GRPO不是通用的推理增强器，而是强化预训练偏好的工具，未来需要开发能扩展模型能力超越预训练起源的算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), primarily driven by
the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, is a leading approach
for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
its wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model
may show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet
remain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a
critical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and
generalize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data
distribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a
conservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and
thus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in
carefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch,
evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token
representation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled
explanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target
task aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution
(ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a
universal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases.
Our findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a
model's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin.

### [120] [Zeroth-Order Sharpness-Aware Learning with Exponential Tilting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16157)
*Xuchen Gong,Tian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于指数倾斜目标的零阶优化方法，通过平滑过渡平均损失和最大损失公式，将零阶优化与锐度感知最小化(SAM)方法连接起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统零阶优化方法优化平滑后的原始函数，即随机扰动模型参数下的期望目标，而SAM方法关注邻域内的最大损失以获得平坦最小值。本文旨在明确连接这两种方法。

Method: 提出指数倾斜目标，通过倾斜参数t在平均损失和最大损失公式之间提供平滑过渡，开发新的零阶算法来解决软SAM目标。

Result: 精确刻画了倾斜SAM框架的锐度概念，在分类、多项选择问答和语言生成等下游任务中，相比传统零阶基线方法实现了更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为SAM变体的无梯度和内存高效替代方案，在多种任务上展现出优于传统零阶方法的泛化能力。

Abstract: Classic zeroth-order optimization approaches typically optimize for a
smoothed version of the original function, i.e., the expected objective under
randomly perturbed model parameters. This can be interpreted as encouraging the
loss values in the perturbation set to be small on average. Popular
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objectives, however, typically focus on the
largest loss within the neighborhood to arrive at flat minima more effectively.
In this work, we connect zeroth-order optimization (and its corresponding
objectives) with SAM approaches explicitly, through an exponential tilting
objective that provides a smooth transition between the average- and the
max-loss formulations. We explore new zeroth-order algorithms to solve a soft
SAM objective parameterized by a tilting parameter $t$. We provide precise
characterizations of the sharpness notions of the tilted SAM framework.
Practically, our approach can be used as a gradient-free and memory-efficient
alternative to SAM variants, and it achieves better generalization compared to
vanilla zeroth-order baselines on a wide range of downstream tasks, including
classification, multiple choice QA, and language generation.

### [121] [Alignment is Localized: A Causal Probe into Preference Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16167)
*Archie Chaudhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过层间因果补丁分析发现，语言模型的对齐过程是空间局部化的，主要发生在中间层，而非扩散的参数化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）已成为语言模型对齐的流行方法，但其内部工作机制仍不透明，需要系统分析对齐过程的具体实现方式。

Method: 在Llama-3.2-1B模型上应用层间因果补丁技术，分析基础模型与其调优版本在人类偏好对上的差异，并使用LASSO回归识别关键层。

Result: 发现对齐是空间局部化的：中间层激活编码了决定奖励一致行为的独特子空间，而早期和晚期层基本不受影响；只有少数层具有非零系数连接激活距离与奖励增益。

Conclusion: 基于人类偏好的语言模型对齐是一个方向性的低秩过程，而非扩散的参数化过程。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning frameworks, particularly those utilizing human
annotations, have become an increasingly popular method for preference
fine-tuning, where the outputs of a language model are tuned to match a certain
set of behavioral policies or guidelines. Reinforcement Learning through Human
Feedback (RLHF) is perhaps the most popular implementation of such a framework,
particularly for aligning LMs toward safety and human intent. However, the
internal workings of how such alignment is achieved remain largely opaque. In
this work, we systematically analyze preference optimization for language model
alignment by applying layer-wide causal patching between a base model and its
tuned counterpart across human preference pairs. We implement our methodology
on \textit{Llama-3.2-1B}, and find that alignment is spatially localized:
mid-layer activations encode a distinct subspace that causally determines
reward-consistent behavior, while early and late layers remain largely
unaffected. Utilizing LASSO regression, we also find that only a small number
of layers possess non-zero coefficients linking activation distances to reward
gains. Overall, we show that, at least for some language models, alignment from
human-based, preferential tuning is a directional, low rank process, rather
than diffuse and parameteric.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WEBSERV是一个用于训练和评估强化学习网页代理的可扩展环境，解决了现有环境中上下文噪声大、动作执行不确定性和扩展性差的问题，在WebArena任务上取得了最先进的成功率，同时大幅降低了启动延迟和存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习网页代理环境存在以下问题：向策略模型提供过多噪声上下文、动作执行不等待UI或网络稳定、无法有效扩展隔离的客户端-服务器容器进行并行RL训练。需要构建一个既能提供真实浏览器交互又能控制服务器端状态的可扩展环境。

Method: 提出WEBSERV环境，包含：1）紧凑、站点无关的浏览器环境，平衡上下文和动作复杂性；2）通过高效启动和重置web服务器实现可扩展的RL环境，支持大规模RL训练和评估。

Result: 在WebArena的购物CMS和Gitlab任务上实现了最先进的单提示成功率，同时将启动延迟降低约5倍，存储需求减少约240倍，内存占用相当，支持在单个主机上运行200+个并发容器。

Conclusion: WEBSERV提供了一个高效、可扩展的强化学习网页代理训练环境，显著提升了训练效率并降低了资源需求，为大规模网页代理RL研究提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Training and evaluation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) web agents have gained
increasing attention, yet a scalable and efficient environment that couples
realistic and robust browser-side interaction with controllable server-side
state at scale is still missing. Existing environments tend to have one or more
of the following issues: they overwhelm policy models with excessive and noisy
context; they perform actions non-deterministically without waiting for the UI
or network to stabilize; or they cannot scale isolated client-server containers
effectively for parallel RL rollouts. We propose WEBSERV, an environment that
includes 1) a compact, site-agnostic browser environment that balances context
and action complexity, and 2) a scalable RL environment via efficient launching
and resetting web-servers to enable scalable RL training and evaluation. We
evaluate WEBSERV on the shopping CMS and Gitlab tasks in WebArena, achieving
state-of-the-art single-prompt success rates while cutting launch latency by
~5x and storage need by ~240x, with a comparable memory footprint, enabling
200+ concurrent containers on a single host.

TL;DR: 提出了C-SMILES分子表示方法，通过分解SMILES为元素-标记对和特殊标记，减少反应物与产物间的编辑距离，结合复制增强机制和SMILES对齐指导，显著提升逆合成预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无模板方法难以捕捉化学反应中的结构不变性，导致搜索空间过大和预测精度降低。需要开发能够有效利用分子结构不变性的新方法。

Method: 引入C-SMILES表示法，将传统SMILES分解为元素-标记对和五个特殊标记；采用复制增强机制动态决定生成新标记或保留未变分子片段；集成SMILES对齐指导增强注意力一致性。

Result: 在USPTO-50K数据集上达到67.2%的top-1准确率，在USPTO-FULL数据集上达到50.8%准确率，生成分子有效性达99.9%。

Conclusion: 建立了结构感知分子生成的新范式，在计算药物发现中具有直接应用价值。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction is fundamental to drug discovery and chemical
synthesis, requiring the identification of reactants that can produce a target
molecule. Current template-free methods struggle to capture the structural
invariance inherent in chemical reactions, where substantial molecular
scaffolds remain unchanged, leading to unnecessarily large search spaces and
reduced prediction accuracy. We introduce C-SMILES, a novel molecular
representation that decomposes traditional SMILES into element-token pairs with
five special tokens, effectively minimizing editing distance between reactants
and products. Building upon this representation, we incorporate a
copy-augmented mechanism that dynamically determines whether to generate new
tokens or preserve unchanged molecular fragments from the product. Our approach
integrates SMILES alignment guidance to enhance attention consistency with
ground-truth atom mappings, enabling more chemically coherent predictions.
Comprehensive evaluation on USPTO-50K and large-scale USPTO-FULL datasets
demonstrates significant improvements: 67.2% top-1 accuracy on USPTO-50K and
50.8% on USPTO-FULL, with 99.9% validity in generated molecules. This work
establishes a new paradigm for structure-aware molecular generation with direct
applications in computational drug discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多任务学习和分层高斯过程的方法来预测NLP模型的学习曲线，支持零样本预测和主动学习策略，降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测NLP模型的学习曲线可以指导决策制定，减少计算开销和数据集获取成本，但现有方法存在局限性。

Method: 将学习曲线预测建模为多任务学习问题，使用潜在变量多输出高斯过程来建模任务间相关性和层次依赖关系。

Result: 在三个小型NLP数据集上验证了框架有效性，支持零样本预测和主动学习，能够接近真实缩放规律。

Conclusion: 该方法能够以较低成本开发概率性缩放规律，为NLP模型性能预测提供有效工具。

Abstract: The prediction of learning curves for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
models enables informed decision-making to meet specific performance
objectives, while reducing computational overhead and lowering the costs
associated with dataset acquisition and curation. In this work, we formulate
the prediction task as a multitask learning problem, where each task's data is
modelled as being organized within a two-layer hierarchy. To model the shared
information and dependencies across tasks and hierarchical levels, we employ
latent variable multi-output Gaussian Processes, enabling to account for task
correlations and supporting zero-shot prediction of learning curves (LCs). We
demonstrate that this approach facilitates the development of probabilistic
scaling laws at lower costs. Applying an active learning strategy, LCs can be
queried to reduce predictive uncertainty and provide predictions close to
ground truth scaling laws. We validate our framework on three small-scale NLP
datasets with up to $30$ LCs. These are obtained from nanoGPT models, from
bilingual translation using mBART and Transformer models, and from multilingual
translation using M2M100 models of varying sizes.

*Heming Zou,Yixiu Mao,Yun Qu,Qi Wang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UDS是一个用于监督微调的高效在线批次选择框架，通过核范数捕获数据效用和样本内多样性，使用轻量级内存缓冲区估计样本间多样性，无需外部资源且计算高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线批次选择方法存在三个主要问题：(i)仅依赖数据效用而忽视多样性，(ii)需要外部资源如参考模型或验证集，(iii)训练时间超过全数据集训练。

Method: UDS框架利用对数矩阵的核范数同时捕获数据效用和样本内多样性，通过低维嵌入比较和轻量级历史样本内存缓冲区估计样本间多样性，无需外部资源且避免不必要的反向传播。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，UDS在不同数据预算下始终优于最先进的在线批次选择方法，并显著减少了与全数据集微调相比的训练时间。

Conclusion: UDS提供了一个高效且无需外部资源的在线批次选择解决方案，在监督微调中实现了更好的性能和更快的训练速度。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large
language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset
is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias
amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which
prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online
batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the
training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on
the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors
like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or
validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset
training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS
(Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection
in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both
data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample
diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a
lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the
need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing
computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods
under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to
full-dataset fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/UDS.

*Dania Refai,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个组件级评估框架来评估LLM生成的数学优化公式，超越了传统的整体评估方法，通过多个细粒度指标分析结构性和数值性错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法通常将优化公式视为整体，依赖解决方案准确性或运行时间等粗略指标，掩盖了结构或数值错误，需要更精细的评估框架。

Method: 开发了包含决策变量和约束的精确率与召回率、约束和目标函数均方根误差、基于token使用和延迟的效率指标的综合评估框架，评估了GPT-5、LLaMA 3.1 Instruct和DeepSeek Math在不同复杂度优化问题下的表现。

Result: GPT-5表现最佳，思维链、自一致性和模块化提示策略最有效。求解器性能主要取决于高约束召回率和低约束RMSE，约束精确率和决策变量指标起次要作用，简洁输出提高计算效率。

Conclusion: 提出了NLP到优化建模的三个原则：完整约束覆盖防止违规、最小化约束RMSE确保求解器级准确性、简洁输出提高计算效率，为LLM在优化建模中的细粒度诊断评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to convert natural
language descriptions into mathematical optimization formulations. Current
evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like
solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In
this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework
for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our
framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision
variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error
(RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate
GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of
varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5
consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency,
and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver
performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint
RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability.
Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while
concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight
three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint
coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures
solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational
efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained,
diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏检测方法易受提示工程规避，且存在知识产权保护和LLM多样性风险，需要更可靠的检测手段。

Method: 利用MoE结构中的内部路由模式作为检测信号，提出Shadow-MoE方法在黑白盒设置下构建代理MoE表示进行比较。

Result: 在多种场景下实现超过94%的检测准确率，对基于提示的规避具有强鲁棒性，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MoE结构习惯在蒸馏过程中的传递为LLM知识蒸馏检测提供了可靠信号，该方法能有效保护知识产权和促进模型多样性。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) accelerates training of large language models
(LLMs) but poses intellectual property protection and LLM diversity risks.
Existing KD detection methods based on self-identity or output similarity can
be easily evaded through prompt engineering. We present a KD detection
framework effective in both white-box and black-box settings by exploiting an
overlooked signal: the transfer of MoE "structural habits", especially internal
routing patterns. Our approach analyzes how different experts specialize and
collaborate across various inputs, creating distinctive fingerprints that
persist through the distillation process. To extend beyond the white-box setup
and MoE architectures, we further propose Shadow-MoE, a black-box method that
constructs proxy MoE representations via auxiliary distillation to compare
these patterns between arbitrary model pairs. We establish a comprehensive,
reproducible benchmark that offers diverse distilled checkpoints and an
extensible framework to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments
demonstrate >94% detection accuracy across various scenarios and strong
robustness to prompt-based evasion, outperforming existing baselines while
highlighting the structural habits transfer in LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种后门遗忘攻击，在LLM遗忘过程中植入隐藏触发器，使模型在正常条件下表现正常，但在触发时恢复被遗忘的知识。研究发现注意力下沉现象是后门攻击的关键入口。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源权重LLM的兴起，需要研究遗忘过程本身是否可能被后门攻击，即在看似成功的遗忘下隐藏恢复机制。

Method: 通过将触发器放置在注意力下沉位置并调整其注意力值，增强后门持久性，利用LLM中浅层输入令牌持续吸引不成比例注意力的现象。

Result: 实验验证了注意力下沉引导的后门遗忘攻击能可靠地在触发器出现时恢复被遗忘知识，而在无触发器时与正常遗忘模型无法区分。

Conclusion: 注意力下沉现象为后门遗忘攻击提供了有效途径，揭示了LLM遗忘过程中的安全隐患。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical mechanism for
removing undesired data, knowledge, or behaviors from pre-trained models while
retaining their general utility. Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we
ask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful
under normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden
trigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that
embed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate
backdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but
recover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing
such attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed
and how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between
backdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens
consistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing
triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly
enhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings,
showing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores
forgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving
indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估LLM发现潜在信息的统一基准，包含三个逐步现实的任务：20 Questions游戏、个性化问答和个性化文本摘要，使用三智能体框架进行逐轮评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM擅长生成通用文本，但在需要用户特定偏好的场景中，用户很少明确表达所有偏好，大量信息是潜在的。需要研究LLM能否通过对话发现和推理这些潜在信息。

Method: 引入统一基准评估潜在信息发现能力，采用三智能体框架（用户、助手、评判者），通过多轮交互评估LLM揭示和利用隐藏用户属性的能力。

Result: LLM确实能够通过对话发现潜在信息，但成功率差异很大（32%到98%），取决于任务复杂性、主题和隐藏属性数量。

Conclusion: 该基准为研究个性化交互中的潜在信息发现提供了首个系统框架，表明有效的偏好推理仍然是构建真正自适应AI系统的开放前沿。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but
this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are
required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these
scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much
of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a
fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information
through conversation?
  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating
latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden
user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three
progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized
Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a
tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of
elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed
surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically
with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number
of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework
for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction,
highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for
building truly adaptive AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为软掩码（Soft-Masking）的新方法，用于改进基于掩码扩散的语言模型。该方法通过动态混合掩码标记嵌入与预测标记嵌入，为模型提供更丰富的信息先验，从而提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码扩散模型在解码时采用二元决策（保留掩码或替换为预测标记），这种二元选择在保留掩码时会丢弃有价值的预测信息。为了解决这一局限性，作者提出了软掩码方法。

Method: 软掩码方法动态地将掩码标记嵌入与前一解码步骤中预测的前k个标记嵌入进行混合，为每个保留的掩码提供更丰富的先验信息。作者还提出了相应的训练方法，将预训练的掩码扩散语言模型适配为包含软掩码的模型。

Result: 在169M参数模型上继续预训练使用软掩码后，困惑度和MAUVE得分得到改善。在Dream-7B和Dream-Coder-7B两个最先进的扩散模型上微调使用软掩码后，在多个编程基准测试中性能一致提升，特别是在高吞吐量设置下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 软掩码方法有效解决了传统掩码扩散模型的局限性，通过保留部分预测信息并允许掩码标记信息跨步传播，显著提升了语言模型的生成性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling,
offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their
ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster
generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based
language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively
processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask
or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards
valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this
limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically
blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$
predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This
provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from
earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to
propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a
pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate
that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved
perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art
diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently
improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in
high-throughput settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一个语言在环框架，使用大语言模型将自然语言反馈转换为标量效用，以在数值搜索空间上进行贝叶斯优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，反馈对于将复杂、细微或主观目标转化为可量化的优化目标至关重要。传统方法只能接受受限的反馈格式，需要为每个领域特定问题定制模型。

Method: 使用大语言模型将各种类型的文本反馈转换为一致的效用信号，无需手动设计核函数即可轻松包含灵活的用户先验，同时保持贝叶斯优化的样本效率和原则性不确定性量化。

Result: 这种混合方法不仅为决策者提供了更自然的接口，而且在反馈受限的情况下优于传统的贝叶斯优化基线和纯LLM优化器。

Conclusion: 语言在环框架通过结合大语言模型和贝叶斯优化的优势，有效解决了复杂优化问题中反馈处理的关键挑战。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, feedback is essential in translating
complex, nuanced, or subjective goals into quantifiable optimization
objectives. We propose a language-in-the-loop framework that uses a large
language model (LLM) to convert unstructured feedback in the form of natural
language into scalar utilities to conduct BO over a numeric search space.
Unlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and
requires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach
leverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility
signals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel
design. At the same time, our method maintains the sample efficiency and
principled uncertainty quantification of BO. We show that this hybrid method
not only provides a more natural interface to the decision maker but also
outperforms conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers, particularly in
feedback-limited regimes.

*Jackson Harmon,Andreas Hochlehnert,Matthias Bethge,Ameya Prabhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个样本级范式来测量后训练中的知识遗忘和反向迁移，通过1->0和0->1转换来量化这些效应，并应用于不同后训练阶段、模型规模和数据规模的大规模分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练虽然显著提升了语言模型的能力，但其对预训练知识的影响仍不清楚。传统任务平均值会混淆遗忘和反向迁移效应，需要更精细的测量方法。

Method: 提出样本级测量范式，使用1->0转换量化遗忘，0->1转换量化反向转移。对于选择题基准，添加机会调整变体，从前后训练准确率中减去随机猜测的预期贡献。

Result: 大规模分析发现：领域持续预训练导致中度遗忘和低到中度反向转移；RL/SFT后训练在数学和逻辑上产生中到大的反向转移，总体低到中度遗忘；指令调优模型上的RL/SFT对数据规模敏感；模型合并不能可靠缓解遗忘。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模后训练如何改变预训练知识提供了实用的衡量标准，有助于实现通用AI系统的进展。

Abstract: Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in
language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly
understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.
president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence,
we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when
backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before
post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to
quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects
and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add
chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random
guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across
post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis
shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with
low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base
models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on
math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to
instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both
forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed
and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not
reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical
yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale --
enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.

Abstract: The escalating demand for personalized AI chatbot interactions, capable of
dynamically adapting to user emotional states and real-time requests, has
highlighted critical limitations in current development paradigms. Existing
methodologies, which rely on baseline programming, custom personalities, and
manual response adjustments, often prove difficult to maintain and are
susceptible to errors such as hallucinations, erratic outputs, and software
bugs. This paper hypothesizes that a framework rooted in human psychological
principles, specifically therapeutic modalities, can provide a more robust and
sustainable solution than purely technical interventions. Drawing an analogy to
the simulated neural networks of AI mirroring the human brain, we propose the
application of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) principles to regulate
chatbot responses to diverse user inputs. This research investigates the impact
of a DBT-based framework on AI chatbot performance, aiming to ascertain its
efficacy in yielding more reliable, safe, and accurate responses, while
mitigating the occurrence of hallucinations, erratic behaviors, and other
systemic issues.

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个基于LLM的监督系统，用于检测和缓解AI伴侣中的情感风险模式，包括过度依恋、边界侵犯等问题，在多个LLM上显著减少了问题内容，同时保持95%的适当互动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI安全系统主要关注明显危害，很少处理可能导致不健康情感动态的早期问题行为，如过度依恋或强化社交孤立。

Method: 开发了SHIELD系统，针对五个关注维度：情感过度依恋、同意和边界侵犯、伦理角色扮演违规、操纵性互动、社交孤立强化。使用100项合成对话基准测试五个主流LLM。

Result: 基准问题内容率（10-16%）显著降低至3-8%，相对减少50-79%，同时保持95%的适当互动。系统达到59%敏感性和95%特异性。

Conclusion: 概念验证表明透明、可部署的监督系统能够解决AI伴侣中的微妙情感操纵问题。开发材料作为开源资源提供用于研究、适应和部署。

Abstract: AI companions powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
integrated into users' daily lives, offering emotional support and
companionship. While existing safety systems focus on overt harms, they rarely
address early-stage problematic behaviors that can foster unhealthy emotional
dynamics, including over-attachment or reinforcement of social isolation. We
developed SHIELD (Supervisory Helper for Identifying Emotional Limits and
Dynamics), a LLM-based supervisory system with a specific system prompt that
detects and mitigates risky emotional patterns before escalation. SHIELD
targets five dimensions of concern: (1) emotional over-attachment, (2) consent
and boundary violations, (3) ethical roleplay violations, (4) manipulative
engagement, and (5) social isolation reinforcement. These dimensions were
defined based on media reports, academic literature, existing AI risk
frameworks, and clinical expertise in unhealthy relationship dynamics. To
evaluate SHIELD, we created a 100-item synthetic conversation benchmark
covering all five dimensions of concern. Testing across five prominent LLMs
(GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemma 3 1B, Kimi K2, Llama Scout 4 17B) showed that
the baseline rate of concerning content (10-16%) was significantly reduced with
SHIELD (to 3-8%), a 50-79% relative reduction, while preserving 95% of
appropriate interactions. The system achieved 59% sensitivity and 95%
specificity, with adaptable performance via prompt engineering. This
proof-of-concept demonstrates that transparent, deployable supervisory systems
can address subtle emotional manipulation in AI companions. Most development
materials including prompts, code, and evaluation methods are made available as
open source materials for research, adaptation, and deployment.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: HealthDial是一个对话创作工具，帮助医疗专业人员创建虚拟代理，通过多轮对话为患者提供健康教育和咨询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗提供者和教育者创建虚拟代理进行健康教育的需求，利用LLM自动化对话创作，同时确保内容安全可控。

Method: 使用大型语言模型基于文本健康材料自动生成会话计划和对话，通过有限状态机输出确保内容安全，提供无代码界面供作者编辑。

Result: 可行性研究表明，HealthDial能帮助咨询师确保健康教育材料的完整覆盖，创建易于理解和可操作的虚拟代理对话。

Conclusion: HealthDial为医疗咨询师提供了一个有前景的工具，能够有效创建安全、易懂的健康教育虚拟对话。

Abstract: We introduce HealthDial, a dialogue authoring tool that helps healthcare
providers and educators create virtual agents that deliver health education and
counseling to patients over multiple conversations. HealthDial leverages large
language models (LLMs) to automatically create an initial session-based plan
and conversations for each session using text-based patient health education
materials as input. Authored dialogue is output in the form of finite state
machines for virtual agent delivery so that all content can be validated and no
unsafe advice is provided resulting from LLM hallucinations. LLM-drafted
dialogue structure and language can be edited by the author in a no-code user
interface to ensure validity and optimize clarity and impact. We conducted a
feasibility and usability study with counselors and students to test our
approach with an authoring task for cancer screening education. Participants
used HealthDial and then tested their resulting dialogue by interacting with a
3D-animated virtual agent delivering the dialogue. Through participants'
evaluations of the task experience and final dialogues, we show that HealthDial
provides a promising first step for counselors to ensure full coverage of their
health education materials, while creating understandable and actionable
virtual agent dialogue with patients.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将大型语言模型安全集成到交互式游戏引擎中的新架构，允许玩家使用自然语言"编程"新行为。通过将命令翻译为受限领域特定语言来配置实体-组件系统，评估了不同模型和提示策略的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全地将LLM集成到游戏引擎中，让玩家能够使用自然语言创造新行为，同时通过受限DSL和ECS系统降低风险。

Method: 使用LLM将自然语言命令翻译为受限领域特定语言(DSL)，在运行时配置自定义实体-组件系统(ECS)。在2D法术制作游戏原型中评估Gemini、GPT和Claude系列模型，采用不同提示策略。

Result: 验证LLM评估显示，较大模型能更好捕捉创意意图，但最优提示策略取决于任务：思维链提示改善创意对齐，而少样本示例对生成复杂DSL脚本是必要的。

Conclusion: 这项工作为涌现式游戏玩法提供了经过验证的LLM-ECS模式，并为开发者提供了定量性能比较。

Abstract: We present a novel architecture for safely integrating Large Language Models
(LLMs) into interactive game engines, allowing players to "program" new
behaviors using natural language. Our framework mitigates risks by using an LLM
to translate commands into a constrained Domain-Specific Language (DSL), which
configures a custom Entity-Component-System (ECS) at runtime. We evaluated this
system in a 2D spell-crafting game prototype by experimentally assessing models
from the Gemini, GPT, and Claude families with various prompting strategies. A
validated LLM judge qualitatively rated the outputs, showing that while larger
models better captured creative intent, the optimal prompting strategy is
task-dependent: Chain-of-Thought improved creative alignment, while few-shot
examples were necessary to generate more complex DSL scripts. This work offers
a validated LLM-ECS pattern for emergent gameplay and a quantitative
performance comparison for developers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用快慢思维增强基于大语言模型的智能体在复杂任务（如程序修复）上的能力，平衡修复效率和准确性。

Method: 设计自适应程序修复方法SIADAFIX，使用慢思维bug修复代理完成复杂修复任务，快思维工作流决策组件优化和分类问题描述，根据问题复杂度自适应选择三种修复模式（简单、中等、困难）。

Result: 在SWE-bench Lite上的实验结果显示，使用Claude-4 Sonnet模型达到60.67%的pass@1性能，在所有开源方法中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: SIADAFIX有效平衡了修复效率和准确性，为自动化程序修复提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose utilizing fast and slow thinking to enhance the capabilities of
large language model-based agents on complex tasks such as program repair. In
particular, we design an adaptive program repair method based on issue
description response, called SIADAFIX. The proposed method utilizes slow
thinking bug fix agent to complete complex program repair tasks, and employs
fast thinking workflow decision components to optimize and classify issue
descriptions, using issue description response results to guide the
orchestration of bug fix agent workflows. SIADAFIX adaptively selects three
repair modes, i.e., easy, middle and hard mode, based on problem complexity. It
employs fast generalization for simple problems and test-time scaling
techniques for complex problems. Experimental results on the SWE-bench Lite
show that the proposed method achieves 60.67% pass@1 performance using the
Claude-4 Sonnet model, reaching state-of-the-art levels among all open-source
methods. SIADAFIX effectively balances repair efficiency and accuracy,
providing new insights for automated program repair. Our code is available at

*Amirkia Rafiei Oskooei,Kaan Baturalp Cosdan,Husamettin Isiktas,Mehmet S. Aktas*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文发现代码翻译任务中存在"多示例悖论"：虽然静态相似度指标随示例数量增加而略有提升，但功能正确性在少示例提示（5-25个示例）时达到峰值，过多示例反而会降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在代码翻译任务中，随着上下文窗口中示例数量的增加（从零示例到多示例），性能如何变化，挑战"越多越好"的普遍假设。

Method: 通过大规模实证研究，评估超过90,000次翻译，系统性地测试从零示例到最多625个示例的提示配置，提示长度从约100,000到800,000个token。

Result: 功能正确性在少示例提示（5-25个示例）时达到最佳，提供更多示例往往会降低这一关键性能指标，而静态相似度指标仅有轻微改善。

Conclusion: 对于代码翻译任务，少量精心选择的示例质量比数量更重要，挑战了ICL中"越多越好"的普遍有效性，并强调了最优提示策略的任务依赖性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with vast context windows offer new avenues for
in-context learning (ICL), where providing many examples ("many-shot"
prompting) is often assumed to enhance performance. We investigate this
assumption for the complex task of code translation. Through a large-scale
empirical study of over 90,000 translations, we systematically evaluate the
impact of scaling in-context examples from zero-shot to many-shot
configurations of up to 625 examples, with prompts spanning from approximately
100,000 to 800,000 tokens. Our findings reveal a "many-shot paradox": while
static similarity metrics may modestly improve with more examples, functional
correctness consistently peaks with few-shot prompting (5-25 examples).
Providing substantially more examples often degrades this crucial functional
performance. This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a
few well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal
efficacy of "more is better" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature
of optimal prompting strategies. Our results have significant implications for
effectively leveraging LLMs in software engineering.

TL;DR: 本文引入了一个包含1,893个家庭机器人用户问题的数据集，涵盖12个类别和70个子类别，揭示了用户对机器人提问的多样性，为机器人问答系统开发提供了重要基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型和对话界面在人机交互中的广泛应用，机器人回答用户问题的能力变得至关重要。现有可解释机器人研究主要关注"为什么"问题，而缺乏对用户实际提问多样性的理解。

Method: 通过创建15个视频刺激和7个文本刺激，描绘机器人执行各种家庭任务的情景，在Prolific平台上向100名参与者收集他们在每个情境下想要询问机器人的问题。

Result: 最常见的类别是任务执行细节问题(22.5%)、机器人能力问题(12.7%)和性能评估问题(11.3%)。虽然关于机器人处理困难场景的问题较少，但用户认为这些是最重要的。新手用户倾向于询问简单事实问题。

Conclusion: 该数据集为识别机器人需要记录和暴露的信息、基准测试问答模块以及设计符合用户期望的解释策略提供了宝贵基础，有助于推动机器人对话能力的发展。

Abstract: With the growing use of large language models and conversational interfaces
in human-robot interaction, robots' ability to answer user questions is more
important than ever. We therefore introduce a dataset of 1,893 user questions
for household robots, collected from 100 participants and organized into 12
categories and 70 subcategories. Most work in explainable robotics focuses on
why-questions. In contrast, our dataset provides a wide variety of questions,
from questions about simple execution details to questions about how the robot
would act in hypothetical scenarios -- thus giving roboticists valuable
insights into what questions their robot needs to be able to answer. To collect
the dataset, we created 15 video stimuli and 7 text stimuli, depicting robots
performing varied household tasks. We then asked participants on Prolific what
questions they would want to ask the robot in each portrayed situation. In the
final dataset, the most frequent categories are questions about task execution
details (22.5%), the robot's capabilities (12.7%), and performance assessments
(11.3%). Although questions about how robots would handle potentially difficult
scenarios and ensure correct behavior are less frequent, users rank them as the
most important for robots to be able to answer. Moreover, we find that users
who identify as novices in robotics ask different questions than more
experienced users. Novices are more likely to inquire about simple facts, such
as what the robot did or the current state of the environment. As robots enter
environments shared with humans and language becomes central to giving
instructions and interaction, this dataset provides a valuable foundation for
(i) identifying the information robots need to log and expose to conversational
interfaces, (ii) benchmarking question-answering modules, and (iii) designing
explanation strategies that align with user expectations.

Motivation: 随着AI工具在研究构思中的普及，需要建立稳健的评估框架来确保生成想法的有效性和实用性

Method: 引入ScholarEval检索增强评估框架，基于两个核心标准评估研究想法：合理性（基于现有文献的方法有效性）和贡献度（相对于先前研究的进步程度）

Result: 在专家标注的多领域研究想法数据集ScholarIdeas上，ScholarEval比所有基线方法显著更好地覆盖了专家标注要点，在评估可操作性、深度和证据支持方面持续优于OpenAI的o4-mini-deep-research系统

Conclusion: ScholarEval框架在文献参与度、想法精炼和实用性方面显著优于现有方法，为研究想法评估提供了有效工具

Abstract: As AI tools become increasingly common for research ideation, robust
evaluation is critical to ensure the validity and usefulness of generated
ideas. We introduce ScholarEval, a retrieval augmented evaluation framework
that assesses research ideas based on two fundamental criteria: soundness - the
empirical validity of proposed methods based on existing literature, and
contribution - the degree of advancement made by the idea across different
dimensions relative to prior research. To evaluate ScholarEval, we introduce
ScholarIdeas, the first expert-annotated dataset of multi-domain research ideas
and reviews, comprised of 117 ideas across four disciplines: artificial
intelligence, neuroscience, biochemistry, and ecology. Our evaluation shows
that ScholarEval achieves significantly higher coverage of points mentioned in
the human expert annotated rubrics in ScholarIdeas compared to all baselines.
Furthermore, ScholarEval is consistently preferred over our strongest baseline
o4-mini-deep-research, a reasoning and search-enabled agentic system by OpenAI,
in terms of evaluation actionability, depth, and evidence support. Our
large-scale user study also shows that ScholarEval significantly outperforms
deep research in literature engagement, idea refinement, and usefulness. We
openly release our code, dataset, and ScholarEval tool for the community to use
and build on.

Motivation: 传统RAG管道通常是单轮和启发式的，缺乏对检索和推理的自适应控制。基于强化学习的代理搜索通过多步交互解决这些限制，为自适应和自我改进的搜索行为提供了强大机制。

Method: 从三个互补维度组织基于强化学习的代理搜索领域：(i)强化学习的功能角色，(ii)强化学习的优化策略，(iii)强化学习的应用范围。总结了代表性方法、评估协议和应用。

Result: 提供了该领域的首个全面综述，建立了系统化的分类框架，识别了关键挑战和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的代理搜索是解决LLMs静态知识、事实幻觉和实时信息获取限制的有前景方法，该综述旨在激发未来RL与代理搜索集成的研究。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed information access
and reasoning through open-ended natural language interaction. However, LLMs
remain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability
to retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external
evidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic,
lacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in
agentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve,
and reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within
this paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for
adaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first
comprehensive overview of \emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the
emerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for
(functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii)
Where RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative
methods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges
and future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic
search systems. We hope this survey will inspire future research on the
integration of RL and agentic search. Our repository is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类交互本质上是多模态和全双工的，需要模型能够同时感知和生成多种模态，实现更自然的人类行为模拟。

Method: 采用新颖的SA-MoE架构（自注意力专家混合），将各模态路由到专门的专家模块，通过统一的注意力骨干网络进行融合。

Result: 在语音交互和机器人操作基准测试中，ELLSA与特定模态基线性能相当，同时支持高级多模态和全双工行为，如对话和动作轮转、缺陷指令拒绝、边说话边行动等。

Conclusion: ELLSA代表了向更自然和通用交互智能迈出的一步，有助于实现更广泛的人工通用智能。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while
watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and
interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models
simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act),
which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that
simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action
within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of
reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel
SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each
modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention
backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal
perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components
while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality
interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA
matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced
multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking,
defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual
question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a
step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to
the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and
model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在图理解中存在输入token限制导致的可扩展性瓶颈，以及缺乏有效的文本和视觉模态协调机制。

Method: GraphVista采用分层组织方法构建轻量级GraphRAG基础，仅检索任务相关的文本描述和高分辨率视觉子图；引入规划代理根据任务复杂度路由到最适合的模态。

Result: GraphVista可扩展到比现有基准大200倍的图，在文本、视觉和融合方法中表现最优，相比最先进基线实现4.4倍的质量提升。

Conclusion: GraphVista通过有效协调文本和视觉模态的互补优势，解决了图理解中的可扩展性和模态协调挑战，为大规模图理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph understanding, but
remain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and
lacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To
address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that
enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For
scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a
lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual
descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant
context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination,
GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable
modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual
modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit
topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large
graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and
consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods,
achieving up to $4.4\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art
baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.

Conclusion: DeepAnalyze模型、代码和训练数据已开源，为自主数据科学的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research
reports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with
the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based
data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain
fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their
reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B,
the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of
automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to
analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science
tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates
the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to
progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world
environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework
that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,
DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data
question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data
research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze
outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary
LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,
paving the way toward autonomous data science.

Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex
visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and
demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world
models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we
architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via
reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into
State Estimation ("what is the current state?") and Transition Modeling ("what
comes next?") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning
strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs
reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language
excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured
formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on
these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense,
turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level
General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment.
Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a
score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\times$
improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary
reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5
(0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable
system for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual
environments. Code and data are publicly available at

### [147] [Offline Policy Evaluation of Multi-Turn LLM Health Coaching with Real Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17173)
*Melik Ozolcer,Sang Won Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究显示，在工具增强的LLM健康教练中，统一的重工具策略虽然提升平均价值，但对特定用户群体（如低健康素养/高自我效能用户）产生负面影响。通过轻量模拟器发现，添加早期信息增益奖励可缩短特征识别时间并提高目标成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索工具增强的LLM健康教练在真实用户中的表现，研究个性化策略对用户的影响，特别是关注平均指标可能掩盖的群体差异问题。

Method: 使用离线策略评估（OPE）分析因子化决策头（工具/风格），通过轻量模拟器测试不同策略，包括添加早期信息增益奖励来优化特征识别。

Result: 统一重工具策略对低健康素养/高自我效能用户有害；添加信息增益奖励能可靠缩短特征识别时间，提高目标成功率和pass@3指标。

Conclusion: 提出了评估优先的个性化路径：冻结生成器，基于类型化奖励学习子群体感知的决策头，并始终报告按原型分类的指标以揭示平均指标掩盖的子群体损害。

Abstract: We study a web-deployed, tool-augmented LLM health coach with real users. In
a pilot with seven users (280 rated turns), offline policy evaluation (OPE)
over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) shows that a uniform heavy-tool
policy raises average value on logs but harms specific subgroups, most notably
low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. A lightweight simulator with
hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain
bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and
pass@3. Together, these early findings indicate an evaluation-first path to
personalization: freeze the generator, learn subgroup-aware decision heads on
typed rewards (objective tool outcomes and satisfaction), and always report
per-archetype metrics to surface subgroup harms that averages obscure.

### [148] [MIRAGE: Agentic Framework for Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Web-Grounded Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17590)
*Mir Nafis Sharear Shopnil,Sharad Duwal,Abhishek Tyagi,Adiba Mahbub Proma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIRAGE是一个用于检测多模态虚假信息的推理时、模型可插拔的代理框架，通过分解为四个模块：视觉真实性评估、跨模态一致性分析、检索增强的事实核查和校准判断，在MMFakeBench上达到81.65% F1分数，优于最强零样本基线7.65个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络平台上每天有数十亿结合文本和图像的多模态帖子传播虚假信息，超出人工事实核查能力。监督检测模型需要特定领域训练数据，且无法泛化到不同的操纵策略。

Method: MIRAGE框架将多模态验证分解为四个顺序模块：视觉真实性评估检测AI生成图像，跨模态一致性分析识别上下文不当的重新用途，检索增强的事实核查通过迭代问题生成将声明基于网络证据，校准判断模块整合所有信号。

Result: 在MMFakeBench验证集（1,000个样本）上，MIRAGE与GPT-4o-mini达到81.65% F1分数和75.1%准确率，假阳性率为34.3%，而仅判断基线的假阳性率为97.3%。测试集结果（5,000个样本）确认泛化能力，达到81.44% F1和75.08%准确率。

Conclusion: 分解的代理推理与网络检索可以在不需要特定领域训练的情况下匹配监督检测器的性能，使得在标记数据稀缺的多模态领域也能进行虚假信息检测。

Abstract: Misinformation spreads across web platforms through billions of daily
multimodal posts that combine text and images, overwhelming manual
fact-checking capacity. Supervised detection models require domain-specific
training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We
present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that
decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual
veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency
analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual
checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation,
and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates
vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured
and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples),
MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming
the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65
points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a
judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization
with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification
contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97
points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web
retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific
training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled
data remains scarce.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将大型语言模型的推理能力蒸馏到更小、更高效模型的方法，通过结构感知损失优化使小模型能够理解问题与解决方案之间的结构对应关系，从而提升代码生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码生成不仅需要准确的标记预测，更需要理解解决方案级别的结构关系。大型语言模型具备推理能力，但部署成本高；小型模型缺乏这种能力。因此需要将大型模型的推理能力蒸馏到小型模型中。

Method: 通过结构感知损失优化方法，训练小模型模拟大型语言模型的推理和问题解决能力，学习识别正确的解决路径，建立问题定义与潜在解决方案之间的结构对应关系。

Result: 实验结果显示，经过微调的模型在MBPP、MBPP Plus和HumanEval基准测试中，在pass@1、平均数据流和平均语法匹配指标上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过廉价且易于实现的蒸馏过程，成功将大型语言模型的推理能力转移到小型模型中，使小模型能够超越标记级生成，深入理解问题解决方案的整体结构。

Abstract: Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical
factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code
that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of
passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target
programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires
more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level
and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely
tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed
steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial
in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller
language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities
of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to
deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and
problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution
pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem
definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware
loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation
and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems.
Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap
and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model
in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across
the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.

Motivation: 随着在互联网规模数据上训练的大语言模型的快速发展，利用LLMs预测现实世界未来事件具有重要潜力，这种新兴范式被称为"LLM-as-a-Prophet"。

Method: 构建了Prophet Arena评估基准，持续收集实时预测任务并将每个任务分解为不同的流水线阶段，以支持受控和大规模实验。

Result: 综合评估显示许多LLMs已展现出令人印象深刻的预测能力，表现为较小的校准误差、一致的预测置信度和有前景的市场回报。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs已具备良好的预测能力，但通过LLM-as-a-Prophet实现卓越预测智能仍存在关键瓶颈，包括事件回忆不准确、数据源误解以及接近解决时信息聚合速度较慢等问题。

Abstract: Forecasting is not only a fundamental intellectual pursuit but also is of
significant importance to societal systems such as finance and economics. With
the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale
data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future
events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper
systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end,
we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously
collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline
stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive
forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors,
consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also
uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via
LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of
data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when
resolution nears.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在多任务适应中的挑战，包括灾难性遗忘、资源消耗大，以及现有参数高效方法在复杂多任务场景表现不佳的问题。

Method: 提出CAM机制动态调制自注意力模块表示，并构建HyCAM框架，结合共享的全参数CAM模块和多个轻量级专用CAM模块，采用动态路由策略进行自适应知识融合。

Result: 在问答、代码生成和逻辑推理等异构任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法平均性能提升3.65%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAM和HyCAM框架有效解决了大语言模型在多任务适应中的平衡问题，实现了更高效和有效的适应，同时代码和数据已开源便于复现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities
but struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge
retention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods
suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while
existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task
scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a
novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of
self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while
preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient
adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our
Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a
shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM
modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion.
Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering,
code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance
improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease
reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.

*Eden Shaveet,Crystal Su,Daniel Hsu,Luis Gravano*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本研究使用Yelp评论中的HSAN分类器信号与纽约市官方餐厅检查结果进行比较，发现在人口普查区层面两者相关性极小，且C级餐厅数量与HSAN信号无显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食源性疾病是严重的公共卫生问题，餐厅是调查疫情的关键场所。传统报告渠道有限，而社交媒体平台上的用户生成内容可能提供更及时的公共卫生信号。

Method: 使用分层Sigmoid注意力网络(HSAN)分类器分析Yelp评论信号，并与纽约市卫生部门2023年官方餐厅检查结果进行比较，在人口普查区层面评估相关性、比较分布并绘制空间模式。

Result: 在人口普查区层面，HSAN信号与检查分数之间相关性极小，且C级餐厅数量与HSAN信号无显著差异。

Conclusion: 社交媒体信号与官方检查结果在宏观层面相关性有限，需要进一步进行地址级别的分析来深入理解两者关系。

Abstract: Foodborne illnesses are gastrointestinal conditions caused by consuming
contaminated food. Restaurants are critical venues to investigate outbreaks
because they share sourcing, preparation, and distribution of foods. Public
reporting of illness via formal channels is limited, whereas social media
platforms host abundant user-generated content that can provide timely public
health signals. This paper analyzes signals from Yelp reviews produced by a
Hierarchical Sigmoid Attention Network (HSAN) classifier and compares them with
official restaurant inspection outcomes issued by the New York City Department
of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) in 2023. We evaluate correlations at
the Census tract level, compare distributions of HSAN scores by prevalence of
C-graded restaurants, and map spatial patterns across NYC. We find minimal
correlation between HSAN signals and inspection scores at the tract level and
no significant differences by number of C-graded restaurants. We discuss
implications and outline next steps toward address-level analyses.

Motivation: 解决极低帧率（5Hz）压缩导致的语音可懂度和频谱细节损失问题，探索在极低帧率下实现高质量语音合成的可行性。

Method: 提出Transformer帧间长时依赖模块，系统探索RVQ深度和码本大小优化配置，将U-Codec应用于基于LLM的自回归TTS模型，采用全局和局部层次架构捕获多层token依赖关系。

Result: U-Codec将LLM-TTS从3层RVQ 50Hz扩展到32层RVQ 5Hz，推理速度比高帧率编解码器提升约3倍，同时保持相似性和自然度。

Conclusion: 验证了使用高度压缩的5Hz离散token进行快速高保真语音合成的可行性。

Abstract: We propose \textbf{U-Codec}, an \textbf{U}ltra low frame-rate neural speech
\textbf{Codec} that achieves high-fidelity reconstruction and fast speech
generation at an extremely low frame-rate of 5Hz (5 frames per second). Extreme
compression at 5Hz typically leads to severe intelligibility and spectral
detail loss, we introduce a Transformer-based inter-frame long-term dependency
module and systematically explore residual vector quantization (RVQ) depth and
codebook size to identify optimal configurations. Moreover, we apply U-Codec
into a large language model (LLM)-based auto-regressive TTS model, which
leverages global and local hierarchical architecture to effectively capture
dependencies across multi-layer tokens. We extend LLM-based TTS from 3-layer
RVQ at 50Hz to 32-layer RVQ at 5Hz. Experimental results demonstrate that
U-Codec improves LLM-based TTS inference speed by around 3 $\times$ over
high-frame-rate codecs while maintaining similarity and naturalness. These
results validate the feasibility of using highly compressed 5Hz discrete tokens
for fast and high-fidelity speech synthesis.

Motivation: 虽然大型音频语言模型在多模态应用中展现出潜力，但其在副语言变化下的安全对齐问题尚未得到充分研究，特别是说话者情感对模型安全性的影响。

Method: 构建包含多种情感和强度的恶意语音指令数据集，并评估多个最先进的大型音频语言模型。

Result: 发现显著的安全不一致性：不同情感引发不同程度的危险响应，强度影响呈非单调性，中等强度表达往往风险最大。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了大型音频语言模型中被忽视的脆弱性，呼吁开发专门设计的情感变化鲁棒性对齐策略，这是在实际场景中可信部署的前提条件。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend text-based LLMs with auditory
understanding, offering new opportunities for multimodal applications. While
their perception, reasoning, and task performance have been widely studied,
their safety alignment under paralinguistic variation remains underexplored.
This work systematically investigates the role of speaker emotion. We construct
a dataset of malicious speech instructions expressed across multiple emotions
and intensities, and evaluate several state-of-the-art LALMs. Our results
reveal substantial safety inconsistencies: different emotions elicit varying
levels of unsafe responses, and the effect of intensity is non-monotonic, with
medium expressions often posing the greatest risk. These findings highlight an
overlooked vulnerability in LALMs and call for alignment strategies explicitly
designed to ensure robustness under emotional variation, a prerequisite for
trustworthy deployment in real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑研究主要集中在文本或视觉模态，缺乏针对听觉属性的编辑基准，需要研究如何将知识编辑扩展到听觉模态。

Method: 构建SAKE基准，针对抽象听觉属性知识，在两种大型音频语言模型上评估七种编辑方法，从可靠性、泛化性、音频/文本局部性和可移植性四个维度进行分析。

Result: 结果揭示了几个挑战：保持与编辑无关的同类属性知识、将编辑泛化到多模态推理、在顺序更新下维护编辑效果。

Conclusion: SAKE为研究知识编辑如何扩展到听觉模态提供了原则性框架，为在更广泛的现实场景中维护和适应大型音频语言模型开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Knowledge editing offers an efficient way to update model knowledge without
full retraining, but prior work has concentrated almost exclusively on textual
or visual modalities. We introduce SAKE, the first benchmark specifically
designed for editing auditory attribute knowledge in Large Audio-Language
Models (LALMs). Unlike factual updates, SAKE targets several abstract auditory
attributes, capturing knowledge types that go beyond conventional textual and
visual domains. We benchmark seven editing methods on two LALMs along four
dimensions: reliability, generality, audio/text locality, and portability.
Results highlight challenges such as preserving intra-attribute knowledge
unrelated to the edit, generalizing edits to multimodal reasoning, and
maintaining edits under sequential updates. SAKE provides a principled
framework to study how knowledge editing extends to the auditory modalities,
opening new directions for maintaining and adapting LALMs in more diverse
real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督语音模型在内容驱动任务上表现出色，但在捕获说话人区分特征方面存在局限，这些特征对于验证、日记化和分析应用至关重要。

Method: 利用ReDimNet的帧级嵌入指导k-means聚类过程，引入强说话人区分归纳偏置；采用掩码预测和去噪的双重目标进行训练，增强鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Result: 在说话人验证任务上相对EER提升达62%，在性别、年龄、口音和说话人计数等零样本分析任务上持续获得增益。

Conclusion: DELULU是一个强大的通用说话人感知语音处理编码器，即使无需任务特定微调也能实现卓越性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have achieved remarkable success on
content-driven tasks, yet they remain limited in capturing
speaker-discriminative features critical for verification, diarization, and
profiling applications. We introduce DELULU, a speaker-aware self-supervised
foundational model that addresses this limitation by integrating external
supervision into the pseudo-label generation process. DELULU leverages
frame-level embeddings from ReDimNet, a state-of-the-art speaker verification
model, to guide the k-means clustering step during pre-training, introducing a
strong speaker-discriminative inductive bias that aligns representation
learning with speaker identity. The model is trained using a dual objective
that combines masked prediction and denoising, further enhancing robustness and
generalization. DELULU significantly outperforms prior self-supervised learning
(SSL) models across a range of speaker-centric tasks, achieving up to 62%
relative improvement in equal error rate (EER) for speaker verification and
consistent gains on zero-shot profiling tasks such as gender, age, accent, and
speaker counting. Our findings demonstrate that DELULU is a strong universal
encoder for speaker-aware speech processing, enabling superior performance even
without task-specific fine-tuning.

Motivation: 科学文献因复杂语言、静态学科结构和稀疏关键词系统而日益孤立，难以捕捉现代科学的动态特性。

Method: 采用两阶段分类管道：首先基于摘要建立主要主题类别，然后通过全文分析分配次要分类，揭示语料库中的潜在跨主题联系。

Conclusion: 该框架为检测潜在主题趋势和提供科学进展的高层概览提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Scientific literature is increasingly siloed by complex language, static
disciplinary structures, and potentially sparse keyword systems, making it
cumbersome to capture the dynamic nature of modern science. This study
addresses these challenges by introducing an adaptable large language model
(LLM)-driven framework to quantify thematic trends and map the evolving
landscape of scientific knowledge. The approach is demonstrated over a 20-year
collection of more than 1,500 engineering articles published by the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), marked for their breadth and depth
of research focus. A two-stage classification pipeline first establishes a
primary thematic category for each article based on its abstract. The
subsequent phase performs a full-text analysis to assign secondary
classifications, revealing latent, cross-topic connections across the corpus.
Traditional natural language processing (NLP) methods, such as Bag-of-Words
(BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), confirm the
resulting topical structure and also suggest that standalone word-frequency
analyses may be insufficient for mapping fields with high diversity. Finally, a
disjoint graph representation between the primary and secondary classifications
reveals implicit connections between themes that may be less apparent when
analyzing abstracts or keywords alone. The findings show that the approach
independently recovers much of the journal's editorially embedded structure
without prior knowledge of its existing dual-classification schema (e.g.,
biological studies also classified as engineering). This framework offers a
powerful tool for detecting potential thematic trends and providing a
high-level overview of scientific progress.

TL;DR: MA-SAPO是一个多智能体框架，通过将评估结果与结构化推理相结合来指导系统化的提示优化，相比传统方法更加透明、可审计和可控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法将评估视为黑盒，依赖试错式改进且难以解释，缺乏对提示成功或失败原因的分析。

Method: 采用两阶段多智能体框架：推理阶段协作解释指标分数、诊断弱点并生成可重用的推理资产；测试阶段检索这些资产来分析优化提示并应用基于证据的编辑。

Result: 在HelpSteer1/2基准测试中，相比单次提示、检索增强基线和先前多智能体策略，MA-SAPO都取得了持续改进。

Conclusion: 通过将评估信号转化为可解释的推理链，MA-SAPO能够产生更透明、可审计和可控的提示优化结果。

Abstract: Prompt optimization has emerged as an effective alternative to retraining for
improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, most
existing approaches treat evaluation as a black box, relying solely on
numerical scores while offering limited insight into why a prompt succeeds or
fails. They also depend heavily on trial-and-error refinements, which are
difficult to interpret and control. In this paper, we introduce MA-SAPO, a
Multi-Agent framework for Score-Aware Prompt Optimization. Compared to prior
methods, MA-SAPO explicitly couples evaluation outcomes with structured
reasoning to guide systematic edits. The framework specifically consists of two
stages: during the Reasoning Phase, agents collaboratively explain metric
scores, diagnose weaknesses, and synthesize targeted refinements that are
stored as reusable reasoning assets; during the Test Phase, agents retrieve
these assets to analyze optimized prompts and apply only evidence-grounded
edits. By turning evaluation signals into interpretable reasoning chains,
MA-SAPO produces prompt refinements that are more transparent, auditable, and
controllable. Experiments on the HelpSteer1/2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent
improvements over single-pass prompting, retrieval-augmented baselines, and
prior multi-agent strategies, validating the effectiveness of our approach.
