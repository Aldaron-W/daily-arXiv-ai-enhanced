### [1] [A Novel Differential Feature Learning for Effective Hallucination Detection and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21357)
*Wenkai Wang,Vincent Lee,Yizhen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种双模型架构，通过投影融合块和差异特征学习机制来检测大语言模型的幻觉信号，发现幻觉信号集中在高度稀疏的特征子集中，仅需1%的特征维度即可维持检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型幻觉是一个关键挑战，现有研究虽然发现特定隐藏层在幻觉内容和事实内容之间存在差异，但幻觉信号在层内的精确定位仍不明确，限制了高效检测方法的发展。

Method: 采用双模型架构，包含投影融合块用于自适应层间特征加权，以及差异特征学习机制通过计算并行编码器之间的差异来识别判别性特征。在HaluEval的数据集上进行系统实验。

Result: 在问答和对话任务上实现了显著的准确率提升，发现幻觉信号集中在高度稀疏的特征子集中，浅层特征多样性高而深层特征使用集中，仅使用1%的特征维度即可维持检测性能。

Conclusion: 幻觉信号比先前假设的更加集中，这为开发计算效率高的检测系统提供了途径，可以在保持准确性的同时降低推理成本。

Abstract: Large language model hallucination represents a critical challenge where
outputs deviate from factual accuracy due to distributional biases in training
data. While recent investigations establish that specific hidden layers exhibit
differences between hallucinatory and factual content, the precise localization
of hallucination signals within layers remains unclear, limiting the
development of efficient detection methods. We propose a dual-model
architecture integrating a Projected Fusion (PF) block for adaptive inter-layer
feature weighting and a Differential Feature Learning (DFL) mechanism that
identifies discriminative features by computing differences between parallel
encoders learning complementary representations from identical inputs. Through
systematic experiments across HaluEval's question answering, dialogue, and
summarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate
in highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements
on question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a
hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers exhibit high feature
diversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection
performance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\% of feature
dimensions. These findings suggest that hallucination signals are more
concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway toward computationally
efficient detection systems that could reduce inference costs while maintaining
accuracy.

### [2] [Influence Guided Context Selection for Effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21359)
*Jiale Deng,Yanyan Shen,Ziyuan Pei,Youmin Chen,Linpeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文影响力值(CI值)的检索增强生成上下文选择方法，通过量化移除每个上下文对性能的影响来评估上下文质量，有效整合了查询相关性、列表独特性和生成器对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法因检索到的上下文质量差（包含不相关或噪声信息）而效果受限，传统基于预定义质量评估指标的方法对标准RAG改进有限，因为它们未能充分利用可用信息进行全面的质量评估。

Method: 将上下文质量评估重构为推理时数据估值问题，引入CI值度量；开发参数化代理模型预测CI值，采用分层架构捕获局部查询-上下文相关性和全局上下文间交互，通过oracle CI值监督和端到端生成器反馈进行训练。

Result: 在8个NLP任务和多个LLM上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于最先进的基线方法，能有效过滤低质量上下文同时保留关键信息。

Conclusion: CI值提供了一种有效的上下文质量评估方法，通过简单的正CI值保留策略消除了复杂选择超参数调优，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM)
hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its
effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing
irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve
performance through context selection based on predefined context quality
assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute
this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available
information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality
assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize
context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and
introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric
quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when
removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware
relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI
value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining
contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label
dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate
model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a
hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and
global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision
and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and
multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality
contexts while preserving critical information. Code is available at
https://github.com/SJTU-DMTai/RAG-CSM.

### [3] [Context Is What You Need: The Maximum Effective Context Window for Real World Limits of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21361)
*Norman Paulsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM的实际有效上下文窗口远小于宣传的最大上下文窗口，大多数模型在1000个token内就会出现严重性能下降，且有效窗口大小因问题类型而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLM提供商宣传的最大上下文窗口在实际使用中的有效性，揭示真实性能与宣传数据的差距。

Method: 定义了最大有效上下文窗口概念，制定了测试方法，收集了数十万个数据点，比较了多个模型在不同上下文大小和问题类型下的表现。

Result: 最大有效上下文窗口与宣传的最大上下文窗口存在显著差异，大多数模型在1000个token内性能严重下降，所有模型都远未达到宣传的最大窗口大小（差距高达99%）。

Conclusion: LLM的实际有效上下文窗口远小于宣传值，且随问题类型变化，这为改进模型准确性和减少幻觉提供了明确指导。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) providers boast big numbers for maximum context
window sizes. To test the real world use of context windows, we 1) define a
concept of maximum effective context window, 2) formulate a testing method of a
context window's effectiveness over various sizes and problem types, and 3)
create a standardized way to compare model efficacy for increasingly larger
context window sizes to find the point of failure. We collected hundreds of
thousands of data points across several models and found significant
differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum
Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not
only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem
type. A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as
100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens
in context. All models fell far short of their Maximum Context Window by as
much as 99 percent. Our data reveals the Maximum Effective Context Window
shifts based on the type of problem provided, offering clear and actionable
insights into how to improve model accuracy and decrease model hallucination
rates.

### [4] [How Large Language Models Need Symbolism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21404)
*Xiaotie Deng,Hanyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI未来发展需要超越单纯扩展规模，需要人类构建的符号作为指南针来引导大语言模型的直觉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI发展过度依赖规模扩展，缺乏真正的发现能力，需要引入人类知识符号来指导模型

Method: 提出使用人类构建的符号作为指南针，引导大语言模型的直觉能力

Result: 通过符号引导可以解锁真正的发现能力，使AI从盲目直觉转向有指导的探索

Conclusion: AI的未来发展需要结合人类符号知识与模型直觉能力，实现真正的发现与创新

Abstract: We argue that AI's future requires more than scaling. To unlock genuine
discovery, large language models need a compass: human-crafted symbols to guide
their powerful but blind intuition.

### [5] [One Model, Many Morals: Uncovering Cross-Linguistic Misalignments in Computational Moral Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21443)
*Sualeha Farid,Jayden Lin,Zean Chen,Shivani Kumar,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究系统调查了语言如何调节LLMs的道德决策，发现不同语言间存在显著的道德判断不一致性，反映了文化错位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs主要基于英语数据训练，但在多语言多文化环境中部署时，其道德推理能力存在泛化问题，需要研究语言对道德决策的影响。

Method: 将两个成熟的道德推理基准翻译成五种文化和类型学上不同的语言，进行多语言零样本评估，并通过精心构建的研究问题分析差异驱动因素。

Result: 发现LLMs在不同语言间的道德判断存在显著不一致，往往反映文化错位，并揭示了从分歧到推理策略的潜在驱动因素。

Conclusion: 研究提出了结构化的道德推理错误类型学，呼吁开发更具文化意识的AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual and
multicultural environments where moral reasoning is essential for generating
ethically appropriate responses. Yet, the dominant pretraining of LLMs on
English-language data raises critical concerns about their ability to
generalize judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In this
work, we systematically investigate how language mediates moral decision-making
in LLMs. We translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five
culturally and typologically diverse languages, enabling multilingual zero-shot
evaluation. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral
judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment. Through a
combination of carefully constructed research questions, we uncover the
underlying drivers of these disparities, ranging from disagreements to
reasoning strategies employed by LLMs. Finally, through a case study, we link
the role of pretraining data in shaping an LLM's moral compass. Through this
work, we distill our insights into a structured typology of moral reasoning
errors that calls for more culturally-aware AI.

### [6] [LLM-Based Support for Diabetes Diagnosis: Opportunities, Scenarios, and Challenges with GPT-5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21450)
*Gaurav Kumar Gupta,Nirajan Acharya,Pranal Pande*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估GPT-5在糖尿病诊断和管理中的表现，使用符合ADA标准的合成病例，涵盖症状识别、实验室解读、妊娠糖尿病筛查等五个场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病是全球重大健康挑战，早期识别困难。大型语言模型为医疗决策支持提供了新机会，需要评估其在糖尿病管理中的实际表现。

Method: 使用完全基于合成病例的模拟框架，病例符合ADA 2025护理标准，参考NHANES、Pima Indians等公开数据集。测试五个代表性场景，GPT-5进行分类、生成临床推理、患者解释和结构化JSON摘要。

Result: GPT-5表现出与ADA定义标准的高度一致性，可能成为临床医生和患者的双重用途工具。

Conclusion: GPT-5在糖尿病管理中显示出潜力，同时强调了可重复评估框架对于负责任评估医疗领域LLM的重要性。

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a major global health challenge, affecting over half a
billion adults worldwide with prevalence projected to rise. Although the
American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides clear diagnostic thresholds, early
recognition remains difficult due to vague symptoms, borderline laboratory
values, gestational complexity, and the demands of long-term monitoring.
Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to enhance
decision support through structured, interpretable, and patient-friendly
outputs. This study evaluates GPT-5, the latest generative pre-trained
transformer, using a simulation framework built entirely on synthetic cases
aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025 and inspired by public datasets
including NHANES, Pima Indians, EyePACS, and MIMIC-IV. Five representative
scenarios were tested: symptom recognition, laboratory interpretation,
gestational diabetes screening, remote monitoring, and multimodal complication
detection. For each, GPT-5 classified cases, generated clinical rationales,
produced patient explanations, and output structured JSON summaries. Results
showed strong alignment with ADA-defined criteria, suggesting GPT-5 may
function as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients, while underscoring
the importance of reproducible evaluation frameworks for responsibly assessing
LLMs in healthcare.

### [7] [Diagnosing the Performance Trade-off in Moral Alignment: A Case Study on Gender Stereotypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21456)
*Guangliang Liu,Bocheng Chen,Xitong Zhang,Kristen Marie Johnson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了在减轻语言模型性别刻板印象时，公平性目标与下游任务性能之间的权衡机制，揭示了当前公平性目标在实现选择性遗忘刻板印象时会增加整体遗忘水平，从而损害下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究道德对齐过程中性能权衡的底层机制，特别是在减轻性别刻板印象的背景下，通过遗忘和公平性目标的视角来分析性能下降的原因。

Method: 通过分析遗忘和公平性目标的视角，研究选择性遗忘刻板印象对整体遗忘水平和下游任务性能的影响。

Result: 发现下游任务性能主要由整体遗忘水平驱动；选择性遗忘刻板印象会增加整体遗忘；现有的缓解遗忘方法对减少整体遗忘无效，无法改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 当前基于公平性目标的方法在实现性能权衡方面存在局限性，需要新的方法来更有效地平衡道德对齐与任务性能。

Abstract: Moral alignment has emerged as a widely adopted approach for regulating the
behavior of pretrained language models (PLMs), typically through fine-tuning or
model editing on curated datasets. However, this process often comes at the
cost of degraded downstream task performance. Prior studies commonly aim to
achieve a performance trade-off by encouraging PLMs to selectively forget
stereotypical knowledge through carefully designed fairness objectives, while
preserving their helpfulness. In this short paper, we investigate the
underlying mechanisms of the performance trade-off in the context of mitigating
gender stereotypes, through the lens of forgetting and the fairness objective.
Our analysis reveals the limitations of current fairness objective in achieving
trade-off by demonstrating that: (1) downstream task performance is primarily
driven by the overall forgetting level; (2) selective forgetting of stereotypes
tends to increase overall forgetting; and (3) general solutions for mitigating
forgetting are ineffective at reducing overall forgetting and fail to improve
downstream task performance.

### [8] [A State-of-the-Art SQL Reasoning Model using RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21459)
*Alnur Ali,Ashutosh Baheti,Jonathan Chang,Ta-Chung Chi,Brandon Cui,Andrew Drozdov,Jonathan Frankle,Abhay Gupta,Pallavi Koppol,Sean Kulinski,Jonathan Li,Dipendra Misra,Krista Opsahl-Ong,Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz,Matei Zaharia,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的自定义推理模型训练方法，在BIRD数据科学基准测试中实现了最先进的准确率，无需额外训练数据或专有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够整合组织特定知识的自定义推理模型，解决企业客户面临的问题，特别是在奖励函数可验证的RLVR设置下。

Method: 采用简单通用的训练方法：精心设计的提示和模型选择、使用离线RL方法TAO进行预热阶段、严格的在线RLVR训练。

Result: 在BIRD排行榜上首次提交即达到私有测试集的最先进准确率：无自一致性73.56%，有自一致性75.68%，且需要更少的生成次数。

Conclusion: 该框架简单易用，可广泛应用于企业领域如商业智能、数据科学和编程任务。

Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can
incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address
problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward
function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We
apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the
ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to
SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving
careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL
approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no
additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary
models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached
state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without
self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our
model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD
is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly
applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science,
and coding.

### [9] [Learning to Reason with Mixture of Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21482)
*Adit Jain,Brendan Rappazzo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出在强化学习可验证奖励（RLVR）中使用混合token生成（MoT-G）方法，通过保留和利用模型在候选token上的概率分布信息，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法在推理步骤中采样离散token，丢弃了模型在候选token上的丰富分布信息，这限制了推理搜索空间。

Method: 提出了统一的MoT-G框架，将RLVR扩展到连续混合空间中生成思维链，包括构建混合嵌入作为token嵌入的加权和。

Result: 在Reasoning-Gym推理任务套件上，MoT-G方法相比标准解码获得显著改进（7/10任务提升5-35%），且仅用一半轨迹数达到相当精度。

Conclusion: MoT-G通过保持更高的隐藏状态熵和促进token空间探索来提升推理性能，证明了在RLVR中利用分布信息的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading
approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most
current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which
samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and
adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample
discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional
information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens.
While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven
beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily
constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To
address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in
RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G
approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture
embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate
directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought.
Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive
language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements
(5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the
Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of
trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive
hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's
benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy
throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

### [10] [Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation: Improving Classifier Accuracy with Train-Time-Only Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21487)
*Jillian Xu,Dylan Zhou,Vinay Shukla,Yang Yang,Junrui Ruan,Shuhuai Lin,Wenfei Zou,Yinxiao Liu,Karthik Lakshmanan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD)方法，通过添加分类头和推理头，在训练时利用教师推理，测试时只使用分类头，实现了准确率提升同时保持高推理吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought (CoT)提示在提高分类准确率的同时引入显著吞吐量惩罚的问题，需要在准确率和效率之间找到平衡。

Method: DHRD为仅解码器语言模型添加两个头：(1)池化分类头用于训练和推理，(2)推理头仅在训练时受教师推理监督。使用标签交叉熵和输入加推理序列的token级语言模型损失的加权和进行训练。

Result: 在七个SuperGLUE任务上，DHRD相比池化基线获得0.65-5.47%的相对提升，在蕴含/因果任务上提升更显著。推理时禁用推理头，吞吐量与池化分类器相当，比相同骨干网络的CoT解码快96-142倍。

Conclusion: DHRD方法成功解决了CoT提示的准确率与效率权衡问题，实现了准确率提升的同时保持高推理效率。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting often improves classification accuracy, but
it introduces a significant throughput penalty with rationale generation (Wei
et al., 2022; Cheng and Van Durme, 2024). To resolve this trade-off, we
introduce Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD), a simple training method for
decoder-only language models (LMs) that adds (i) a pooled classification head
used during training and inference and (ii) a reasoning head supervised by
teacher rationales used only in training. We train with a loss function that is
a weighted sum of label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss over
input-plus-rationale sequences. On seven SuperGLUE tasks, DHRD yields relative
gains of 0.65-5.47% over pooled baselines, with notably larger gains on
entailment/causal tasks. Since we disable the reasoning head at test time,
inference throughput matches pooled classifiers and exceeds CoT decoding on the
same backbones by 96-142 times in QPS.

### [11] [On Code-Induced Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21499)
*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Carolyn Rosé,Daphne Ippolito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过系统实验发现，代码的结构特性比语义特性对LLM推理能力更重要，适当的抽象（如伪代码）可以替代真实代码，且表面规律比语义准确性更能维持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究代码的哪些方面（结构或语义）对提升大语言模型推理能力最为关键，为设计更有效的训练数据提供指导。

Method: 构建十种编程语言的并行指令数据集，应用受控扰动选择性破坏代码的结构或语义特性，在5个模型家族和8个规模上进行了3,331次实验。

Result: LLM对结构扰动比语义扰动更敏感；伪代码和流程图等抽象形式与真实代码效果相当；即使语义错误的代码，只要表面规律保持，性能仍具竞争力；不同编程语言风格影响任务表现。

Conclusion: 代码的结构特性是提升LLM推理能力的关键因素，适当的抽象可以替代真实代码，这为设计高效的训练数据提供了新思路。

Abstract: Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most
responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric
framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming
languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt
structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five
model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance
on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our
results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than
semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions
like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the
same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can
often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with
misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist.
Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring
natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust
favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into
how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of
training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度是农业经济国家，农民需要及时获取农业实践信息以实现最佳农业增长和产出。

Method: 基于句子嵌入模型构建聊天机器人，通过消除同义词和纳入实体提取来提高准确性。

Result: 系统准确率从初始的56%提升到86%，可24/7通过任何电子设备访问，为农民提供易于理解的农业信息。

Conclusion: 该系统有助于农民更容易获取农业实践信息，提高农业产出，同时减轻呼叫中心工作人员负担，让他们专注于更有价值的工作。

Abstract: India is an agro-based economy and proper information about agricultural
practices is the key to optimal agricultural growth and output. In order to
answer the queries of the farmer, we have build an agricultural chatbot based
on the dataset from Kisan Call Center. This system is robust enough to answer
queries related to weather, market rates, plant protection and government
schemes. This system is available 24* 7, can be accessed through any electronic
device and the information is delivered with the ease of understanding. The
system is based on a sentence embedding model which gives an accuracy of 56%.
After eliminating synonyms and incorporating entity extraction, the accuracy
jumps to 86%. With such a system, farmers can progress towards easier
information about farming related practices and hence a better agricultural
output. The job of the Call Center workforce would be made easier and the hard
work of various such workers can be redirected to a better goal.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了非洲口音英语说话人日志中的领域效应，发现临床对话存在一致的领域惩罚，主要源于误报和漏检错误。通过轻量级领域适应可减少错误但无法消除差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非洲口音英语说话人日志中的领域效应，特别关注临床对话与一般对话的性能差异。

Method: 评估多个生产和开源系统在一般和临床对话上的表现，使用严格的DER协议评分重叠。通过微调分割模块进行轻量级领域适应。

Result: 临床语音存在显著的领域惩罚，主要错误来源是误报和漏检，与短轮次和频繁重叠相关。领域适应可减少错误但无法完全消除差距。

Conclusion: 需要重叠感知的分割和平衡的临床资源作为实际改进方向，提出了跨领域基准、错误分解方法和易于复现的适应方案。

Abstract: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for
African-accented English. We evaluate multiple production and open systems on
general and clinical dialogues under a strict DER protocol that scores overlap.
A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant
across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms
and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test
lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on
accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our
contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach
to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation
recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation
and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps.

### [14] [Generation-Time vs. Post-hoc Citation: A Holistic Evaluation of LLM Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21557)
*Yash Saxena,Raviteja Bommireddy,Ankur Padia,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种LLM引用范式：生成时引用(G-Cite)和后处理引用(P-Cite)，发现检索是引用质量的主要驱动力，P-Cite在覆盖率和正确性间取得更好平衡，推荐高风险应用采用检索中心的P-Cite优先方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗、法律、学术和金融中，可信赖的LLM必须引用可验证的来源，因为即使是小错误也可能带来严重后果。需要明确模型应该在解码时生成引用还是在起草答案后附加引用。

Method: 引入两种引用范式：G-Cite（在单次解码中同时生成答案和引用）和P-Cite（起草答案后添加或验证引用）。在四个流行归属数据集上从零样本到高级检索增强方法进行全面评估。

Result: 结果显示覆盖率和引用正确性之间存在一致权衡，检索是两种范式中归属质量的主要驱动力。P-Cite方法实现高覆盖率且具有竞争力的正确性和中等延迟，而G-Cite方法以覆盖率和速度为代价优先考虑精确度。

Conclusion: 推荐高风险应用采用检索中心的P-Cite优先方法，为严格声明验证等精度关键场景保留G-Cite方法。

Abstract: Trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) must cite human-verifiable sources
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, academia, and finance, where
even small errors can have severe consequences. Practitioners and researchers
face a choice: let models generate citations during decoding, or let models
draft answers first and then attach appropriate citations. To clarify this
choice, we introduce two paradigms: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite), which
produces the answer and citations in one pass, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite),
which adds or verifies citations after drafting. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four
popular attribution datasets and provide evidence-based recommendations that
weigh trade-offs across use cases. Our results show a consistent trade-off
between coverage and citation correctness, with retrieval as the main driver of
attribution quality in both paradigms. P-Cite methods achieve high coverage
with competitive correctness and moderate latency, whereas G-Cite methods
prioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed. We recommend a
retrieval-centric, P-Cite-first approach for high-stakes applications,

### [15] [Comparative Personalization for Multi-document Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21562)
*Haoyuan Li,Snigdha Chaturvedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ComPSum是一个个性化多文档摘要框架，通过比较用户偏好与其他用户偏好的细粒度差异来生成个性化摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化多文档摘要需要识别用户偏好的细粒度差异，通过比较给定用户偏好与其他用户偏好来实现有效个性化。

Method: ComPSum首先通过比较用户偏好与其他用户偏好生成结构化分析，然后使用该分析指导生成个性化摘要。

Result: 在PerMSum数据集上使用AuthorMap评估框架进行评估，ComPSum优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过比较用户偏好的细粒度差异可以有效地实现个性化多文档摘要，ComPSum框架在此任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Personalized multi-document summarization (MDS) is essential for meeting
individual user preferences of writing style and content focus for summaries.
In this paper, we propose that for effective personalization, it is important
to identify fine-grained differences between users' preferences by comparing
the given user's preferences with other users' preferences.Motivated by this,
we propose ComPSum, a personalized MDS framework. It first generates a
structured analysis of a user by comparing their preferences with other users'
preferences. The generated structured analysis is then used to guide the
generation of personalized summaries. To evaluate the performance of ComPSum,
we propose AuthorMap, a fine-grained reference-free evaluation framework for
personalized MDS. It evaluates the personalization of a system based on the
authorship attribution between two personalized summaries generated for
different users. For robust evaluation of personalized MDS, we construct
PerMSum, a personalized MDS dataset in the review and news domain. We evaluate
the performance of ComPSum on PerMSum using AuthorMap, showing that it
outperforms strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了五种VLM作为形式化器的流水线，用于一次性、开放词汇和多模态PDDL形式化，在真实、多视角、低质量图像规划任务中显著优于端到端规划生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在简单多模态规划任务中表现良好，但在需要长序列动作的长时程规划任务中表现不佳。文本领域通过将规划问题转化为PDDL等正式规划语言取得了显著进展，但多模态环境中的VLM作为形式化器研究仍然稀缺。

Method: 开发了五种VLM作为形式化器的流水线，处理一次性、开放词汇和多模态PDDL形式化。在现有基准上评估，并提出了两个新基准，首次考虑真实、多视角和低质量图像的规划。

Result: VLM作为形式化器在规划任务中显著优于端到端规划生成。瓶颈在于视觉而非语言能力，因为VLM经常无法捕捉必要的完整对象关系集合。生成中间文本表示（如标题或场景图）部分补偿了性能，但增益不一致。

Conclusion: VLM作为形式化器方法在多模态规划中表现优异，但视觉能力仍是主要限制因素。中间文本表示提供了部分改进，但性能提升不一致，为未来多模态规划形式化研究留下了发展空间。

Abstract: The advancement of vision language models (VLMs) has empowered embodied
agents to accomplish simple multimodal planning tasks, but not long-horizon
ones requiring long sequences of actions. In text-only simulations,
long-horizon planning has seen significant improvement brought by repositioning
the role of LLMs. Instead of directly generating action sequences, LLMs
translate the planning domain and problem into a formal planning language like
the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which can call a formal solver
to derive the plan in a verifiable manner. In multimodal environments, research
on VLM-as-formalizer remains scarce, usually involving gross simplifications
such as predefined object vocabulary or overly similar few-shot examples. In
this work, we present a suite of five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines that tackle
one-shot, open-vocabulary, and multimodal PDDL formalization. We evaluate those
on an existing benchmark while presenting another two that for the first time
account for planning with authentic, multi-view, and low-quality images. We
conclude that VLM-as-formalizer greatly outperforms end-to-end plan generation.
We reveal the bottleneck to be vision rather than language, as VLMs often fail
to capture an exhaustive set of necessary object relations. While generating
intermediate, textual representations such as captions or scene graphs
partially compensate for the performance, their inconsistent gain leaves
headroom for future research directions on multimodal planning formalization.

*Madison Van Doren,Cory Holland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了多语言AI模型在翻译英语习语和双关语等比喻性语言时的本地化能力，发现尽管模型能生成语法正确的翻译，但在文化适应性方面仍有明显不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM翻译研究和行业基准主要关注语法准确性和词汇正确性，而忽略了文化适应性和整体本地化质量这些对实际应用至关重要的因素。

Method: 评估了87个LLM生成的电子商务营销邮件翻译，涵盖20种语言的24种区域方言，由母语评审员提供定量评分和定性反馈。

Result: 领先模型通常能生成语法正确的翻译，但文化细微的语言仍是明显需要改进的领域，经常需要大量人工修正。即使是高资源语言也经常误译比喻性表达和文字游戏。

Conclusion: 挑战了数据量是机器翻译质量最可靠预测因子的假设，引入文化适应性作为多语言LLM性能的关键决定因素，这是当前学术和行业基准中未充分探索的领域。

Abstract: This pilot study explores the localisation capabilities of state-of-the-art
multilingual AI models when translating figurative language, such as idioms and
puns, from English into a diverse range of global languages. It expands on
existing LLM translation research and industry benchmarks, which emphasise
grammatical accuracy and token-level correctness, by focusing on cultural
appropriateness and overall localisation quality - critical factors for
real-world applications like marketing and e-commerce.
  To investigate these challenges, this project evaluated a sample of 87
LLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional
dialects of 20 languages. Human reviewers fluent in each target language
provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to the
original's tone, meaning, and intended audience. Findings suggest that, while
leading models generally produce grammatically correct translations, culturally
nuanced language remains a clear area for improvement, often requiring
substantial human refinement. Notably, even high-resource global languages,
despite topping industry benchmark leaderboards, frequently mistranslated
figurative expressions and wordplay.
  This work challenges the assumption that data volume is the most reliable
predictor of machine translation quality and introduces cultural
appropriateness as a key determinant of multilingual LLM performance - an area
currently underexplored in existing academic and industry benchmarks. As a
proof of concept, this pilot highlights limitations of current multilingual AI
systems for real-world localisation use cases. Results of this pilot support
the opportunity for expanded research at greater scale to deliver generalisable
insights and inform deployment of reliable machine translation workflows in
culturally diverse contexts.

meta-policy MORL development that can improve efficiency and flexibility
through its bi-level learning paradigm, highlighting key research questions and
potential solutions for improving LLM performance.

*Yuxuan Zhu,David H. Yang,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri,Keerthiram Murugesan,Tejaswini Pedapati,Pin-Yu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OjaKV是一个KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合存储策略和在线子空间适应来减少长上下文生成的内存瓶颈，无需模型微调即可保持或提升零样本准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文大语言模型中KV缓存的内存瓶颈问题，现有静态压缩方法在数据分布变化时性能不佳。

Method: 采用混合存储策略：完整保留首尾关键token，对中间token使用基于Oja算法的在线PCA进行低秩压缩，在预填充阶段全面更新，解码阶段轻量级更新。

Result: 在高压缩比下保持或提升零样本准确率，在需要复杂推理的极长上下文基准测试中表现最佳，与FlashAttention等现代注意力模块完全兼容。

Conclusion: OjaKV为内存高效的长上下文推理提供了一个实用、即插即用的解决方案，通过在线子空间适应动态跟踪上下文变化。

Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are
constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache
required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for
instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of
4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's
weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising
direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that
performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid
storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that
not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial
first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors
for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies
low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's
algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a
comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates
during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving
context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention
modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or
even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular,
OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require
complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in
dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid
framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient
long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型的黑盒特性在关键应用领域引发透明度担忧，而现有的XAI方法在应用于语言模型时面临诸多限制，现有综述未能充分捕捉语言模型架构多样性和演进能力带来的独特挑战。

Method: 根据底层Transformer架构（仅编码器、仅解码器、编码器-解码器）对XAI技术进行分类整理，分析每种架构下方法的适应情况，并通过合理性和忠实性双重标准评估技术效果。

Result: 提供了针对不同语言模型架构的XAI技术结构化分析，揭示了各种方法的优势和局限性，为开发更透明可解释的语言模型提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 识别了开放研究挑战并规划了未来发展方向，旨在指导开发鲁棒、透明、可解释的语言模型XAI方法。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing
and enabled remarkable progress across diverse domains, yet their black-box
nature raises critical concerns about the interpretability of their internal
mechanisms and decision-making processes. This lack of transparency is
particularly problematic for adoption in high-stakes domains, where
stakeholders need to understand the rationale behind model outputs to ensure
accountability. On the other hand, while explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) methods have been well studied for non-LMs, they face many limitations
when applied to LMs due to their complex architectures, considerable training
corpora, and broad generalization abilities. Although various surveys have
examined XAI in the context of LMs, they often fail to capture the distinct
challenges arising from the architectural diversity and evolving capabilities
of these models. To bridge this gap, this survey presents a comprehensive
review of XAI techniques with a particular emphasis on LMs, organizing them
according to their underlying transformer architectures: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder, and analyzing how methods are adapted to
each while assessing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore,
we evaluate these techniques through the dual lenses of plausibility and
faithfulness, offering a structured perspective on their effectiveness.
Finally, we identify open research challenges and outline promising future
directions, aiming to guide ongoing efforts toward the development of robust,
transparent, and interpretable XAI methods for LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI会议投稿量激增，同行评审质量下降，需要可靠检测低质量评审中的错误信息点。

Method: 定义错误信息评审点，构建专家标注数据集，提出自动化引擎重构弱点前提，使用8个SOTA LLM评估ReviewScore并与人类专家比较。

Result: 验证了15.2%的弱点和26.4%的问题是错误信息的，LLM与人类在ReviewScore评估上达到中等一致性，前提级事实性评估比弱点级评估一致性更高。

Conclusion: 自动化ReviewScore评估具有潜力，前提级事实性评估是提高准确性的关键方向。

Abstract: Peer review serves as a backbone of academic research, but in most AI
conferences, the review quality is degrading as the number of submissions
explodes. To reliably detect low-quality reviews, we define misinformed review
points as either "weaknesses" in a review that contain incorrect premises, or
"questions" in a review that can be already answered by the paper. We verify
that 15.2% of weaknesses and 26.4% of questions are misinformed and introduce
ReviewScore indicating if a review point is misinformed. To evaluate the
factuality of each premise of weaknesses, we propose an automated engine that
reconstructs every explicit and implicit premise from a weakness. We build a
human expert-annotated ReviewScore dataset to check the ability of LLMs to
automate ReviewScore evaluation. Then, we measure human-model agreements on
ReviewScore using eight current state-of-the-art LLMs and verify moderate
agreements. We also prove that evaluating premise-level factuality shows
significantly higher agreements than evaluating weakness-level factuality. A
thorough disagreement analysis further supports a potential of fully automated
ReviewScore evaluation.

Motivation: 现有图增强生成方法面临根本性权衡：图方法依赖高质量图结构，但手动构建成本高昂，自动提取受限于LLM提取器性能，特别是使用轻量级本地模型时。

Method: 采用多智能体系统（构造器、检索器、反射器、响应器），通过演化查询和演化子图双演化机制，在推理过程中自适应构建目标图索引，实现精确证据检索。

Result: 实验表明ToG-3在深度和广度推理基准测试中优于基线方法，消融研究证实了MACER框架组件的有效性。

Conclusion: ToG-3通过动态图索引构建和双演化机制，克服了传统图RAG的静态构建限制，即使使用轻量级LLM也能实现深度精确推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the
important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external
knowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While
graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,
they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge
graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted
graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM
extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper
presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces
Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these
limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of
a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly
incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving
Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical
limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static
graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A
multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser
agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,
answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and
subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively
build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent
drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise
reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning
benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of
MACER framework.

Conclusion: 结合主动性和个性化具有前景，ProPerAssistant展示了通过用户反馈持续学习和适应的能力，能够提高用户满意度。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily
life, there is growing demand for AI assistants that are not only reactive but
also proactive and personalized. While recent advances have pushed forward
proactivity and personalization individually, their combination remains
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProPerSim, a new task and
simulation framework for developing assistants capable of making timely,
personalized recommendations in realistic home scenarios. In our simulation
environment, a user agent with a rich persona interacts with the assistant,
providing ratings on how well each suggestion aligns with its preferences and
context. The assistant's goal is to use these ratings to learn and adapt to
achieve higher scores over time. Built on ProPerSim, we propose
ProPerAssistant, a retrieval-augmented, preference-aligned assistant that
continually learns and adapts through user feedback. Experiments across 32
diverse personas show that ProPerAssistant adapts its strategy and steadily
improves user satisfaction, highlighting the promise of uniting proactivity and
personalization.

Motivation: 在工业环境中，LLM处理长上下文问答时面临高计算成本和延迟的挑战，特别是在需要基于相同上下文回答多个问题的情况下。

Method: 进行了广泛的实验，对一系列专有和开源模型在这一挑战性任务上进行了基准测试。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA) over
lengthy contexts is a significant challenge. In industrial settings, this
process is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, especially
when multiple questions must be answered based on the same context. In this
work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to answer multiple questions based on
the same conversational context. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark
a range of both proprietary and public models on this challenging task. Our
findings highlight that while strong proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o achieve the
best overall performance, fine-tuned public LLMs with up to 8 billion
parameters can surpass GPT-4o in accuracy, which demonstrates their potential
for transparent and cost-effective deployment in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Speculative Biased Decoding方法，用于流式应用中的同时翻译，通过重用最近输出作为草稿并偏向草稿标记来加速推理，减少闪烁，无需额外草稿计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在流式应用（如实时翻译）中需要持续更新输出但计算成本高的问题，避免重复从头生成输出。

Method: 使用最近输出作为当前扩展输入的草稿，在验证阶段偏向草稿标记以提高接受率，结合显示掩码技术减少闪烁。

Result: 在同时文本重翻译任务中实现1.7倍加速，质量无损，闪烁减少80%。

Conclusion: 该方法为延迟敏感的流式应用提供了模型无关、即插即用的加速解决方案，无需草稿计算。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging
to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation),
where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while
still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency
requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous
translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference
paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a
consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a
draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the
output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance
rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but
also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the
point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end
condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the
need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play
solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications.
Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate
that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional
auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it
significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only
mask-k technique.

TL;DR: TwS框架通过音频链式思维（Audio CoT）增强大型音频语言模型，使其能够在复杂声学场景中进行音频推理，显著提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型音频语言模型在复杂声学场景下的音频推理任务表现不佳，缺乏对音频工具（如噪声抑制、源分离等）的访问能力。

Method: 提出Thinking-with-Sound框架，结合语言推理和实时音频域分析，实现音频信号的数值分析和数字处理。

Result: 在MELD-Hard1k基准测试中，TwS显著提升模型鲁棒性：小型模型准确率提升24.73%，大型模型提升36.61%。

Conclusion: Audio CoT无需重新训练即可显著增强模型鲁棒性，为开发更鲁棒的音频理解系统开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have shown strong performance on
various audio understanding tasks such as speech translation and Audio Q\&A.
However, they exhibit significant limitations on challenging audio reasoning
tasks in complex acoustic scenarios. These situations would greatly benefit
from the use of acoustic tools like noise suppression, source separation, and
precise temporal alignment, but current LALMs lack access to such tools. To
address this limitation, we introduce Thinking-with-Sound (TwS), a framework
that equips LALMs with Audio CoT by combining linguistic reasoning with
on-the-fly audio-domain analysis. Unlike existing approaches that treat audio
as static input, TwS enables models to actively think with audio signals,
performing numerical analysis and digital manipulation through multimodal
reasoning. To evaluate this approach, we construct MELD-Hard1k, a new
robustness benchmark created by introducing various acoustic perturbations.
Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LALMs suffer dramatic performance
degradation on MELD-Hard1k, with accuracy dropping by more than $50\%$ compared
to clean audio. TwS achieves substantial improvements in robustness,
demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability: small models gain $24.73\%$
absolute accuracy, with improvements scaling consistently up to $36.61\%$ for
larger models. Our findings demonstrate that Audio CoT can significantly
enhance robustness without retraining, opening new directions for developing
more robust audio understanding systems.

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了单一生成基础模型在工业级统一信息访问中的可行性。

Abstract: The dominant retrieve-then-rank pipeline in large-scale recommender systems
suffers from mis-calibration and engineering overhead due to its architectural
split and differing optimization objectives. While recent generative sequence
models have shown promise in unifying retrieval and ranking by
auto-regressively generating ranked items, existing solutions typically address
either personalized search or query-free recommendation, often exhibiting
performance trade-offs when attempting to unify both. We introduce
\textit{SynerGen}, a novel generative recommender model that bridges this
critical gap by providing a single generative backbone for both personalized
search and recommendation, while simultaneously excelling at retrieval and
ranking tasks. Trained on behavioral sequences, our decoder-only Transformer
leverages joint optimization with InfoNCE for retrieval and a hybrid
pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking, allowing semantic signals from search to
improve recommendation and vice versa. We also propose a novel time-aware
rotary positional embedding to effectively incorporate time information into
the attention mechanism. \textit{SynerGen} achieves significant improvements on
widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong
generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines. This work
demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for
industrial-scale unified information access.

TL;DR: 使用因果推断分析结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响，发现粗粒度指标显示正负或中性效应，但因果推断显示48个场景中43个无因果影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究对结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响存在矛盾结论，且评估存在测试场景受限、比较设置控制弱、依赖粗粒度指标等局限

Method: 基于一个假设和两个保证约束，推导五种潜在因果结构，在七个公开和一个自建推理任务上进行因果推断分析

Result: 粗粒度指标报告结构化输出对GPT-4o生成有正、负或中性影响，但因果推断显示48个场景中43个无因果影响，剩余5个中3个涉及由具体指令影响的多方面因果结构

Conclusion: 结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响可能被先前研究高估，因果推断提供了更精确的分析框架

Abstract: Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency
in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial
applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output
on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest
that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others
argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions
in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments
include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings,
and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis
using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we
derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of
structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2)
collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from
output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed
reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or
neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal
inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining
5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete
instructions.

TL;DR: 提出了CARB基准来评估奖励模型的文化意识，发现现有模型存在缺陷，并提出了Think-as-Locals方法来改进文化意识奖励建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型评估缺乏文化意识评估数据集，需要填补这一空白以推进LLM的全球对齐。

Method: 构建了CARB基准覆盖10种文化和4个文化领域，提出了Think-as-Locals方法，通过RLVR激发更深层的文化推理。

Result: 评估显示现有奖励模型在文化意识建模方面存在不足，CARB性能与下游多语言文化对齐任务正相关，Think-as-Locals能有效缓解虚假特征干扰。

Conclusion: CARB基准有效评估文化意识，Think-as-Locals方法能显著提升文化意识奖励建模性能。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is
essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM
evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of
culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural
Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures
across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs
reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a
positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual
cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations
within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly
on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding.
To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally
grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate
preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria
generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious
features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出在同步机器翻译中扩展动作空间，引入四种自适应动作来改善实时翻译的质量和延迟问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码器-解码器策略的READ/WRITE动作无法充分解决同步机器翻译在严格实时约束下的高质量翻译需求

Method: 在仅解码器的大语言模型框架中实现四种自适应动作，通过动作感知提示构建训练参考，并使用延迟感知TTS管道评估质量和延迟

Result: 在ACL60/60英中和英德基准测试中，该框架持续提升语义指标并降低延迟，特别是DROP和SENTENCE_CUT组合在流畅性和延迟间达到最佳平衡

Conclusion: 丰富基于LLM的同步机器翻译动作空间为弥合人机翻译差距提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations
under strict real-time constraints, which traditional encoder-decoder policies
with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space
of SiMT with four adaptive actions: SENTENCE_CUT, DROP, PARTIAL_SUMMARIZATION
and PRONOMINALIZATION, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and
simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We implement these actions
in a decoder-only large language model (LLM) framework and construct training
references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and
latency, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual
outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60
English-Chinese and English-German benchmarks show that our framework
consistently improves semantic metrics (e.g., COMET-KIWI) and achieves lower
delay (measured by Average Lagging) compared to reference translations and
salami-based baselines. Notably, combining DROP and SENTENCE_CUT yields the
best overall balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate
that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising
direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

TL;DR: 提出CaMIB模型，通过因果多模态信息瓶颈解决传统多模态学习中因数据集偏差导致的OOD泛化问题，使用信息瓶颈过滤噪声，分离因果和捷径特征，并引入工具变量约束和后门调整来稳定因果估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于"学习注意力"的多模态学习方法容易受到数据集偏差影响，将统计捷径与真实因果特征混淆，导致分布外泛化能力下降。

Method: 应用信息瓶颈过滤单模态输入中的任务无关噪声；使用参数化掩码生成器将融合的多模态表示解耦为因果和捷径子表示；引入工具变量约束确保因果特征全局一致性；采用后门调整通过随机重组因果和捷径特征来稳定因果估计。

Result: 在多模态情感分析、幽默检测和讽刺检测任务上进行了广泛实验，包括OOD测试集，证明了CaMIB的有效性。

Conclusion: 理论和实证分析表明CaMIB具有可解释性和合理性，能够有效提升多模态语言理解的OOD泛化能力。

Abstract: Human Multimodal Language Understanding (MLU) aims to infer human intentions
by integrating related cues from heterogeneous modalities. Existing works
predominantly follow a ``learning to attend" paradigm, which maximizes mutual
information between data and labels to enhance predictive performance. However,
such methods are vulnerable to unintended dataset biases, causing models to
conflate statistical shortcuts with genuine causal features and resulting in
degraded out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To alleviate this issue, we
introduce a Causal Multimodal Information Bottleneck (CaMIB) model that
leverages causal principles rather than traditional likelihood. Concretely, we
first applies the information bottleneck to filter unimodal inputs, removing
task-irrelevant noise. A parameterized mask generator then disentangles the
fused multimodal representation into causal and shortcut subrepresentations. To
ensure global consistency of causal features, we incorporate an instrumental
variable constraint, and further adopt backdoor adjustment by randomly
recombining causal and shortcut features to stabilize causal estimation.
Extensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis, humor detection, and
sarcasm detection, along with OOD test sets, demonstrate the effectiveness of
CaMIB. Theoretical and empirical analyses further highlight its
interpretability and soundness.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a combination of novel and exciting tasks: the
solution and generation of linguistic puzzles. We focus on puzzles used in
Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. We first extend the existing
benchmark for the task of solving linguistic puzzles. We explore the use of
Large Language Models (LLMs), including recent state-of-the-art models such as
OpenAI's o1, for solving linguistic puzzles, analyzing their performance across
various linguistic topics. We demonstrate that LLMs outperform humans on most
puzzles types, except for those centered on writing systems, and for the
understudied languages. We use the insights from puzzle-solving experiments to
direct the novel task of puzzle generation. We believe that automating puzzle
generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding
interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience. This
finding highlights the importance of linguistic puzzle generation as a research
task: such puzzles can not only promote linguistics but also support the
dissemination of knowledge about rare and understudied languages.

TL;DR: 提出了ResT方法，通过熵感知的token重加权来重塑策略梯度，优化大语言模型在工具使用任务中的训练效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习框架在优化工具使用策略时仅依赖稀疏结果奖励，缺乏对工具使用任务特殊性的考虑，导致策略梯度方差大、训练效率低。

Method: ResT通过熵感知的token重加权来重塑策略梯度，随着训练进行逐步增加推理token的权重，实现从结构正确性到语义推理的平滑过渡。

Result: 在BFCL和API-Bank评估中，ResT达到最先进结果，比先前方法提升高达8.76%。在4B基础LLM上微调后，ResT在单轮任务上超过GPT-4o 4.11%，在多轮基础任务上超过1.50%。

Conclusion: ResT通过熵感知的token级策略梯度，有效解决了工具使用任务中的训练不稳定问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) transcend passive generation and act as
goal-directed agents by invoking external tools. Reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a principled framework for optimizing these emergent tool-use policies,
yet the prevailing paradigm relies exclusively on sparse outcome rewards and
lacks consideration of the particularity of tool-use tasks, inflating
policy-gradient variance and resulting in inefficient training. To better
understand and address these challenges, we first establish a theoretical link
between policy entropy and training stability of tool-use tasks, which reveals
that structured, low-entropy tokens are primary determinants of rewards.
Motivated by this insight, we propose \textbf{Res}haped \textbf{T}oken-level
policy gradients (\textbf{ResT}) for tool-use tasks. ResT reshapes the policy
gradient through entropy-informed token reweighting, progressively upweighting
reasoning tokens as training proceeds. This entropy-aware scheme enables a
smooth shift from structural correctness to semantic reasoning and stabilizes
convergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks. Evaluation on BFCL and API-Bank shows
that ResT achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior methods by up
to $8.76\%$. When fine-tuned on a 4B base LLM, ResT further surpasses GPT-4o by
$4.11\%$ on single-turn tasks and $1.50\%$ on multi-turn base tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 级联系统面临在开放文本生成中判断输出可靠性的挑战，因为生成质量是连续的且存在多个有效响应

Method: 使用语义一致性作为无需训练的信令，当不同模型输出在语义层面达成共识时，将其作为可靠性指标

Result: 语义级联在500M到70B参数模型上评估，以40%的成本达到或超过目标模型质量，延迟降低达60%

Conclusion: 该方法无需模型内部信息，适用于黑盒API，对模型更新具有鲁棒性，为实际LLM部署提供了实用基准

Abstract: Cascade systems route computational requests to smaller models when possible
and defer to larger models only when necessary, offering a promising approach
to balance cost and quality in LLM deployment. However, they face a fundamental
challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when
generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid
responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level
consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable
deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their
consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence.
Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades
match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by
up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs,
and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for
real-world LLM deployment.

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在自动和基于LLM的评估中显著优于强基线模型。

Abstract: Empathetic response generation is a crucial task for creating more human-like
and supportive conversational agents. However, existing methods face a core
trade-off between the analytical depth of specialized models and the generative
fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose TRACE,
Task-decomposed Reasoning for Affective Communication and Empathy, a novel
framework that models empathy as a structured cognitive process by decomposing
the task into a pipeline for analysis and synthesis. By building a
comprehensive understanding before generation, TRACE unites deep analysis with
expressive generation. Experimental results show that our framework
significantly outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and LLM-based
evaluations, confirming that our structured decomposition is a promising
paradigm for creating more capable and interpretable empathetic agents. Our
code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TRACE-18EF/README.md.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单轮对话，而多轮对话基准通常评估其他能力而非知识密集型事实性，存在关键空白。

Method: 采用动态评估设置，让模型基于逻辑递进的问题序列生成自己的多轮对话历史，然后使用人工验证的自动化流程评估最终轮答案的事实能力和信息传递效率。

Result: 实验显示多轮上下文会降低性能：事实能力因自生成历史中的上下文噪声而下降，信息效率随对话长度增加而模型变得更冗长而降低。检索增强生成(RAG)可有效缓解甚至逆转这种事实退化。

Conclusion: 该基准对于评估和增强LLMs在现实世界知识密集型应用中的对话事实能力具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multi-Turn Long-Form Question Answering (MT-LFQA) is a key application
paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to single-turn dialogue, while
multi-turn dialogue benchmarks typically assess other orthogonal capabilities
rather than knowledge-intensive factuality. To bridge this critical gap, we
introduce \textbf{KnowMT-Bench}, the \textit{first-ever} benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate MT-LFQA for LLMs across knowledge-intensive fields,
including medicine, finance, and law. To faithfully assess the model's
real-world performance, KnowMT-Bench employs a dynamic evaluation setting where
models generate their own multi-turn dialogue histories given logically
progressive question sequences. The factual capability and information delivery
efficiency of the \textit{final-turn} answer are then evaluated using a
human-validated automated pipeline. Our experiments reveal that multi-turn
contexts degrade performance: factual capability declines due to the contextual
noise from self-generated histories, while information efficiency drops as
models become more verbose with increasing dialogue length. We then investigate
mitigation strategies, demonstrating that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
can effectively alleviate and even reverse this factual degradation. These
findings underscore the importance of our benchmark in evaluating and enhancing
the conversational factual capabilities of LLMs in real-world
knowledge-intensive applications. Code is available at

Motivation: LoRA的线性特性限制了其表达能力，需要非线性扩展来提升性能。

Method: 提出LoRAN方法，对低秩更新应用轻量级变换，并引入基于正弦的Sinter激活函数。

Result: 在摘要和分类任务上的实验表明，LoRAN始终优于QLoRA，Sinter激活函数在消融研究中优于Sigmoid、ReLU和Tanh等标准激活函数。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计在低秩调优中具有重要意义，LoRAN通过非线性扩展有效提升了LoRA的性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient

expressiveness. We propose LoRAN, a non-linear extension of LoRA that applies
lightweight transformations to the low-rank updates. We further introduce
Sinter, a sine-based activation that adds structured perturbations without
increasing parameter count. Experiments across summarization and classification
tasks show that LoRAN consistently improves over QLoRA. Ablation studies reveal
that Sinter outperforms standard activations such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh,
highlighting the importance of activation design in lowrank tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统即使提供了正确和充分的上下文，仍然会产生幻觉。现有方法需要大量超参数调优，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 通过分布距离量化外部上下文利用，通过跟踪transformer层中预测token的演化来测量内部知识利用，并引入统计验证框架。

Result: 在常见RAG幻觉基准测试和四个开源LLM上，LUMINA实现了持续高的AUROC和AUPRC分数，在HalluRAG上比现有方法提升高达+13% AUROC。

Conclusion: LUMINA在检索质量和模型匹配的宽松假设下保持稳健，提供了有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large
language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet,
RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient
context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance
between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and
several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination
detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning,
limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that
detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals:
external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while
internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens
evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for
statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG
hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves
consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based
methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under
relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both
effectiveness and practicality.

TL;DR: RL-ZVP是一种新的强化学习算法，能够从零方差提示中提取学习信号，在数学推理基准上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO只关注响应正确性不同的提示，而忽略了所有响应获得相同奖励的零方差提示，这些提示实际上也包含有用的学习信号。

Method: RL-ZVP通过直接奖励正确性和惩罚错误来从零方差提示中提取学习信号，使用token级特征调节反馈以保留信息丰富的细微信号。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，RL-ZVP相比GRPO在准确率上提升高达8.61个百分点，通过率提升7.77个百分点，且始终优于过滤零方差提示的基线方法。

Conclusion: 零方差提示在RLVR中具有未被开发的潜力，RL-ZVP证明了从这些提示中学习的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework
for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to
the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses
receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we
argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful
feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with
Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals
from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes
errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level
characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math
reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61
points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently
outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These
results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts
in RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型评估方法仅关注输出正确性，忽视了用户满意度来自响应质量和交互过程的相互作用，无法解释用户体验的底层机制。

Method: 引入QoNext框架，识别影响用户体验的因素，在受控实验中收集不同配置下的人类评分，构建QoE导向数据库并训练预测模型。

Result: QoNext不仅实现了主动和细粒度的评估，还为产品化服务提供了优化基础模型的可操作指导。

Conclusion: QoNext成功将QoE原则应用于基础模型评估，填补了现有方法在用户体验评估方面的空白，为实践中的模型优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Existing evaluations of foundation models, including recent human-centric
approaches, fail to capture what truly matters: user's experience during
interaction. Current methods treat evaluation as a matter of output correctness
alone, overlooking that user satisfaction emerges from the interplay between
response quality and interaction, which limits their ability to account for the
mechanisms underlying user experience. To address this gap, we introduce
QoNext, the first framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles
from networking and multimedia to the assessment of foundation models. QoNext
identifies experiential factors that shape user experience and incorporates
them into controlled experiments, where human ratings are collected under
varied configurations. From these studies we construct a QoE-oriented database
and train predictive models that estimate perceived user experience from
measurable system parameters. Our results demonstrate that QoNext not only
enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation but also provides actionable
guidance for productized services of optimizing foundation models in practice.

TL;DR: 提出Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE)训练框架，解决MoE模型在推理时增加激活专家数导致性能下降的问题，显著扩展性能扩展范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型在训练和推理时固定激活专家数，但直觉上推理时激活更多专家应提升性能。研究发现性能在轻微增加专家数后迅速下降，这源于专家间缺乏学习协作。

Method: 引入EMoE训练框架，同时训练专家在多样化组合中协作，并鼓励路由器进行高质量选择，确保在不同计算预算下推理时的稳健性能。

Result: 实验表明EMoE显著扩展有效性能扩展范围，可达训练时k值的2-3倍，同时将模型峰值性能推向更高水平。

Conclusion: EMoE通过促进专家协作和路由器优化，成功解决了MoE模型在推理时扩展专家数的性能下降问题，实现了更灵活的推理计算预算适应。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically fix the number of activated experts
$k$ at both training and inference. Intuitively, activating more experts at
inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters
for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However,
contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that
performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the
number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems
from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we
introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that
enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference
without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training
experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for
high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational
budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings.
Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective
performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\times$ the
training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对土耳其语等黏着性语言的引用意图分类问题，提出了系统化方法并创建了首个土耳其语引用意图数据集。通过DSPy框架构建可编程分类管道，采用堆叠泛化集成方法，最终达到91.3%的最优准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土耳其语等黏着性语言的引用意图理解对学术研究评估至关重要，但现有方法在处理这类语言时面临独特挑战，需要专门的数据集和分类框架。

Method: 1) 创建新的土耳其语引用意图公开数据集；2) 使用DSPy框架构建可编程分类管道，自动优化提示；3) 采用堆叠泛化集成方法，以XGBoost作为元模型聚合多个优化模型的输出。

Result: 提出的集成方法达到了91.3%的最优准确率，显著优于标准上下文学习方法，解决了手动设计提示导致的结果不一致问题。

Conclusion: 本研究为土耳其NLP社区和更广泛的学术界提供了基础数据集和稳健的分类框架，为未来的定性引用研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding the qualitative intent of citations is essential for a
comprehensive assessment of academic research, a task that poses unique
challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish. This paper introduces a
systematic methodology and a foundational dataset to address this problem. We
first present a new, publicly available dataset of Turkish citation intents,
created with a purpose-built annotation tool. We then evaluate the performance
of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs),
demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused
by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a
programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which
automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we
employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple
optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with
an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\%.
Ultimately, this study provides the Turkish NLP community and the broader
academic circles with a foundational dataset and a robust classification
framework paving the way for future qualitative citation studies.

### [44] [AutoSCORE: Enhancing Automated Scoring with Multi-Agent Large Language Models via Structured Component Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21910)
*Yun Wang,Zhaojun Ding,Xuansheng Wu,Siyue Sun,Ninghao Liu,Xiaoming Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSCORE是一个多代理LLM框架，通过评分标准对齐的结构化组件识别来提升自动评分性能，解决了传统LLM评分中的准确性低、提示敏感性、可解释性差和评分标准不对齐等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM作为端到端评分器面临的挑战，包括低准确性、提示敏感性、有限可解释性和评分标准不对齐，这些限制了LLM在自动评分实践中的应用。

Method: 提出AutoSCORE框架，包含两个代理：评分标准组件提取代理从学生回答中提取相关组件并编码为结构化表示，评分代理使用该表示分配最终分数，确保模型推理遵循类似人类的评分过程。

Result: 在ASAP基准的四个数据集上评估，使用GPT-4o、LLaMA-3.1-8B和LLaMA-3.1-70B模型，AutoSCORE在评分准确性、人机一致性（QWK、相关性）和误差指标（MAE、RMSE）上均优于单代理基线，特别是在复杂多维评分标准和小型LLM上表现突出。

Conclusion: 结构化组件识别与多代理设计相结合，为自动评分提供了可扩展、可靠且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated scoring plays a crucial role in education by reducing the reliance
on human raters, offering scalable and immediate evaluation of student work.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in this task,
their use as end-to-end raters faces challenges such as low accuracy, prompt
sensitivity, limited interpretability, and rubric misalignment. These issues
hinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment
practice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM
framework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent
REcognition. With two agents, AutoSCORE first extracts rubric-relevant
components from student responses and encodes them into a structured
representation (i.e., Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent), which is then
used to assign final scores (i.e., Scoring Agent). This design ensures that
model reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing
interpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark
datasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs
(GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B). Across diverse tasks and rubrics,
AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK,
correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent
baselines, with particularly strong benefits on complex, multi-dimensional
rubrics, and especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs. These results
demonstrate that structured component recognition combined with multi-agent
design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated
scoring.

TL;DR: 提出了SimulSense框架，通过模仿人类译员感知意义单元的方式，在连续读取语音输入的同时触发写入决策，实现更优质的质量-延迟权衡和实时效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有SimulST系统需要专门训练数据和依赖计算昂贵的LLM推理的问题，模仿人类译员的读写决策机制。

Method: 提出SimulSense框架，通过连续读取输入语音并在感知到新意义单元时触发写入决策来产生翻译。

Result: 相比两种最先进的基线系统，该方法实现了更优的质量-延迟权衡，决策速度比基线快9.6倍。

Conclusion: SimulSense框架能够高效模仿人类译员的决策过程，在保持翻译质量的同时显著提升实时效率。

Abstract: How to make human-interpreter-like read/write decisions for simultaneous
speech translation (SimulST) systems? Current state-of-the-art systems
formulate SimulST as a multi-turn dialogue task, requiring specialized
interleaved training data and relying on computationally expensive large
language model (LLM) inference for decision-making. In this paper, we propose
SimulSense, a novel framework for SimulST that mimics human interpreters by
continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions to produce
translation when a new sense unit is perceived. Experiments against two
state-of-the-art baseline systems demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
a superior quality-latency tradeoff and substantially improved real-time
efficiency, where its decision-making is up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.

### [46] [Why Chain of Thought Fails in Clinical Text Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21933)
*Jiageng Wu,Kevin Xie,Bowen Gu,Nils Krüger,Kueiyu Joshua Lin,Jie Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次大规模系统评估了思维链提示在临床文本理解中的效果，发现86.3%的LLM在CoT设置下性能下降，揭示了临床领域CoT增强可解释性但可能损害可靠性的关键悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在临床护理中的应用日益增多，但思维链提示在临床文本理解中的有效性尚未得到充分探索，特别是在处理冗长、碎片化和嘈杂的电子健康记录时。

Method: 评估95个先进LLM在87个真实世界临床文本任务上的表现，涵盖9种语言和8种任务类型，通过细粒度分析推理长度、医学术语对齐和错误模式，结合LLM评估和临床专家评估。

Result: 与其它领域不同，86.3%的模型在CoT设置下出现性能下降，能力更强的模型相对稳健，而较弱模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: CoT在临床文本任务中增强可解释性但可能损害可靠性，为LLM的临床推理策略提供了实证基础，强调了透明可信方法的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care,
a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe
and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits
step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and
interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in
clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of
electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation,
which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the
first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We
assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9
languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we
observe that 86.3\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the
CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones
suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform
fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error
profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert
evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails
in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances
interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This
work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs,
highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches.

*Kasidit Sermsri,Teerapong Panboonyuen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ThaiFACTUAL框架，通过反事实数据增强和基于理由的监督来减轻LLMs在泰语政治立场检测中的偏见，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源和文化复杂的泰语政治环境中，LLMs存在系统性偏见（如情感泄漏和实体偏好），影响公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用反事实数据增强和基于理由的监督，分离情感与立场，减少偏见。发布了首个高质量泰语政治立场数据集。

Result: ThaiFACTUAL显著减少了虚假相关性，增强了零样本泛化能力，并提高了多个LLMs的公平性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了针对代表性不足语言的文化基础去偏见技术的重要性。

Abstract: Political stance detection in low-resource and culturally complex settings
poses a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). In the Thai
political landscape - marked by indirect language, polarized figures, and
entangled sentiment and stance - LLMs often display systematic biases such as
sentiment leakage and favoritism toward entities. These biases undermine
fairness and reliability. We present ThaiFACTUAL, a lightweight, model-agnostic
calibration framework that mitigates political bias without requiring
fine-tuning. ThaiFACTUAL uses counterfactual data augmentation and
rationale-based supervision to disentangle sentiment from stance and reduce
bias. We also release the first high-quality Thai political stance dataset,
annotated with stance, sentiment, rationales, and bias markers across diverse
entities and events. Experimental results show that ThaiFACTUAL significantly
reduces spurious correlations, enhances zero-shot generalization, and improves
fairness across multiple LLMs. This work highlights the importance of
culturally grounded debiasing techniques for underrepresented languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MotivGraph-SoIQ框架，通过整合动机知识图谱和苏格拉底对话来增强LLM的学术创意生成能力，解决创意落地和确认偏误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在加速学术创意生成方面潜力巨大，但面临创意落地困难和确认偏误的挑战，需要改进以支持创意的进一步精炼。

Method: 整合动机知识图谱（存储问题、挑战和解决方案三种节点类型）和Q驱动的苏格拉底创意生成器（双代理系统），通过苏格拉底提问促进严格的精炼过程。

Result: 在ICLR25论文主题数据集上，MotivGraph-SoIQ在基于LLM的评分、ELO排名和人工评估指标上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过提供必要的落地支持和实用的创意改进步骤，显著提升了LLM创意生成的创意新颖性、实验严谨性和动机合理性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold substantial potential for accelerating
academic ideation but face critical challenges in grounding ideas and
mitigating confirmation bias for further refinement. We propose integrating
motivational knowledge graphs and socratic dialogue to address these
limitations in enhanced LLM ideation (MotivGraph-SoIQ). This novel framework
provides essential grounding and practical idea improvement steps for LLM
ideation by integrating a Motivational Knowledge Graph (MotivGraph) with a
Q-Driven Socratic Ideator. The MotivGraph structurally stores three key node
types(problem, challenge and solution) to offer motivation grounding for the
LLM ideation process. The Ideator is a dual-agent system utilizing Socratic
questioning, which facilitates a rigorous refinement process that mitigates
confirmation bias and improves idea quality across novelty, experimental rigor,
and motivational rationality dimensions. On the ICLR25 paper topics dataset,
MotivGraph-SoIQ exhibits clear advantages over existing state-of-the-art
approaches across LLM-based scoring, ELO ranking, and human evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的简单黑盒幻觉检测方法，通过分析LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为模式来检测事实性错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法需要外部资源或LLMs内部状态，但在API受限和外部资源有限的情况下，急需建立有效的黑盒检测方法

Method: 通过研究LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为，发现事实性回答具有一致性，非事实性回答不一致，基于此设计黑盒检测指标

Result: 实验表明该指标在预测模型回答事实性方面优于使用LLMs内部知识的基线方法

Conclusion: 提出的基于不确定性的黑盒检测方法能有效识别LLMs的幻觉问题，且不需要访问模型内部状态

Abstract: Despite the great advancement of Language modeling in recent days, Large
Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3 are notorious for generating non-factual
responses, so-called "hallucination" problems. Existing methods for detecting
and alleviating this hallucination problem require external resources or the
internal state of LLMs, such as the output probability of each token. Given the
LLM's restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external
resources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the
cornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a
simple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the
behavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty. Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that LLMs generate consistent responses when they present factual
responses while non-consistent responses vice versa. Based on the analysis, we
propose an efficient black-box hallucination detection metric with the
expression of uncertainty. The experiment demonstrates that our metric is more
predictive of the factuality in model responses than baselines that use
internal knowledge of LLMs.

TL;DR: GraphSearch是一种新颖的图检索增强生成方法，通过双通道检索策略和模块化框架解决传统GraphRAG的浅层检索和结构数据利用不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法存在两个核心限制：浅层检索无法获取所有关键证据，以及预构建结构图数据利用效率低，阻碍复杂查询的有效推理。

Method: 提出GraphSearch，采用代理深度搜索工作流程和双通道检索策略，包含六个模块的模块化框架，支持多轮交互和迭代推理。双通道检索包括基于分块文本数据的语义查询和基于结构图数据的关系查询。

Result: 在六个多跳RAG基准测试上的实验结果表明，GraphSearch相比传统策略在答案准确性和生成质量方面持续提升。

Conclusion: GraphSearch是推进图检索增强生成的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances factual reasoning in
LLMs by structurally modeling knowledge through graph-based representations.
However, existing GraphRAG approaches face two core limitations: shallow
retrieval that fails to surface all critical evidence, and inefficient
utilization of pre-constructed structural graph data, which hinders effective
reasoning from complex queries. To address these challenges, we propose
\textsc{GraphSearch}, a novel agentic deep searching workflow with dual-channel
retrieval for GraphRAG. \textsc{GraphSearch} organizes the retrieval process
into a modular framework comprising six modules, enabling multi-turn
interactions and iterative reasoning. Furthermore, \textsc{GraphSearch} adopts
a dual-channel retrieval strategy that issues semantic queries over chunk-based
text data and relational queries over structural graph data, enabling
comprehensive utilization of both modalities and their complementary strengths.
Experimental results across six multi-hop RAG benchmarks demonstrate that
\textsc{GraphSearch} consistently improves answer accuracy and generation
quality over the traditional strategy, confirming \textsc{GraphSearch} as a
promising direction for advancing graph retrieval-augmented generation.

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，主题建模中常被视为噪声的异常值实际上是新兴主题的弱信号，通过向量嵌入和累积聚类方法，在法语和英语新闻数据集中观察到异常值随时间演变成连贯主题的模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题建模通常将异常值视为噪声而忽略，但本研究认为这些异常值可能包含新兴主题的早期信号，特别是在动态新闻语料库中。

Method: 使用最先进语言模型的向量嵌入和累积聚类方法，在法语和英语新闻数据集（重点关注企业社会责任和气候变化）中跟踪异常值的时间演化。

Result: 结果显示出一致的模式：异常值倾向于随时间演变成连贯的主题，这一发现在不同模型和语言中都得到了验证。

Conclusion: 异常值不应被简单地视为噪声，而是新兴主题的早期指示器，这对动态文本分析具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper examines how outliers, often dismissed as noise in topic modeling,
can act as weak signals of emerging topics in dynamic news corpora. Using
vector embeddings from state-of-the-art language models and a cumulative
clustering approach, we track their evolution over time in French and English
news datasets focused on corporate social responsibility and climate change.
The results reveal a consistent pattern: outliers tend to evolve into coherent
topics over time across both models and languages.

Conclusion: TACOS分类法能够有效应对临床聊天机器人应用中的安全挑战，提供了一个全面覆盖临床和非临床查询的安全框架。

Abstract: Safety is a paramount concern in clinical chatbot applications, where
inaccurate or harmful responses can lead to serious consequences. Existing
methods--such as guardrails and tool calling--often fall short in addressing
the nuanced demands of the clinical domain. In this paper, we introduce TACOS
(TAxonomy of COmprehensive Safety for Clinical Agents), a fine-grained,
21-class taxonomy that integrates safety filtering and tool selection into a
single user intent classification step. TACOS is a taxonomy that can cover a
wide spectrum of clinical and non-clinical queries, explicitly modeling varying
safety thresholds and external tool dependencies. To validate our framework, we
curate a TACOS-annotated dataset and perform extensive experiments. Our results
demonstrate the value of a new taxonomy specialized for clinical agent
settings, and reveal useful insights about train data distribution and
pretrained knowledge of base models.

Result: 在情感分析任务上的验证表明，FRC确保稳定推理并促进不同模型规模间的知识迁移。

Conclusion: FRC为管理细微和模糊表达提供了一种通用机制，具有改进的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), natural language
processing (NLP) has achieved remarkable progress. Nonetheless, significant
challenges remain in handling texts with ambiguity, polysemy, or uncertainty.
We introduce the Fuzzy Reasoning Chain (FRC) framework, which integrates LLM
semantic priors with continuous fuzzy membership degrees, creating an explicit
interaction between probability-based reasoning and fuzzy membership reasoning.
This transition allows ambiguous inputs to be gradually transformed into clear
and interpretable decisions while capturing conflicting or uncertain signals
that traditional probability-based methods cannot. We validate FRC on sentiment
analysis tasks, where both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that
it ensures stable reasoning and facilitates knowledge transfer across different
model scales. These findings indicate that FRC provides a general mechanism for
managing subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and
robustness.

Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注静态的AI生成文本检测，但社交媒体内容受用户参与度驱动且随时间演变，需要研究其时间动态和用户交互模式。

Method: 从小红书平台收集5年纵向数据，提出基于心理语言学特征的PLAD检测框架，利用可解释特征区分人类和AI生成内容。

Result: PLAD框架实现了优越的检测性能，揭示了区分人类和AI生成内容的特征签名，并发现了这些语言特征与社交媒体参与度之间的复杂关系。

Conclusion: RedNote-Vibe数据集和PLAD框架为社交媒体AI生成文本的纵向分析提供了重要工具，有助于理解AI生成内容的时间动态和用户交互模式。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to widespread
AI-Generated Text (AIGT) on social media platforms, creating unique challenges
where content dynamics are driven by user engagement and evolve over time.
However, existing datasets mainly depict static AIGT detection. In this work,
we introduce RedNote-Vibe, the first longitudinal (5-years) dataset for social
media AIGT analysis. This dataset is sourced from Xiaohongshu platform,
containing user engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments) and timestamps
spanning from the pre-LLM period to July 2025, which enables research into the
temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AIGT. Furthermore, to detect
AIGT in the context of social media, we propose PsychoLinguistic AIGT Detection
Framework (PLAD), an interpretable approach that leverages psycholinguistic
features. Our experiments show that PLAD achieves superior detection
performance and provides insights into the signatures distinguishing human and
AI-generated content. More importantly, it reveals the complex relationship
between these linguistic features and social media engagement. The dataset is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了QCET质量评估分类法，旨在解决NLP评估中质量标准名称不一致导致评估结果不可比较的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NLP评估中存在数百个质量标准名称，即使名称相同也可能评估不同方面，导致独立评估结果无法可靠比较，阻碍了该领域的科学进展。

Method: 采用严格描述性方法，从三个NLP评估调查中推导出标准化的质量标准名称和定义，并将其组织成层次结构，其中父节点捕捉子节点的共同方面。

Result: 开发了QCET分类法及其相关资源，为现有评估的可比性建立、新评估设计指导和法规合规性评估提供了框架。

Conclusion: QCET分类法为解决NLP评估中的可比性问题提供了标准化解决方案，有助于推动该领域的科学进步。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that two NLP evaluation experiments that report results
for the same quality criterion name (e.g. Fluency) do not necessarily evaluate
the same aspect of quality, and the comparability implied by the name can be
misleading. Not knowing when two evaluations are comparable in this sense means
we currently lack the ability to draw reliable conclusions about system quality
on the basis of multiple, independently conducted evaluations. This in turn
hampers the ability of the field to progress scientifically as a whole, a
pervasive issue in NLP since its beginning (Sparck Jones, 1981). It is hard to
see how the issue of unclear comparability can be fully addressed other than by
the creation of a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions that
the several hundred quality criterion names actually in use in the field can be
mapped to, and grounded in. Taking a strictly descriptive approach, the QCET
Quality Criteria for Evaluation Taxonomy derives a standard set of quality
criterion names and definitions from three surveys of evaluations reported in
NLP, and structures them into a hierarchy where each parent node captures
common aspects of its child nodes. We present QCET and the resources it
consists of, and discuss its three main uses in (i) establishing comparability
of existing evaluations, (ii) guiding the design of new evaluations, and (iii)
assessing regulatory compliance.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了微调在模型编辑中无效的传统观点，提出通过恢复广度优先训练流程和局部化参数调整，微调可以成为有效的模型编辑方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为微调不适合模型编辑，但作者认为这种失败源于采用了不合适的深度优先训练流程，而非微调本身的问题。

Method: 恢复标准的广度优先（基于epoch）训练流程，使用小批量优化，并系统分析调优位置，开发了LocFT-BF局部化编辑方法。

Result: LocFT-BF在多种LLM和数据集上大幅超越现有最先进方法，首次实现10万次编辑和720亿参数模型的可持续编辑，且不损害通用能力。

Conclusion: 通过澄清误解和引入局部化调优策略，微调从被低估的基线方法发展为模型编辑的领先方法，为未来研究奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: Fine-tuning, a foundational method for adapting large language models, has
long been considered ineffective for model editing. Here, we challenge this
belief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent
limitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature
of the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each
sample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first
pipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces
interference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply
restoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based)
pipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness
for model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from
suboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through
systematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and
effective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework.
Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that
LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our
knowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x
beyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities. By clarifying
a long-standing misconception and introducing a principled localized tuning
strategy, we advance fine-tuning from an underestimated baseline to a leading
method for model editing, establishing a solid foundation for future research.

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了对话行为脚本（DAS）框架，通过结构化对话行为表示生成多语言对话，避免直接翻译带来的不自然和文化不恰当问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非英语对话数据集稀缺，现有方法通常基于英语对话翻译，这会引入人工痕迹，降低自然度和文化适宜性。

Method: 使用结构化对话行为表示来编码、本地化和生成多语言对话，从抽象意图表示生成目标语言的新对话。

Result: 在意大利语、德语和中文上的人类评估显示，DAS生成的对话在文化相关性、连贯性和情境适宜性方面优于机器和人工翻译。

Conclusion: DAS框架通过结构化对话行为表示有效缓解翻译腔问题，支持跨语言灵活本地化，生成更流畅自然的对话。

Abstract: Non-English dialogue datasets are scarce, and models are often trained or
evaluated on translations of English-language dialogues, an approach which can
introduce artifacts that reduce their naturalness and cultural appropriateness.
This work proposes Dialogue Act Script (DAS), a structured framework for
encoding, localizing, and generating multilingual dialogues from abstract
intent representations. Rather than translating dialogue utterances directly,
DAS enables the generation of new dialogues in the target language that are
culturally and contextually appropriate. By using structured dialogue act
representations, DAS supports flexible localization across languages,
mitigating translationese and enabling more fluent, naturalistic conversations.
Human evaluations across Italian, German, and Chinese show that DAS-generated
dialogues consistently outperform those produced by both machine and human
translators on measures of cultural relevance, coherence, and situational
appropriateness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Solve-to-Judge（S2J）方法来解决生成奖励模型（GRMs）中的解决-判断差距问题，通过同时利用模型的解决和判断能力进行监督，在减少训练数据量的情况下实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现GRMs存在显著的解决-判断差距：模型能够解决某些查询，但却无法做出正确判断。这种现象在14%-37%的查询中出现，限制了GRMs的判断能力。

Method: 提出S2J方法，在单个GRM的输出上同时利用其解决和判断能力进行监督，在模型优化过程中显式地链接问题解决和评估能力，从而缩小解决-判断差距。

Result: S2J有效减少了16.2%的解决-判断差距，将模型的判断性能提升了5.8%，在使用显著更小的训练数据集的情况下实现了最先进的性能，且不依赖更强大的外部模型进行蒸馏。

Conclusion: S2J方法通过自演化有效解决了GRMs中的解决-判断差距问题，在减少数据依赖的情况下提升了模型性能，为生成奖励模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), generative reward
models (GRMs) have been widely adopted for reward modeling and evaluation.
Previous studies have primarily focused on training specialized GRMs by
optimizing them on preference datasets with the judgment correctness as
supervision. While it's widely accepted that GRMs with stronger problem-solving
capabilities typically exhibit superior judgment abilities, we first identify a
significant solve-to-judge gap when examining individual queries. Specifically,
the solve-to-judge gap refers to the phenomenon where GRMs struggle to make
correct judgments on some queries (14%-37%), despite being fully capable of
solving them. In this paper, we propose the Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach to
address this problem. Specifically, S2J simultaneously leverages both the
solving and judging capabilities on a single GRM's output for supervision,
explicitly linking the GRM's problem-solving and evaluation abilities during
model optimization, thereby narrowing the gap. Our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that S2J effectively reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2%,
thereby enhancing the model's judgment performance by 5.8%. Notably, S2J
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among GRMs built on the same base
model while utilizing a significantly smaller training dataset. Moreover, S2J
accomplishes this through self-evolution without relying on more powerful
external models for distillation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于测试时计算扩展(TTS)的方法来验证复杂的数值声明，通过训练验证器模型从多个推理路径中选择正确路径，并引入自适应机制提高计算效率。


<details>

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在验证需要组合推理和数值推理的真实世界数值声明时存在不足，无法理解数值细微差别，且容易发生推理漂移问题。

Method: 采用测试时计算扩展(TTS)方法，从语言模型中引出多个推理路径，训练验证器模型(VERIFIERFC)从中选择正确路径，并引入自适应机制根据声明复杂度选择性应用TTS。

Result: TTS方法显著缓解了推理漂移问题，在数值声明验证任务上带来显著性能提升。自适应TTS方法比标准TTS效率提高1.8倍，比单次验证方法性能提升18.8%。

Conclusion: 测试时计算扩展结合验证器模型能有效提升复杂数值声明的验证性能，自适应机制在保持性能的同时显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Fact-checking real-world claims, particularly numerical claims, is inherently
complex that require multistep reasoning and numerical reasoning for verifying
diverse aspects of the claim. Although large language models (LLMs) including
reasoning models have made tremendous advances, they still fall short on
fact-checking real-world claims that require a combination of compositional and
numerical reasoning. They are unable to understand nuance of numerical aspects,
and are also susceptible to the reasoning drift issue, where the model is
unable to contextualize diverse information resulting in misinterpretation and
backtracking of reasoning process. In this work, we systematically explore
scaling test-time compute (TTS) for LLMs on the task of fact-checking complex
numerical claims, which entails eliciting multiple reasoning paths from an LLM.
We train a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to navigate this space of possible
reasoning paths and select one that could lead to the correct verdict. We
observe that TTS helps mitigate the reasoning drift issue, leading to
significant performance gains for fact-checking numerical claims. To improve
compute efficiency in TTS, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that performs TTS
selectively based on the perceived complexity of the claim. This approach
achieves 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS, while delivering a notable
18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods. Our

TL;DR: Uni-LAP是一个用于法律条文预测的通用框架，通过整合监督分类模型和大型语言模型的优势来解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律条文预测方法面临挑战：监督分类模型难以捕捉复杂事实模式，大型语言模型在预测场景中表现不佳，且不同司法管辖区的法律系统多样性导致方法缺乏普适性。

Method: 提出Uni-LAP框架，通过紧密协作整合SCM和LLM的优势：SCM使用新颖的Top-K损失函数生成候选条文，LLM采用三段论推理来优化最终预测。

Result: 在多个司法管辖区数据集上的评估表明，Uni-LAP始终优于现有基线方法，证明了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Uni-LAP通过整合SCM和LLM的优势，提供了一个有效的通用法律条文预测框架，在多个司法管辖区都表现出色。

Abstract: Legal Article Prediction (LAP) is a critical task in legal text
classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
automatically predict relevant legal articles based on the fact descriptions of
cases. As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal
role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties.
Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in
addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs),
such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to
their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while
excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due
to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the
diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most
approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability.
To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for
legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through
tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel
Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM
employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We
evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical
results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing
baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.

Method: 通过系统回顾31个模型和21个基准测试，分析编码器专用和生成式架构，考察训练方法和评估方法。

Result: 发现当前训练方法通过对比学习偏向语言中立性，而文化意识依赖于多样化数据；三分之二的评估基准使用基于翻译的方法，但近期工作开始纳入文化相关内容。

Conclusion: 存在跨语言能力的不一致，以及训练目标与评估目标之间的差距，需要在语言中立性和文化意识之间寻求更好的平衡。

Abstract: This survey examines multilingual vision-language models that process text

encoder-only and generative architectures, and identify a key tension between
language neutrality (consistent cross-lingual representations) and cultural
awareness (adaptation to cultural contexts). Current training methods favor
neutrality through contrastive learning, while cultural awareness depends on
diverse data. Two-thirds of evaluation benchmarks use translation-based
approaches prioritizing semantic consistency, though recent work incorporates
culturally grounded content. We find discrepancies in cross-lingual
capabilities and gaps between training objectives and evaluation goals.

Method: 通过指令-响应场景，将文本中提到的食品相关实体链接到FoodOn、SNOMED-CT和Hansard分类法等本体，并对模型进行微调。

Result: FoodSEM在相关模型/系统中实现了最先进的性能，与零样本、单样本和少样本LLM提示基准相比表现更优，某些本体和数据集的F1分数达到98%。

Conclusion: 本文的主要贡献包括发布适合LLM微调/评估的食品注释语料库、发布用于推进食品领域语义理解的鲁棒模型，以及为未来基准测试提供食品NEL的强基线。

Abstract: This paper introduces FoodSEM, a state-of-the-art fine-tuned open-source
large language model (LLM) for named-entity linking (NEL) to food-related
ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, food NEL is a task that cannot be
accurately solved by state-of-the-art general-purpose (large) language models
or custom domain-specific models/systems. Through an instruction-response (IR)
scenario, FoodSEM links food-related entities mentioned in a text to several
ontologies, including FoodOn, SNOMED-CT, and the Hansard taxonomy. The FoodSEM
model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to related models/systems,
with F1 scores even reaching 98% on some ontologies and datasets. The presented
comparative analyses against zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot LLM prompting
baselines further highlight FoodSEM's superior performance over its
non-fine-tuned version. By making FoodSEM and its related resources publicly
available, the main contributions of this article include (1) publishing a
food-annotated corpora into an IR format suitable for LLM
fine-tuning/evaluation, (2) publishing a robust model to advance the semantic
understanding of text in the food domain, and (3) providing a strong baseline
on food NEL for future benchmarking.

TL;DR: 提出Reasoning Capsule框架，通过将推理计划压缩为少量潜在标记来平衡推理效率和可解释性，基于信息瓶颈原则实现最小化但充分的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought提示在大型语言模型中导致的高延迟、高内存使用以及错误传播问题，寻求在潜在推理效率和显式推理透明度之间的平衡。

Method: 采用信息瓶颈原则，将高层推理计划压缩为少量学习的潜在标记（Reasoning Capsule），同时保持执行步骤轻量级或显式化，通过任务损失和计划重构损失的双重目标确保胶囊的充分性。

Result: 在保持或提高复杂基准测试准确性的同时，显著减少了推理过程中的可见标记数量，实现了效率、准确性和可解释性之间的平衡。

Conclusion: Reasoning Capsule框架成功地将潜在推理的效率与显式推理的透明度相结合，为复杂推理任务提供了一种更高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) tackle
complex reasoning by eliciting explicit step-by-step rationales. However, CoT's
verbosity increases latency and memory usage and may propagate early errors
across long chains. We propose the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule), a framework
that aims to combine the efficiency of latent reasoning with the transparency
of explicit CoT. The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small
set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution
steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be
approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via
a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is
encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an
auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully
represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground
the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of
uninformative shortcuts. Our framework strikes a balance between efficiency,
accuracy, and interpretability, thereby reducing the visible token footprint of
reasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks. Our
codes are available at:

TL;DR: GTO通过引入草稿树奖励和基于组的草稿策略训练，解决了推测解码中训练目标与解码策略不匹配的问题，显著提升了接受长度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法在训练时只优化单一路径，而解码时使用树策略验证多个分支，这种策略不匹配限制了速度提升潜力。

Method: 提出GTO方法，包含草稿树奖励（采样自由目标，衡量草稿树在目标模型下的期望接受长度）和基于组的草稿策略训练（通过对比当前和参考草稿模型的树，形成去偏的组标准化优势，应用PPO风格代理进行稳健更新）。

Result: 在对话、代码和数学任务上，GTO将接受长度提高7.4%，相比之前最先进的EAGLE-3额外带来7.7%的速度提升。

Conclusion: GTO通过弥合草稿策略不匹配，为高效LLM推理提供了实用且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by
letting a lightweight draft model propose multiple tokens that the target model
verifies in parallel. Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single
greedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and
verifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable
speedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training
with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree
Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of
the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance;
(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that
contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming
debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along
the longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that
increasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and
speedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and
multiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and
yields an additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3. By
bridging draft policy misalignment, GTO offers a practical, general solution
for efficient LLM inference.

Motivation: CoT推理虽然提升复杂任务性能，但因其冗长性导致推理延迟显著增加，需要一种既能保持性能又能减少延迟的压缩方法。

Method: 基于token弹性现象，采用多轮自适应压缩策略，逐步精炼CoT，为每个输入确定最优压缩深度。

Result: 相比最先进基线方法，平均准确率提升5.6%，CoT长度平均减少47个token，显著降低延迟；测试时性能可通过可解释特征可靠预测。

Conclusion: MACC证明CoT压缩既有效又可预测，支持高效模型选择和预测，无需重复微调。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves performance on complex tasks but
introduces significant inference latency due to verbosity. We propose
Multiround Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Compression (MACC), a framework that
leverages the token elasticity phenomenon--where overly small token budgets can
paradoxically increase output length--to progressively compress CoTs via
multiround refinement. This adaptive strategy allows MACC to determine the
optimal compression depth for each input. Our method achieves an average
accuracy improvement of 5.6 percent over state-of-the-art baselines, while also
reducing CoT length by an average of 47 tokens and significantly lowering
latency. Furthermore, we show that test-time performance--accuracy and token
length--can be reliably predicted using interpretable features like perplexity
and compression rate on the training set. Evaluated across different models,
our method enables efficient model selection and forecasting without repeated
fine-tuning, demonstrating that CoT compression is both effective and
predictable. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MACC.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gearing up to surpass human creativity. The
veracity of the statement needs careful consideration. In recent developments,
critical questions arise regarding the authenticity of human work and the
preservation of their creativity and innovative abilities. This paper
investigates such issues. This paper addresses machine-generated text detection
across several scenarios, including document-level binary and multiclass
classification or generator attribution, sentence-level segmentation to
differentiate between human-AI collaborative text, and adversarial attacks
aimed at reducing the detectability of machine-generated text. We introduce a
new work called BMAS English: an English language dataset for binary
classification of human and machine text, for multiclass classification, which
not only identifies machine-generated text but can also try to determine its
generator, and Adversarial attack addressing where it is a common act for the
mitigation of detection, and Sentence-level segmentation, for predicting the
boundaries between human and machine-generated text. We believe that this paper
will address previous work in Machine-Generated Text Detection (MGTD) in a more
meaningful way.

Motivation: 解决ICL处理多演示时效率低下和SFT训练开销大且缺乏灵活性的问题，探索将上下文直接映射到适配器参数的方法。

Method: 引入CompAs元学习框架，将上下文转换为组合结构的适配器参数，支持代数合并，并包含可逆编码机制。

Result: 在多项选择题和抽取式问答任务上，CompAs优于ICL和先前基于生成器的方法，尤其在扩展到更多输入时表现更佳。

Conclusion: 可组合的适配器生成为扩展LLM部署提供了实用且高效的替代方案，具有低推理成本、对长上下文不稳定的鲁棒性等优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often seamlessly adapt to new tasks through
in-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both of
these approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many
demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility.
Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter
parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored
generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need
to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce
CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter
parameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be
merged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved
passages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts.
Critically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost,
robustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution
when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes
information into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery
of input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical
results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show
that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when
scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a
practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment.

Conclusion: 指令微调在训练推理成本上保持帕累托最优，但推理模型在大规模时更具价值，特别是在需要深度推理的任务中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. Despite its empirical
success, the tasks and model scales at which reasoning becomes effective, as
well as its training and inference costs, remain underexplored. In this work,
we rely on a synthetic data distillation framework to conduct a large-scale
supervised study. We compare Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models
of varying sizes, on a wide range of math-centric and general-purpose tasks,
evaluating both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our analysis reveals
that reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or
surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Notably, while IFT remains
Pareto-optimal in training and inference costs, reasoning models become
increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits
on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks.

Conclusion: 虽然LLM输出在严格意义上无意义，但这不妨碍它们在认知实践中发挥积极作用，人们仍然可以从中获取有价值的信息。

Abstract: In this paper, we offer a simple argument for the conclusion that the outputs
of large language models (LLMs) are meaningless. Our argument is based on two
key premises: (a) that certain kinds of intentions are needed in order for
LLMs' outputs to have literal meanings, and (b) that LLMs cannot plausibly have
the right kinds of intentions. We defend this argument from various types of
responses, for example, the semantic externalist argument that deference can be
assumed to take the place of intentions and the semantic internalist argument
that meanings can be defined purely in terms of intrinsic relations between
concepts, such as conceptual roles. We conclude the paper by discussing why,
even if our argument is sound, the outputs of LLMs nevertheless seem meaningful
and can be used to acquire true beliefs and even knowledge.

*Tiago Fernandes Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了递归主题划分(RTP)框架，利用大语言模型构建二叉树，通过自然语言问题对数据进行语义划分，生成完全可解释的主题分类法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统主题模型在数据稀缺领域表现不佳的问题，以及关键词列表需要大量人工解释且缺乏语义连贯性的局限性。

Method: 使用大语言模型交互式构建二叉树，每个节点都是自然语言问题，语义上划分数据，形成可解释的分类法。

Result: RTP的问题驱动层次比BERTopic等基线方法的关键词主题更具可解释性，且在数据主题与任务标签相关时，这些聚类可作为下游分类任务的有力特征。

Conclusion: RTP引入了数据探索的新范式，从统计模式发现转向知识驱动的主题分析，其主题路径还可作为生成模型的结构化可控提示，实现源语料库中发现特征的持续模仿。

Abstract: Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in
data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models
offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that
require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic
coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce
Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the
tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data,
resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is
explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is
more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like
BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters
by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks,
particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels.
RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from
statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve
as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our
analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the
consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source
corpus.

*Yuhan Song,Linhao Zhang,Chuhan Wu,Aiwei Liu,Wei Jia,Houfeng Wang,Xiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了StableToken，一种通过多分支架构和位级投票机制实现稳定性的语义语音分词器，解决了现有分词器对无关声学扰动的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义语音分词器在捕获语言内容时对无关声学扰动异常脆弱，即使在高信噪比条件下，输出标记序列也会剧烈变化，增加了下游LLM的学习负担。

Method: 采用多分支并行处理音频，通过强大的位级投票机制合并表示，形成单一稳定的标记序列。

Result: StableToken在标记稳定性方面达到新SOTA，显著降低了各种噪声条件下的单元编辑距离，并直接转化为下游任务中SpeechLLM鲁棒性的显著提升。

Conclusion: 共识驱动机制能有效解决语音分词器的稳定性问题，为下游语音语言模型提供更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic speech tokenizers, designed to capture linguistic content,
are surprisingly fragile. We find they are not robust to meaning-irrelevant
acoustic perturbations; even at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) where speech
is perfectly intelligible, their output token sequences can change drastically,
increasing the learning burden for downstream LLMs. This instability stems from
two flaws: a brittle single-path quantization architecture and a distant
training signal indifferent to intermediate token stability. To address this,
we introduce StableToken, a tokenizer that achieves stability through a
consensus-driven mechanism. Its multi-branch architecture processes audio in
parallel, and these representations are merged via a powerful bit-wise voting
mechanism to form a single, stable token sequence. StableToken sets a new
state-of-the-art in token stability, drastically reducing Unit Edit Distance
(UED) under diverse noise conditions. This foundational stability translates
directly to downstream benefits, significantly improving the robustness of
SpeechLLMs on a variety of tasks.

TL;DR: 提出复合推理(CR)方法，让大语言模型能够动态组合多种推理风格（演绎、归纳、溯因等），在科学和医学问答任务中优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型依赖单一推理范式，难以处理需要多种认知策略的复杂问题，需要更灵活多样的推理能力。

Method: 开发复合推理方法，使模型能够动态探索和组合多种推理风格，根据问题领域自适应地强调不同的推理方式。

Result: 在科学和医学问答基准测试中，CR方法超越了Chain-of-Thought和DeepSeek-R1等基线方法，展现出更好的样本效率和适当的token使用。

Conclusion: 通过培养内部推理风格的多样性，大语言模型获得了更强大、自适应和高效的问题解决能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, rely on
singular, pre-dominant reasoning paradigms, hindering their performance on
intricate problems that demand diverse cognitive strategies. To address this,
we introduce Composite Reasoning (CR), a novel reasoning approach empowering
LLMs to dynamically explore and combine multiple reasoning styles like
deductive, inductive, and abductive for more nuanced problem-solving. Evaluated
on scientific and medical question-answering benchmarks, our approach
outperforms existing baselines like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and also surpasses
the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 style reasoning (SR) capabilities, while
demonstrating superior sample efficiency and adequate token usage. Notably, CR
adaptively emphasizes domain-appropriate reasoning styles. It prioritizes
abductive and deductive reasoning for medical question answering, but shifts to
causal, deductive, and inductive methods for scientific reasoning. Our findings
highlight that by cultivating internal reasoning style diversity, LLMs acquire
more robust, adaptive, and efficient problem-solving abilities.

*Jaehoon Kim,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出反向推测解码(RSD)方法，通过让学生模型基于自身概率分布筛选教师模型生成的推理轨迹，解决大模型向小模型知识迁移时因分布不匹配导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大模型向小模型监督微调方法会因分布不匹配而失败，教师模型的推理轨迹包含学生模型低概率的token，超出小模型的表示能力，反而成为学习障碍。

Method: RSD方法让教师模型生成候选token，但由学生模型基于自身概率分布决定是否接受，过滤掉低概率token，生成学生友好的推理轨迹。

Result: 在Qwen3-0.6B上的实验显示，直接蒸馏s1K-1.1推理轨迹数据使性能下降20.5%，而使用RSD生成的推理轨迹训练则提升4.9%。

Conclusion: 低概率token是推理能力迁移的关键瓶颈，RSD方法有效但需要针对每个学生架构的独特内部表示进行定制化分布对齐。

Abstract: Transferring reasoning capabilities from larger language models to smaller
ones through supervised fine-tuning often fails counterintuitively, with
performance degrading despite access to high-quality teacher demonstrations. We
identify that this failure stems from distributional misalignment: reasoning
traces from larger models contain tokens that are low probability under the
student's distribution, exceeding the internal representation capacity of
smaller architectures and creating learning barriers rather than helpful
guidance. We propose Reverse Speculative Decoding (RSD), a mechanism for
generating student-friendly reasoning traces in which the teacher model
proposes candidate tokens but the student model determines acceptance based on
its own probability distributions, filtering low probability tokens. When
applied to Qwen3-0.6B, direct distillation of s1K-1.1 reasoning trace data
degrades average performance across major reasoning benchmarks by 20.5\%, while
the same model trained on RSD-generated reasoning traces achieves meaningful
improvements of 4.9\%. Our analysis reveals that low probability tokens
constitute the critical bottleneck in reasoning ability transfer. However,
cross-model experiments demonstrate that RSD traces are model-specific rather
than universally applicable, indicating that distributional alignment must be
tailored for each student architecture's unique internal representation.

TL;DR: 提出了FeatBench基准测试，专门评估LLM在"氛围编程"范式下的功能实现能力，填补现有代码生成基准测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试与"氛围编程"范式不匹配，要么需要代码级规范，要么只关注问题解决，忽略了功能实现这一关键场景。

Method: 构建FeatBench基准测试，具有纯自然语言提示、严格的数据收集流程、全面的测试用例和多样化的应用领域等特点。

Result: 评估结果显示，在氛围编程范式下实现功能具有显著挑战性，最高成功率仅为29.94%，并发现了"激进实现"策略的矛盾现象。

Conclusion: FeatBench为社区研究提供了有效的评估工具，揭示了氛围编程中功能实现的挑战性和独特特征。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a
novel software development paradigm known as "vibe coding," where users
interact with coding agents through high-level natural language. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks for code generation inadequately assess an
agent's vibe coding capabilities. Existing benchmarks are misaligned, as they
either require code-level specifications or focus narrowly on issue-solving,
neglecting the critical scenario of feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradiam. To address this gap, we propose FeatBench, a novel benchmark
for vibe coding that focuses on feature implementation. Our benchmark is
distinguished by several key features: 1. Pure Natural Language Prompts. Task
inputs consist solely of abstract natural language descriptions, devoid of any
code or structural hints. 2. A Rigorous & Evolving Data Collection Process.
FeatBench is built on a multi-level filtering pipeline to ensure quality and a
fully automated pipeline to evolve the benchmark, mitigating data
contamination. 3. Comprehensive Test Cases. Each task includes Fail-to-Pass
(F2P) and Pass-to-Pass (P2P) tests to verify correctness and prevent
regressions. 4. Diverse Application Domains. The benchmark includes
repositories from diverse domains to ensure it reflects real-world scenarios.
We evaluate two state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs on
FeatBench. Our evaluation reveals that feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradigm is a significant challenge, with the highest success rate of
only 29.94%. Our analysis also reveals a tendency for "aggressive
implementation," a strategy that paradoxically leads to both critical failures
and superior software design. We release FeatBench, our automated collection
pipeline, and all experimental results to facilitate further community
research.

Motivation: 全双工语音到语音LLM是实现自然人机交互的基础，但目前缺乏专门的基准测试来评估这些模型，特别是在紧急场景下的中断能力。

Method: 开发了FLEXI基准测试，包含6个多样化的人机交互场景，系统评估实时对话的延迟、质量和对话效果，特别关注模型在紧急情况下的中断能力。

Result: 评估显示开源模型与商业模型在紧急意识、轮次终止和交互延迟方面存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 下一对令牌预测是实现真正无缝和类人全双工交互的有前景方向。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling real-time spoken dialogue systems.
However, benchmarking and modeling these models remains a fundamental
challenge. We introduce FLEXI, the first benchmark for full-duplex LLM-human
spoken interaction that explicitly incorporates model interruption in emergency
scenarios. FLEXI systematically evaluates the latency, quality, and
conversational effectiveness of real-time dialogue through six diverse
human-LLM interaction scenarios, revealing significant gaps between open source
and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction
latency. Finally, we suggest that next token-pair prediction offers a promising
path toward achieving truly seamless and human-like full-duplex interaction.

TL;DR: 该论文从法律合规角度解决LLM安全问题，提出安全合规概念，基于欧盟AI法案和GDPR构建安全合规基准，并通过GRPO方法训练Compliance Reasoner来提升LLM的安全合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全方法缺乏系统性保护，无法应对现代LLM系统的复杂行为。作者认为法律框架可以作为定义和衡量安全合规的标准。

Method: 1) 基于法律条文生成真实LLM安全场景，构建安全合规基准；2) 使用GRPO方法对齐Qwen3-8B模型，构建Compliance Reasoner安全推理器。

Result: Compliance Reasoner在新基准上表现优异，欧盟AI法案平均提升10.45%，GDPR平均提升11.85%。

Conclusion: 从法律合规角度解决LLM安全问题是有效的，Compliance Reasoner能够显著提升LLM的安全合规性。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities, elevating the critical importance of LLM safety. However,
existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic
protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of
modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal
compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit
relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and
measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as
core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the
gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark
for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with
legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively
aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior
performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the
EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.

TL;DR: SSKG-LLM是一个创新的模型架构，旨在将知识图谱的结构和语义信息有效整合到大型语言模型的推理过程中，解决幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs处理知识图谱时主要将其视为纯文本，仅提取语义信息而忽略了关键的结构方面。此外，知识图谱编码器和LLMs文本嵌入空间之间的差距阻碍了结构化知识的有效整合。

Method: SSKG-LLM包含知识图谱检索(KGR)模块和知识图谱编码(KGE)模块来保持语义的同时利用结构。然后加入知识图谱适应(KGA)模块使LLMs能够理解知识图谱嵌入。

Result: 通过广泛实验和详细分析，探索了整合知识图谱结构信息如何增强LLMs的事实推理能力。

Conclusion: SSKG-LLM成功解决了LLMs整合知识图谱时的结构信息利用不足和嵌入空间不匹配问题，显著提升了事实推理能力。

Abstract: Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the
hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs
typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and
limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge
is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text
embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To
overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model
architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and
Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM
incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph
Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then,
the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to
understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a
detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of
KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型经常从训练数据中复制或放大社会偏见，而其黑盒特性使得用户难以识别偏见预测，开发者难以有效缓解偏见。现有关于公平NLP中可解释性的研究主要是定性的，缺乏大规模定量分析。

Method: 在仇恨言论检测中，对编码器和仅解码器模型进行了系统研究，考察了三个关键维度：(1)识别偏见预测，(2)选择公平模型，(3)在模型训练中缓解偏见。

Result: 研究发现基于输入的解释能有效检测偏见预测，并可作为减少训练中偏见的有用监督信号，但在选择候选模型中的公平模型方面不可靠。

Conclusion: 基于输入的解释在检测偏见和缓解训练偏见方面有效，但在模型选择方面存在局限性，需要谨慎使用。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) models often replicate or amplify social
bias from training data, raising concerns about fairness. At the same time,
their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to recognize biased
predictions and for developers to effectively mitigate them. While some studies
suggest that input-based explanations can help detect and mitigate bias, others
question their reliability in ensuring fairness. Existing research on
explainability in fair NLP has been predominantly qualitative, with limited
large-scale quantitative analysis. In this work, we conduct the first
systematic study of the relationship between explainability and fairness in
hate speech detection, focusing on both encoder- and decoder-only models. We
examine three key dimensions: (1) identifying biased predictions, (2) selecting
fair models, and (3) mitigating bias during model training. Our findings show
that input-based explanations can effectively detect biased predictions and
serve as useful supervision for reducing bias during training, but they are
unreliable for selecting fair models among candidates.

Method: 使用MALLS和Willow数据集，比较编码器-解码器与仅解码器架构，探索词汇扩展、谓词条件化和多语言训练等技术，引入精确匹配、逻辑等价和谓词对齐等指标。

Result: 微调Flan-T5-XXL在提供谓词列表时达到70%准确率，优于GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1-0528模型以及ccg2lambda等符号系统。谓词可用性提升性能15-20%，T5模型超越更大的仅解码器LLMs，模型能泛化到未见过的逻辑论证。

Conclusion: 结构逻辑翻译被证明是鲁棒的，但谓词提取成为主要瓶颈。

Abstract: Automating the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) is
crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods, yet remains
challenging. We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this
task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training
strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like
vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training,
introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate
alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate
lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT
reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings
show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models
surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical
arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic
translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.

Method: 生成有向图来训练不同规模的Transformer模型，评估它们在不同图大小下推断传递关系的能力，重点关注网格状图的连通性学习。

Result: Transformer能够学习低维子空间中可嵌入的网格状有向图的连通性，图维度是预测模型能力的重要指标。模型规模扩大能提升泛化能力，但非网格图和多分量图对模型构成挑战。

Conclusion: Transformer模型能够学习传递关系推理，但能力受图结构和维度影响。模型规模扩大有助于性能提升，但在复杂图结构下仍存在学习困难。

Abstract: Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the
responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust
reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as
causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of
transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A
causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive
relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,
knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then
there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can
learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input
prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from
training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this
study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train
transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer
transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that
transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed
graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and
connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that
the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of
transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional
grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In
addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly
better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the
graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components,
transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the
number of components is large.

invective language throughout 16th-century England. Subsequently, we assess and
compare the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and zero-shot prompted

Abstract: Recent advances in Bayesian probability theory and its application to
cognitive science in combination with the development of a new generation of
computational tools and methods for probabilistic computation have led to a
'probabilistic turn' in pragmatics and semantics. In particular, the framework
of Rational Speech Act theory has been developed to model broadly Gricean
accounts of pragmatic phenomena in Bayesian terms, starting with fairly simple
reference games and covering ever more complex communicative exchanges such as
verbal syllogistic reasoning. This paper explores in which way a similar
Bayesian approach might be applied to relevance-theoretic pragmatics (Sperber &
Wilson, 1995) by study a paradigmatic pragmatic phenomenon: the communication
of implicit meaning by ways of (conversational) implicatures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语料库缺乏长期时间结构，限制了LLM理解语言语义和规范演变的能力，需要支持历时语言变化分析的时间结构化语料。

Method: 从古腾堡计划整理英语书籍文本，添加时间注释，通过时敏VAD分析量化词汇语义变化，构建历史校准的情感词典。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at operating at scale by leveraging social
media and various data crawled from the web. Whereas existing corpora are
diverse, their frequent lack of long-term temporal structure may however limit
an LLM's ability to contextualize semantic and normative evolution of language
and to capture diachronic variation. To support analysis and training for the
latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book
texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a
variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us
to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive
Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically
calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation.
With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to
better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization
of sentiment across various time-periods. In fact, we show how language models
trained sequentially on CHRONOBERG struggle to encode diachronic shifts in
meaning, emphasizing the need for temporally aware training and evaluation
pipelines, and positioning CHRONOBERG as a scalable resource for the study of
linguistic change and temporal generalization. Disclaimer: This paper includes

### [86] [Exploratory Semantic Reliability Analysis of Wind Turbine Maintenance Logs using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22366)
*Max Malyi,Jonathan Shek,Andre Biscaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个使用大型语言模型（LLMs）对风力涡轮机维护日志进行深度语义分析的框架，超越了传统的文本分类方法，实现了故障模式识别、因果链推断等复杂推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风力涡轮机维护日志中包含大量非结构化文本信息，传统定量可靠性分析难以利用这些数据。现有机器学习方法通常只停留在文本分类层面，无法进行更复杂的推理分析。

Method: 引入探索性框架，利用LLMs执行四个分析工作流：故障模式识别、因果链推断、比较站点分析和数据质量审计，将LLMs作为可靠性协作者进行深度语义分析。

Result: LLMs能够作为强大的"可靠性协作者"，超越简单标签分类，综合文本信息并生成可操作的专家级假设，有效挖掘非结构化数据中的洞察。

Conclusion: 这项工作为使用LLMs作为推理工具提供了新颖且可复现的方法论，为风能行业增强运营智能开辟了新途径，解锁了先前隐藏在非结构化数据中的洞察。

Abstract: A wealth of operational intelligence is locked within the unstructured
free-text of wind turbine maintenance logs, a resource largely inaccessible to
traditional quantitative reliability analysis. While machine learning has been
applied to this data, existing approaches typically stop at classification,
categorising text into predefined labels. This paper addresses the gap in
leveraging modern large language models (LLMs) for more complex reasoning
tasks. We introduce an exploratory framework that uses LLMs to move beyond
classification and perform deep semantic analysis. We apply this framework to a
large industrial dataset to execute four analytical workflows: failure mode
identification, causal chain inference, comparative site analysis, and data
quality auditing. The results demonstrate that LLMs can function as powerful
"reliability co-pilots," moving beyond labelling to synthesise textual
information and generate actionable, expert-level hypotheses. This work
contributes a novel and reproducible methodology for using LLMs as a reasoning
tool, offering a new pathway to enhance operational intelligence in the wind
energy sector by unlocking insights previously obscured in unstructured data.

*Tanise Ceron,Dmitry Nikolaev,Dominik Stammbach,Debora Nozza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文分析了OLMO2开源模型训练数据中的政治偏见，发现左倾文档在数据集中占主导地位，且训练数据中的主要政治立场与模型在政策问题上的偏见密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型会产生政治偏见文本，但偏见如何产生尚不清楚。当前LLM研究中对训练数据的政治内容分析不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 从OLMO2的预训练和后训练语料库中抽取大样本，自动标注文档的政治倾向，分析其来源领域和内容，评估训练数据中政治内容与模型政策立场的关系。

Result: 左倾文档在数据集中占主导地位；预训练语料比后训练数据包含更多政治参与内容；左右倾向文档通过不同价值观和合法性来源框架相似话题；训练数据中的主要立场与模型政治偏见强相关。

Conclusion: 需要在未来数据整理流程中整合政治内容分析，并详细记录过滤策略以提高透明度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to generate politically biased text,
yet how such biases arise remains unclear. A crucial step toward answering this
question is the analysis of training data, whose political content remains
largely underexplored in current LLM research. To address this gap, we present
in this paper an analysis of the pre- and post-training corpora of OLMO2, the
largest fully open-source model released together with its complete dataset.
From these corpora, we draw large random samples, automatically annotate
documents for political orientation, and analyze their source domains and
content. We then assess how political content in the training data correlates
with models' stance on specific policy issues. Our analysis shows that
left-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora
containing significantly more politically engaged content than post-training
data. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics
through distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant
stance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases
when evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to
integrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as
well as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chimera是一个包含7,500个高质量维基百科图表的测试套件，用于评估视觉语言模型对图表的真实理解能力，发现当前模型主要依赖捷径行为而非真正理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图表相关基准上表现良好，但可能依赖知识、推理或模态捷径，而非真正理解和推理图表内容，需要更严格的评估方法。

Method: 构建Chimera测试套件，包含7,500个维基百科图表，每个图表用语义三元组标注符号内容，并设计多级问题评估四个基本理解方面：实体识别、关系理解、知识基础和视觉推理。

Result: 评估15个开源视觉语言模型发现，其看似强大的性能主要来自捷径行为：视觉记忆捷径影响轻微，知识回忆捷径作用中等，Clever-Hans捷径贡献显著。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在图表理解方面存在严重局限，需要更稳健的评估协议来基准化复杂视觉输入的真实理解能力，而非问题回答捷径。

Abstract: Diagrams convey symbolic information in a visual format rather than a linear
stream of words, making them especially challenging for AI models to process.
While recent evaluations suggest that vision-language models (VLMs) perform
well on diagram-related benchmarks, their reliance on knowledge, reasoning, or
modality shortcuts raises concerns about whether they genuinely understand and
reason over diagrams. To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a
comprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from
Wikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by
semantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four
fundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation
understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to
measure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering:
(1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual
patterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized
factual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans
shortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without
true comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on
Chimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from
shortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact,
knowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts
contribute significantly. These findings expose critical limitations in current
VLMs and underscore the need for more robust evaluation protocols that
benchmark genuine comprehension of complex visual inputs (e.g., diagrams)
rather than question-answering shortcuts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过激活空间方向检测LLM不可回答性的方法，在抽取式问答任务中有效识别无答案问题，且能泛化到其他不可回答场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在面对缺乏足够信息的问题时仍会自信回答，导致幻觉答案。需要解决不可回答性检测问题，特别是在抽取式问答中判断文本是否包含足够信息来回答问题。

Method: 通过在模型激活空间中识别捕获不可回答性的方向，在推理时应用激活加法并测量其对模型弃权行为的影响，将隐藏激活投影到该方向获得可靠的不可回答性分类分数。

Result: 在两个开源LLM和四个抽取式QA基准测试中，该方法能有效检测不可回答问题，在跨数据集泛化方面优于现有的基于提示和分类器的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能处理抽取式QA中的不可回答性，还能扩展到因缺乏科学共识和主观性等因素导致的不可回答情况，因果干预显示该方向能有效控制模型的弃权行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often respond confidently to questions even when
they lack the necessary information, leading to hallucinated answers. In this
work, we study the problem of (un)answerability detection, focusing on
extractive question answering (QA) where the model should determine if a
passage contains sufficient information to answer a given question. We propose
a simple approach for identifying a direction in the model's activation space
that captures unanswerability and uses it for classification. This direction is
selected by applying activation additions during inference and measuring their
impact on the model's abstention behavior. We show that projecting hidden
activations onto this direction yields a reliable score for (un)answerability
classification. Experiments on two open-weight LLMs and four extractive QA
benchmarks show that our method effectively detects unanswerable questions and
generalizes better across datasets than existing prompt-based and
classifier-based approaches. Moreover, the obtained directions extend beyond
extractive QA to unanswerability that stems from factors, such as lack of
scientific consensus and subjectivity. Last, causal interventions show that
adding or ablating the directions effectively controls the abstention behavior
of the model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估LLaMA和Gemini在多语言法律任务中的表现，发现法律任务对LLM具有显著挑战，准确率通常低于50%，且存在提示敏感性和对抗性脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM主导的时代，了解其在法律等高风险领域的性能和局限性至关重要，特别是在多语言、跨司法管辖区和对抗性环境下的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用LLM-as-a-Judge方法进行人类对齐评估，在多语言法律和非法律基准上测试LLaMA和Gemini，并通过字符和词级扰动评估其对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 法律推理基准LEXam上的准确率通常低于50%，而通用任务XNLI上超过70%；Gemini平均比LLaMA高约24个百分点；性能与语言和英语的句法相似性相关。

Conclusion: 尽管新LLM有所改进，但在关键的多语言法律应用中可靠部署仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究提升其法律推理能力和对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their
capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is
crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini,
DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal
workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and
adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA
and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their
adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level
perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation.
We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to
support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and
datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification,
summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that
legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below
50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on
general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields
more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt
sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across
languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a
language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is
weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24
percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs,
challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Lexical semantic change has primarily been investigated with observational
and experimental methods; however, observational methods (corpus analysis,
distributional semantic modeling) cannot get at causal mechanisms, and
experimental paradigms with humans are hard to apply to semantic change due to
the extended diachronic processes involved. This work introduces NeLLCom-Lex, a
neural-agent framework designed to simulate semantic change by first grounding
agents in a real lexical system (e.g. English) and then systematically
manipulating their communicative needs. Using a well-established color naming
task, we simulate the evolution of a lexical system within a single generation,
and study which factors lead agents to: (i) develop human-like naming behavior
and lexicons, and (ii) change their behavior and lexicons according to their
communicative needs. Our experiments with different supervised and
reinforcement learning pipelines show that neural agents trained to 'speak' an
existing language can reproduce human-like patterns in color naming to a
remarkable extent, supporting the further use of NeLLCom-Lex to elucidate the
mechanisms of semantic change.

Motivation: 现有方法主要通过监督微调或强化学习来提升LLM的问题解决能力，本文从新的视角研究单个问题生成的解决方案之间的分歧，探索解决方案分歧与问题解决能力的关系。

Method: 提出解决方案分歧作为新指标，在三个代表性问题领域进行测试，将该指标应用于监督微调和强化学习策略中。

Result: 研究发现解决方案分歧与问题解决能力呈正相关，使用该指标能持续提高成功率。

Conclusion: 解决方案分歧是一个简单但有效的工具，可用于推进LLM的训练和评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for problem-solving tasks.
Most recent work improves their performance through supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with labeled data or reinforcement learning (RL) from task feedback. In
this paper, we study a new perspective: the divergence in solutions generated
by LLMs for a single problem. We show that higher solution divergence is
positively related to better problem-solving abilities across various models.
Based on this finding, we propose solution divergence as a novel metric that
can support both SFT and RL strategies. We test this idea on three
representative problem domains and find that using solution divergence
consistently improves success rates. These results suggest that solution
divergence is a simple but effective tool for advancing LLM training and
evaluation.

Result: 在成功预测和模型选择任务上达到竞争性或最先进的结果，在样本外场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、可扩展且可解释的LLM表示方式，能够实时适应动态扩展的模型库。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks,
and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained
models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a
significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM
representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited
scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and
datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that
cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free
approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic
task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models'
application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical
properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to
dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success
prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art
results with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法在优化单个对齐目标时会覆盖其他目标的表示，导致灾难性遗忘；而简单的多分支设计会导致不同目标间的输出不一致

Method: 两阶段1-to-N框架：阶段I计算共享表示，阶段II通过策略参考机制在并行分支中进行目标特定控制

Result: 在多个7B LLM上验证，AMBS显著提升HHH对齐分数（DeepSeek-7B提升32.4%），减少11.0%的不安全输出

Conclusion: AMBS能够有效实现统一高效的多目标对齐，在保持跨目标一致性的同时提升整体性能

Abstract: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple
objectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe
and reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control
signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via
one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single
alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for
other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches
extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While
this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize
each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs
across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch
Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient
multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the
Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage
II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a
policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while
maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca,
BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment
across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves
average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared
to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端的FP8训练配方，通过细粒度混合粒度量化策略，在保持数值精度的同时显著提升大语言模型训练效率，相比BF16基线可减少22%训练时间、14%内存使用，并提升19%吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练的巨大计算成本是创新的主要障碍，虽然FP8训练提供了显著的理论效率增益，但由于缺乏全面开源训练配方而未能广泛应用。

Method: 采用端到端FP8训练配方，整合持续预训练和监督微调，使用细粒度混合粒度量化策略来平衡数值保真度和计算效率。

Result: 在160B token语料上的持续预训练实验表明，该配方不仅非常稳定且基本无损，在推理基准测试中性能与BF16基线相当，同时显著提升效率。

Conclusion: FP8是BF16的实用且鲁棒的替代方案，将发布配套代码以进一步民主化大规模模型训练。

Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising
solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption
has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe.
To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that
seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our
methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to
maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through
extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a
160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable
but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16
baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved
with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in
training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in
throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to
BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize
large-scale model training.

Result: CogFlow有效提升了LLMs和人类的社会认知能力，带来更有效的社交决策

Conclusion: 认知推理范式成功弥补了逻辑推理在社交情境中的不足，为AI系统处理复杂社交互动提供了新方法

Abstract: LLMs trained for logical reasoning excel at step-by-step deduction to reach
verifiable answers. However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social
situations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues
that rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Cognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It
formulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of
interconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which
combine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then
propose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs.
CogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the
associative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured
planning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via
supervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the
model to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward
that optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality. Extensive experiments
show that CogFlow effectively enhances the social cognitive capabilities of
LLMs, and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR门户中的异步患者-临床医生消息增加了临床医生的工作量，促使使用LLM辅助起草回复。但LLM输出可能存在临床不准确、遗漏或语气不匹配等问题，因此需要稳健的评估方法。

Method: 提出了三方面贡献：1) 开发包含5个领域59个细粒度错误代码的临床错误本体；2) 构建检索增强评估管道(RAEC)，利用语义相似的历史消息-响应对提高判断质量；3) 使用DSPy的两阶段提示架构实现可扩展、可解释的分层错误检测。

Conclusion: RAEC管道可作为患者消息的AI护栏，显著提高LLM生成回复的质量评估效果。

Abstract: Asynchronous patient-clinician messaging via EHR portals is a growing source
of clinician workload, prompting interest in large language models (LLMs) to
assist with draft responses. However, LLM outputs may contain clinical
inaccuracies, omissions, or tone mismatches, making robust evaluation
essential. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a clinically
grounded error ontology comprising 5 domains and 59 granular error codes,
developed through inductive coding and expert adjudication; (2) we develop a
retrieval-augmented evaluation pipeline (RAEC) that leverages semantically
similar historical message-response pairs to improve judgment quality; and (3)
we provide a two-stage prompting architecture using DSPy to enable scalable,
interpretable, and hierarchical error detection. Our approach assesses the
quality of drafts both in isolation and with reference to similar past
message-response pairs retrieved from institutional archives. Using a two-stage
DSPy pipeline, we compared baseline and reference-enhanced evaluations on over
1,500 patient messages. Retrieval context improved error identification in
domains such as clinical completeness and workflow appropriateness. Human
validation on 100 messages demonstrated superior agreement (concordance = 50%
vs. 33%) and performance (F1 = 0.500 vs. 0.256) of context-enhanced labels vs.
baseline, supporting the use of our RAEC pipeline as AI guardrails for patient
messaging.

Motivation: 现有评估幻觉定位的流程复杂且缺乏专门的基准测试，作者希望探索LLM在此任务上的适用性，作为更实用的替代方案。

Method: 构建了一个包含1000多个示例的人类标注基准测试，提出了基于自由文本描述的幻觉表示方法，评估了四种大规模LLM，并分析了最佳提示策略。

of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to
existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks
for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored
to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We
complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its
quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations
limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new
representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full
range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four
large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best
model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer
insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main
factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag
missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts
in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct
information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment
with the model's parametric knowledge.

TL;DR: 该论文证明所有标准次正则语言类在由其判定谓词表示时都是线性可分的，这确立了有限可观测性并保证了简单线性模型的可学习性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究次正则语言类的线性可分性，为自然语言结构建模提供严格且可解释的理论基础。

Method: 通过理论证明和实验验证：理论证明标准次正则语言类的线性可分性，合成实验验证无噪声条件下的完美可分性，真实数据实验在英语形态学上验证学习特征与已知语言约束的一致性。

Result: 理论证明所有标准次正则语言类都是线性可分的，合成实验显示无噪声条件下完美可分，真实实验显示学习特征与语言约束对齐。

Conclusion: 次正则层次结构为自然语言结构建模提供了严格且可解释的基础，代码已开源。

Abstract: We prove that all standard subregular language classes are linearly separable
when represented by their deciding predicates. This establishes finite
observability and guarantees learnability with simple linear models. Synthetic
experiments confirm perfect separability under noise-free conditions, while
real-data experiments on English morphology show that learned features align
with well-known linguistic constraints. These results demonstrate that the
subregular hierarchy provides a rigorous and interpretable foundation for
modeling natural language structure. Our code used in real-data experiments is

Motivation: 随着NLP技术的发展，计算建模审议过程成为可能，通过分析意见转变和预测不同场景下的结果，为决策提供支持。

Method: 收集不同背景个体的意见构建数据集，使用富含冲击性事实的产品演示模拟审议过程，比较频率基话语调制和量子审议框架两种模型。

Result: 提出的两种模型在解释审议性话语和产生有意义的见解方面优于现有最先进模型，能够有效捕捉受众意见的可测量转变。

Conclusion: 该研究在公共政策制定、辩论评估、决策支持框架和大规模社交媒体意见挖掘方面具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Deliberation plays a crucial role in shaping outcomes by weighing diverse
perspectives before reaching decisions. With recent advancements in Natural
Language Processing, it has become possible to computationally model
deliberation by analyzing opinion shifts and predicting potential outcomes
under varying scenarios. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of
multiple NLP techniques to evaluate how effectively models interpret
deliberative discourse and produce meaningful insights. Opinions from
individuals of varied backgrounds were collected to construct a self-sourced
dataset that reflects diverse viewpoints. Deliberation was simulated using
product presentations enriched with striking facts, which often prompted
measurable shifts in audience opinions. We have given comparative analysis
between two models namely Frequency-Based Discourse Modulation and
Quantum-Deliberation Framework which outperform the existing state of art
models. The findings highlight practical applications in public policy-making,
debate evaluation, decision-support frameworks, and large-scale social media

*Jonne Sälevä,Duygu Ataman,Constantine Lignos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一套基于重采样的方法，用于量化多语言和/或多任务NLP基准测试中评估指标的不确定性和统计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验性能分数的变化既来自模型相关因素也来自数据相关因素，需要同时考虑这两者以避免显著低估假设重复实验的总体变异性。

Method: 使用重采样方法来量化评估指标的不确定性，考虑了模型和数据两个来源的变异性。

Result: 通过多语言问答、机器翻译和命名实体识别等示例任务，证明重采样方法可用于计算排行榜中各种统计量的抽样分布。

Conclusion: 重采样方法是量化NLP基准测试中评估指标不确定性的有效工具，能够更准确地反映性能测量的统计精度。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set of resampling-based methods for quantifying
uncertainty and statistical precision of evaluation metrics in multilingual
and/or multitask NLP benchmarks. We show how experimental variation in
performance scores arises from both model- and data-related sources, and that
accounting for both of them is necessary to avoid substantially underestimating
the overall variability over hypothetical replications. Using multilingual
question answering, machine translation, and named entity recognition as
example tasks, we also demonstrate how resampling methods are useful for
computing sampling distributions for various quantities used in leaderboards
such as the average/median, pairwise differences between models, and rankings.

### [104] [StateX: Enhancing RNN Recall via Post-training State Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22630)
*Xingyu Shen,Yingfa Chen,Zhen Leng Thai,Xu Han,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StateX是一种通过后训练高效扩展预训练RNN状态大小的训练流程，能够提升循环神经网络的长上下文回忆和上下文学习能力，而不显著增加模型参数或训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在处理长上下文时成本高昂，而RNN虽然具有恒定复杂度，但受限于固定大小的循环状态，难以准确回忆长上下文信息。直接训练更大状态的RNN会导致高训练成本。

Method: 为线性注意力和状态空间模型这两类流行RNN设计了后训练架构修改，通过StateX训练流程扩展状态大小，几乎不增加模型参数。

Result: 在1.3B参数的模型上实验表明，StateX能高效提升RNN的回忆和上下文学习能力，且不产生高后训练成本或损害其他能力。

Conclusion: StateX提供了一种高效扩展预训练RNN状态大小的方法，解决了RNN在长上下文回忆方面的局限性，同时保持了训练效率。

Abstract: While Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable language modeling
performance, their high complexities result in high costs when processing long
contexts. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear
attention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant
per-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks
that require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts,
because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent
state. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated
with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent
states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a
training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs
through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and
state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to
scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.
Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently
enhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring
high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将思维轨迹作为潜变量的变分推理框架，通过变分推理优化语言模型的推理能力，统一了变分推理与强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为语言模型提供原则性的概率视角，通过变分推理框架改进推理能力，并统一变分推理与强化学习方法。

Method: 从证据下界(ELBO)出发，扩展到多轨迹目标以获得更紧的边界，提出前向KL公式来稳定变分后验的训练，并将拒绝采样微调和二元奖励强化学习解释为局部前向KL目标。

Result: 在Qwen 2.5和Qwen 3模型系列上验证了方法的有效性，在广泛的推理任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个原则性的概率视角，统一了变分推理与强化学习方法，为改进语言模型的推理能力提供了稳定的目标函数。

Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that
treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through
variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend
it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL
formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We
further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including
GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit
weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a
previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our
method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of
reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic
perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields
stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models. Our
code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/variational-reasoning.

### [106] [Language Models Can Learn from Verbal Feedback Without Scalar Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22638)
*Renjie Luo,Zichen Liu,Xiangyan Liu,Chao Du,Min Lin,Wenhu Chen,Wei Lu,Tianyu Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出反馈条件策略(FCP)，将语言反馈作为条件信号而非标量奖励，通过最大似然训练学习反馈条件后验，并引入在线自举阶段来优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法将丰富的语言反馈压缩为标量奖励，导致信息丢失和尺度不平衡问题，需要更直接利用语言反馈的方法。

Method: FCP从响应-反馈对中直接学习，通过离线最大似然训练近似反馈条件后验，并添加在线自举阶段在积极条件下生成新响应并接收新反馈。

Result: 该方法将反馈驱动学习重新定义为条件生成而非奖励优化，为LLMs提供了更丰富的从语言反馈中学习的方式。

Conclusion: FCP框架为语言模型提供了一种更直接、更富表达力的从语言反馈中学习的方法，超越了传统的标量奖励优化范式。

Abstract: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods
typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of
their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal
feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image
generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the
feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback
pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum
likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping
stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh
feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as
conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more
expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.

### [107] [Death of the Novel(ty): Beyond n-Gram Novelty as a Metric for Textual Creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22641)
*Arkadiy Saakyan,Najoung Kim,Smaranda Muresan,Tuhin Chakrabarty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了n-gram新颖性作为创造力衡量指标的局限性，发现虽然它与专家评估的创造力正相关，但91%的高n-gram新颖性表达并未被判定为有创造力，且开源LLM的高n-gram新颖性会降低实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前n-gram新颖性被广泛用于评估语言模型的文本生成能力和创造力，但创造力理论强调需要同时考虑新颖性和适当性，而n-gram方法可能无法充分捕捉创造力的双重特性。

Method: 通过7542个专家标注（26位专家）对人工和AI生成文本的新颖性、实用性和合理性进行细读评估，并测试零样本、少样本和微调模型识别创造性表达和非实用性表达的能力。

Result: n-gram新颖性与专家评估的创造力正相关，但91%的高n-gram新颖性表达未被判定为有创造力；开源LLM的高n-gram新颖性会降低实用性；前沿闭源模型产生创造性表达的可能性低于人类。

Conclusion: 不应单独依赖n-gram新颖性来评估创造力，LLM在识别非实用性表达方面仍有改进空间，但最佳模型的LLM-as-a-Judge新颖性评分能预测专家偏好。

Abstract: N-gram novelty is widely used to evaluate language models' ability to
generate text outside of their training data. More recently, it has also been
adopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work
on creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not
account for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and
appropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the
relationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542
expert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality
via close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram
novelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of
top-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,
cautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike
human-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with
lower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source
models, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative
expressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot,
few-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a
positive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect).
Overall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave
room for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic
expressions. We further find that LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores from the
best-performing model were predictive of expert writer preferences.

*Zimu Lu,Houxing Ren,Yunqiao Yang,Ke Wang,Zhuofan Zong,Junting Pan,Mingjie Zhan,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了WebGen-Agent，一种利用多级视觉反馈迭代生成和优化网站代码库的新型网站生成代理，通过视觉语言模型分析截图和GUI测试来提供质量评分和改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代码代理在网站代码生成任务中仅依赖简单代码执行反馈，无法准确评估生成代码的实际质量，特别是视觉效果和用户交互方面。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型分析网站截图和GUI测试，生成详细文本描述、建议和质量评分；采用回溯和最优选择机制；引入Step-GRPO训练方法，使用截图和GUI代理评分作为过程监督奖励信号。

Result: 在WebGen-Bench数据集上，WebGen-Agent将Claude-3.5-Sonnet的准确率从26.4%提升至51.9%，外观评分从3.0提升至3.9；Step-GRPO训练使Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct准确率从38.9%提升至45.4%，外观评分从3.4提升至3.7。

Conclusion: WebGen-Agent通过综合视觉反馈机制显著提升了网站生成质量，证明了视觉反馈在代码生成任务中的重要性，为基于LLM的代码代理系统提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance on repository-level code-generation tasks. However, for
tasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual
effects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple
code execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture
the actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose
WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and
multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website
codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding
the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual
language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The
screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and
select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the
accurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further
introduce \textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve
the ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using
the screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, we
provide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectively
improves the model's website-generation ability. On the WebGen-Bench dataset,
WebGen-Agent increases the accuracy of Claude-3.5-Sonnet from 26.4% to 51.9%
and its appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art agent system. Additionally, our Step-GRPO training approach
increases the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from 38.9% to 45.4% and
raises the appearance score from 3.4 to 3.7.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法充分评估语音优先AI助手的完整能力范围，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 开发了包含10,497个示例的基准测试，涵盖自然声音、音乐、对话等听力任务，多轮对话、角色扮演等说话任务，以及多样化图像的视觉任务。

Result: 评估了21个开源模型和GPT-4o-Audio，发现专有模型并非普遍优于开源模型；大多数模型擅长说话任务但在音频理解方面落后；设计良好的小模型可以与更大模型竞争。

Conclusion: VoiceAssistant-Eval识别了当前模型的差距，为下一代AI助手的开发提供了严格的评估框架。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have
spurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are
inadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We
introduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI
assistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval
comprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks
include natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn
dialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly
heterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21
open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response
content and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key
findings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source
models; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;
and (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the
mid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening
accuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal
(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for
current models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety
alignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous
framework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI
assistants. Code and data will be released at
https://mathllm.github.io/VoiceAssistantEval/ .

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 产品声明对消费者购买行为至关重要，但创建过程耗时耗资。旨在通过AI技术提高声明创建的效率和经济效益。

Method: 采用上下文学习和微调大语言模型，开发具有三个功能的网络应用：语义搜索现有声明、基于产品描述和消费者画像生成优化声明、通过合成消费者模拟对声明进行排名。

Result: 在消费品包装公司应用中显示出非常有前景的结果。

Conclusion: 该能力在不同产品类别和行业中具有广泛适用性，鼓励生成式AI在各行业的研究和应用。

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

### [111] [Towards mitigating information leakage when evaluating safety monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21344)
*Gerard Boxo,Aman Neelappa,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统框架来评估白盒监控器的真实性能，避免因训练数据中的诱导信息泄露而夸大监控效果。通过内容过滤、分数过滤和微调模型生物三种策略来检测和缓解信息泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的白盒监控器在检测大型语言模型有害行为时，由于训练数据中不可避免地包含诱导行为的提示信息，导致监控性能被夸大。需要开发更准确的评估方法来衡量监控器检测真实模型行为而非表面诱导痕迹的能力。

Method: 提出了三种评估策略：内容过滤（移除输入中与欺骗相关的文本）、分数过滤（仅聚合任务相关标记的分数）、以及提示蒸馏微调模型生物（训练模型在不明确提示下展现欺骗行为）。以欺骗检测为案例研究，识别了两种信息泄露形式。

Result: 实验发现：内容过滤能平滑移除诱导信号，使监控器AUROC降低30%；分数过滤使AUROC降低15%；微调模型生物虽然改善评估但使监控性能下降高达40%，即使重新训练也是如此。

Conclusion: 白盒监控器的性能评估容易受到信息泄露的影响，需要采用系统化的评估框架来准确衡量其检测真实模型行为的能力。提出的三种策略能有效识别和缓解信息泄露问题，但也会显著降低监控器的表现性能。

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了UltraHorizon基准测试，用于评估智能体在长时程、部分可观测场景下的持续推理、规划、记忆管理和工具使用能力，发现现有LLM智能体在这些复杂任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注短时程、完全可观测任务，而现实世界中的关键任务（如软件开发、投资、科学发现）往往需要长时程推理和部分可观测环境下的能力，缺乏系统性评估基准。

Method: 通过探索任务在三个不同环境中验证核心能力，智能体需要在长时程发现任务中通过持续推理、规划、记忆和工具管理来迭代揭示隐藏规则。

Result: 在最大规模设置下，轨迹平均超过20万token和400次工具调用；标准配置下也超过3.5万token和60次工具调用。实验显示LLM智能体表现不佳，而人类参与者得分更高。

Conclusion: 现有智能体在长时程能力上存在显著差距，简单扩展方法无效。分析发现错误主要源于上下文锁定和功能基础能力差距。

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

TL;DR: RISK框架是针对电商风险管理设计的GUI代理系统，包含数据集、基准测试和强化学习微调框架，在单步和多步任务上分别提升6.8%和8.8%的性能，在线评估任务成功率高达70.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统爬虫方法和现有GUI代理无法处理电商风险管理中需要多步骤、有状态交互的复杂网页数据聚合任务，这些代理通常局限于单步任务且缺乏处理动态交互内容的能力。

Method: RISK框架包含三个组件：RISK-Data数据集（8,492单步和2,386多步交互轨迹）、RISK-Bench基准测试（802单步和320多步轨迹）、以及RISK-R1强化学习微调框架，该框架从输出格式、单步级别、多步级别和任务级别四个方面进行优化。

Result: 实验显示RISK-R1在离线单步任务上提升6.8%，离线多步任务上提升8.8%，在线评估中达到70.5%的最高任务成功率。

Conclusion: RISK为自动化复杂网页交互提供了一个可扩展的领域特定解决方案，推动了电商风险管理的技术进步。

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the
art in e-commerce risk management.

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

TL;DR: A2R是一个非对称两阶段推理框架，通过探索器并行生成多个解决方案，再由合成器整合这些参考进行更精细的推理，显著提升模型在复杂问题上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型在单次尝试中的表现与其潜在能力之间存在显著差距，需要通过多路径解决方案来揭示模型的真实潜力。

Method: 采用非对称两阶段推理框架：探索器模型通过重复采样并行生成潜在解决方案，合成器模型整合这些参考进行第二阶段的精细化推理。

Result: Qwen3-8B-distill模型性能提升75%；A2R-Efficient变体（Qwen3-4B探索器+Qwen3-8B合成器）以近30%更低的成本超越Qwen3-32B模型的平均性能。

Conclusion: A2R不仅是一个性能提升框架，也是实际应用中高效实用的解决方案，能够正交扩展计算能力。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了两个医疗专用多模态大语言模型InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B和4B，通过高质量数据筛选、高效训练方法和三阶段微调，在医疗任务中表现优于同类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用多模态大模型缺乏医疗专业知识，容易产生幻觉回答；知识蒸馏难以捕获放射学和药理学等专业领域知识；大规模医疗数据持续预训练计算成本高。

Method: 结合通用和医疗多模态数据，提出五维质量评估框架筛选高质量数据集；采用低到高图像分辨率和多模态序列打包提高训练效率；使用三阶段监督微调进行复杂医疗任务知识提取。

Result: 在MedEvalKit评估中，InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B优于Qwen2.5VL-3B，InfiMed-Foundation-4B超越HuatuoGPT-V-7B和MedGemma-27B-IT，在医疗视觉问答和诊断任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过解决数据质量、训练效率和领域知识提取等关键挑战，为医疗保健领域提供了更可靠有效的AI驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our
work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in
healthcare. InfiMed-Foundation-4B model is available at

TL;DR: PRIME是一个多智能体推理框架，通过整合人类认知的双系统理论（系统1快速直觉思维和系统2慢速深思思维），提升大型语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受《思考，快与慢》中人类双过程认知理论的启发，旨在让LLM更贴近人类认知过程，在效率和准确性之间取得平衡。

Method: 采用多智能体设计：首先由快速思考智能体（系统1）生成快速答案，如果检测到不确定性，则触发结构化的系统2推理管道，包括规划、假设生成、检索、信息整合和决策等专门智能体。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用LLaMA 3模型的PRIME框架在需要多跳和知识基础推理的基准测试中，能够与GPT-4和GPT-4o等闭源模型竞争。

Conclusion: PRIME为改进LLM在复杂、知识密集型推理领域的表现提供了一个可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick
Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is
detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains
requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic Experts Search (DES)方法，通过控制MoE模型中激活的专家数量来增强推理能力，无需额外成本即可提升准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法主要依赖输出级采样，忽视了模型架构的作用。在MoE模型中，发现改变激活专家数量可以产生互补的解决方案集，这为推理多样性提供了新的来源。

Method: DES包含两个关键组件：1) Dynamic MoE - 在推理时直接控制专家数量以生成多样化的推理轨迹；2) Expert Configuration Inheritance - 在推理路径内保持一致的专家数量，在不同运行间变化专家数量，平衡稳定性和多样性。

Result: 在MoE架构、验证器和推理基准测试（数学、代码和知识）上的广泛实验表明，DES可靠地优于TTS基线方法，无需额外成本即可提高准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: DES是一种实用且可扩展的架构感知TTS方法，展示了现代LLMs中结构灵活性如何推动推理能力的发展。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出HetaRAG框架，通过融合向量索引、知识图谱、全文搜索引擎和结构化数据库等多种检索模式，解决传统RAG系统单一存储后端的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统通常只使用单一存储后端（如向量数据库），存在不可避免的权衡：向量搜索捕获语义相似性但丢失全局上下文；知识图谱擅长关系精确性但召回率低；全文索引快速准确但语义盲；关系数据库提供强事务保证但无语义理解。

Method: 设计混合深度检索增强生成框架HetaRAG，将向量索引、知识图谱、全文引擎和结构化数据库统一到单一检索平面，动态路由和融合证据以最大化召回率、精确度和上下文保真度。

Result: 构建了初步的RAG流水线，代码已在GitHub开源。

Conclusion: 异构检索范式是互补的，通过原则性融合方案可以协同协调它们，减轻任何单一模态的弱点。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a dominant paradigm for
mitigating knowledge hallucination and staleness in large language models
(LLMs) while preserving data security. By retrieving relevant evidence from
private, domain-specific corpora and injecting it into carefully engineered
prompts, RAG delivers trustworthy responses without the prohibitive cost of
fine-tuning. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are
text-only and often rely on a single storage backend, most commonly a vector
database. In practice, this monolithic design suffers from unavoidable
trade-offs: vector search captures semantic similarity yet loses global
context; knowledge graphs excel at relational precision but struggle with
recall; full-text indexes are fast and exact yet semantically blind; and
relational engines such as MySQL provide strong transactional guarantees but no
semantic understanding. We argue that these heterogeneous retrieval paradigms
are complementary, and propose a principled fusion scheme to orchestrate them
synergistically, mitigating the weaknesses of any single modality. In this work
we introduce HetaRAG, a hybrid, deep-retrieval augmented generation framework
that orchestrates cross-modal evidence from heterogeneous data stores. We plan
to design a system that unifies vector indices, knowledge graphs, full-text
engines, and structured databases into a single retrieval plane, dynamically
routing and fusing evidence to maximize recall, precision, and contextual
fidelity. To achieve this design goal, we carried out preliminary explorations
and constructed an initial RAG pipeline; this technical report provides a brief
overview. The partial code is available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ReGeS是一个检索-生成协同框架，通过生成增强检索从对话中提取用户意图，并通过检索增强生成区分相似物品的细微特征，在对话推荐系统中实现了最先进的推荐准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话推荐系统要么需要领域特定工程而缺乏灵活性，要么仅依赖大语言模型而增加幻觉风险。RAG方法在CRS中受限于嘈杂对话削弱检索效果以及忽略相似物品间的细微差异。

Method: 提出ReGeS框架，统一生成增强检索（从对话中提炼信息性用户意图）和检索增强生成（区分细微物品特征），无需额外标注，减少幻觉，简化持续更新。

Result: 在多个CRS基准测试中，ReGeS在推荐准确率方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 检索-生成的协同效应对于知识密集型CRS任务非常有效，能够显著提升推荐性能。

Abstract: Connecting conversation with external domain knowledge is vital for
conversational recommender systems (CRS) to correctly understand user
preferences. However, existing solutions either require domain-specific
engineering, which limits flexibility, or rely solely on large language models,
which increases the risk of hallucination. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) holds promise, its naive use in CRS is hindered by noisy dialogues that
weaken retrieval and by overlooked nuances among similar items. We propose
ReGeS, a reciprocal Retrieval-Generation Synergy framework that unifies
generation-augmented retrieval to distill informative user intent from
conversations and retrieval-augmented generation to differentiate subtle item
features. This synergy obviates the need for extra annotations, reduces
hallucinations, and simplifies continuous updates. Experiments on multiple CRS
benchmarks show that ReGeS achieves state-of-the-art performance in
recommendation accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of reciprocal synergy
for knowledge-intensive CRS tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮RAG系统面临口语化省略和模糊指代的查询挑战，传统人工重写因标注者表达能力限制，导致改写查询与真实需求存在差距，需要更有效的方法来捕捉用户意图

Method: 1. 使用GPT-4o结合对话历史、当前查询、正例文档和答案生成高质量合成重写；2. 在合成数据集上微调Flan-T5模型；3. 通过DPO算法利用生成器反馈进一步优化重写器

Result: 在TopiOCQA和QRECC数据集上的实验表明，SynRewrite在检索和生成任务中均持续优于人工重写

Conclusion: 合成重写可以作为人工标注的可扩展且有效的替代方案，能更好地捕捉用户意图

Abstract: Multi-turn RAG systems often face queries with colloquial omissions and
ambiguous references, posing significant challenges for effective retrieval and
generation. Traditional query rewriting relies on human annotators to clarify
queries, but due to limitations in annotators' expressive ability and depth of
understanding, manually rewritten queries often diverge from those needed in
real-world RAG systems, resulting in a gap between user intent and system
response. We observe that high-quality synthetic queries can better bridge this
gap, achieving superior performance in both retrieval and generation compared
to human rewrites. This raises an interesting question: Can rewriting models
trained on synthetic queries better capture user intent than human annotators?
In this paper, we propose SynRewrite, a synthetic data-driven query rewriting
model to generate high-quality synthetic rewrites more aligned with user
intent. To construct training data, we prompt GPT-4o with dialogue history,
current queries, positive documents, and answers to synthesize high-quality
rewrites. A Flan-T5 model is then finetuned on this dataset to map dialogue
history and queries to synthetic rewrites. Finally, we further enhance the
rewriter using the generator's feedback through the DPO algorithm to boost
end-task performance. Experiments on TopiOCQA and QRECC datasets show that
SynRewrite consistently outperforms human rewrites in both retrieval and
generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that synthetic rewrites can serve as
a scalable and effective alternative to human annotations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估LLMs在循环不变量合成中的框架，通过验证器决策程序评估正确性和验证速度提升，发现当前LLM验证器相比传统求解器UAutomizer尚无显著优势，但监督微调和Best-of-N采样能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序验证依赖循环不变量，但自动发现强不变量仍是长期挑战，需要建立原则性框架来评估LLMs在不变量合成中的能力。

Method: 使用基于验证器的决策程序，具有形式化正确性保证，评估不变量正确性和验证速度提升，比较了7个最先进LLMs和现有LLM验证器与传统求解器UAutomizer。

Result: LLM验证器相比UAutomizer尚无显著优势，不同模型在速度提升方面差异明显，监督微调将Qwen3-Coder-480B的速度提升案例从8%提高到29.2%，Best-of-N采样将Claude-sonnet-4从8.8%提升到22.1%。

Conclusion: LLM验证器是有前景的方向但尚未超越传统求解器，模型能力至关重要，当前基准对LLMs仍是开放挑战，监督微调和采样技术能有效提升性能。

Abstract: Program verification relies on loop invariants, yet automatically discovering
strong invariants remains a long-standing challenge. We introduce a principled
framework for evaluating LLMs on invariant synthesis. Our approach uses a
verifier-based decision procedure with a formal soundness guarantee and
assesses not only correctness but also the speedup that invariants provide in
verification. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, and existing LLM-based
verifiers against the traditional solver UAutomizer. While LLM-based verifiers
represent a promising direction, they do not yet offer a significant advantage
over UAutomizer. Model capability also proves critical, as shown by sharp
differences in speedups across models, and our benchmark remains an open
challenge for current LLMs. Finally, we show that supervised fine-tuning and
Best-of-N sampling can improve performance: fine-tuning on 3589 instances
raises the percentage of speedup cases for Qwen3-Coder-480B from 8% to 29.2%,
and Best-of-N sampling with N=16 improves Claude-sonnet-4 from 8.8% to 22.1%.

Motivation: 验证证明编码了完整的程序行为，但在检查正确性后就被丢弃了，这是一种资源浪费

Method: 通过符号执行构建全路径可达性证明，并编译其图结构，将多个语义重写整合为单一规则，同时通过构造保持正确性

Result: 在K框架中实现了语言无关的扩展，评估显示在不同编译范围内都获得了性能提升：操作码级优化显示一致的加速，而全程序编译实现了数量级更大的性能增益

Conclusion: 通过证明编译是一种有效的优化方法，能够将验证证明转化为高效的执行规则，显著提升程序性能

Abstract: Verification proofs encode complete program behavior, yet we discard them
after checking correctness. We present compiling by proving, a paradigm that
transforms these proofs into optimized execution rules. By constructing
All-Path Reachability Proofs through symbolic execution and compiling their
graph structure, we consolidate many semantic rewrites into single rules while
preserving correctness by construction. We implement this as a
language-agnostic extension to the K framework. Evaluation demonstrates
performance improvements across different compilation scopes: opcode-level
optimizations show consistent speedups, while whole-program compilation
achieves orders of magnitude greater performance gains.

Conclusion: 这是第一个在所有模型参数中具有多项式缩放遗憾的在线RLHF算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward
model from human preference data and then optimizes a policy to favor preferred
responses, has emerged as a central paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate exploration
principles for online RLHF, where one seeks to adaptively collect new
preference data to refine both the reward model and the policy in a
data-efficient manner. By examining existing optimism-based exploration
algorithms, we identify a drawback in their sampling protocol: they tend to
gather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties in
reward differences, and we prove lower bounds showing that such methods can
incur linear regret over exponentially long horizons. Motivated by this
insight, we propose a new exploration scheme that directs preference queries
toward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy
improvement. Under a multi-armed bandit model of RLHF, we establish regret
bounds of order $T^{(\beta+1)/(\beta+2)}$, where $\beta>0$ is a hyperparameter
that balances reward maximization against mitigating distribution shift. To our
knowledge, this is the first online RLHF algorithm with regret scaling
polynomially in all model parameters.

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional

TL;DR: VideoJudge是一个专门用于评估视频理解模型输出的多模态大语言模型，通过生成器-评估器交互训练方法，在多个基准测试中超越了更大的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标（如BLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore）无法捕捉人类判断的精细度，而人工评估成本高昂。多模态大语言模型在视频理解评估方面的应用仍相对不足。

Method: 采用生成器-评估器交互训练方法：生成器根据目标评分生成响应，不匹配评估器评分的响应被丢弃，从而训练专门的视频评估模型。

Result: 在四个元评估基准中的三个，VideoJudge-7B超越了更大的基线模型（如Qwen2.5-VL 32B和72B）。发现纯文本LLM评估器表现不如多模态LLM，且长链推理不能提升性能。

Conclusion: 视频输入对于视频理解任务的评估至关重要，VideoJudge展示了专门化多模态评估模型的有效性。

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

TL;DR: 研究显示当前主流文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特职业形象时存在严重的性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，其中DALL-E V3性别偏见最严重，生成图像96%为男性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查当代文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特职业形象时是否延续性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，揭示算法偏见问题。

Method: 使用ImageFX、DALL-E V3和Grok三个模型生成1,006张沙特职业图像，由两名沙特标注员从五个维度评估，第三方资深研究员仲裁分歧，共获得10,100个判断。

Result: 所有模型都显示强烈性别不平衡：ImageFX 85%男性、Grok 86.6%男性、DALL-E V3 96%男性，领导和技术职位偏见最严重。文化准确性方面也存在服装、场景和活动的不准确描绘。

Conclusion: 当前模型反映了训练数据中的人类社会偏见，对沙特劳动力市场的性别动态和文化细微差别呈现有限。需要更多样化的训练数据、更公平的算法和文化敏感的评估框架。

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

TL;DR: 将GUI定位重新定义为交互式搜索任务，通过光标移动来定位UI元素，而非直接预测坐标，解决了VLMs在高分辨率GUI图像中坐标预测不准的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将GUI定位视为坐标预测任务，但VLMs在处理高分辨率复杂布局的GUI图像时难以准确预测数字坐标。

Method: 提出GUI-Cursor模型，将GUI定位重构为交互式搜索任务：模型生成动作移动光标来定位UI元素，通过多步在线强化学习和基于轨迹的密集奖励函数进行训练。

Result: 基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B的GUI-Cursor在ScreenSpot-v2（88.8%→93.9%）和ScreenSpot-Pro（26.8%→56.5%）上实现了最先进的结果，95%的实例在两步内解决问题。

Conclusion: 交互式搜索方法比直接坐标预测更有效，GUI-Cursor能够自适应地处理不同难度的实例，在GUI定位任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

TL;DR: UISim是一个基于图像的UI模拟器，通过两阶段方法从屏幕图像预测和合成新的UI状态，用于移动界面测试和AI代理训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖笨重的物理设备或有限的静态截图分析，难以实现可扩展的UI测试和智能UI代理开发。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：给定初始屏幕图像和用户操作，先预测下一个UI状态的抽象布局，然后基于预测布局合成视觉一致的新图像。

Result: UISim在生成真实且连贯的后续UI状态方面优于端到端UI生成基线方法。

Conclusion: UISim为UI测试、快速原型设计和合成数据生成提供了实用价值，并为AI代理的UI导航任务规划等高级应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

Motivation: 有害在线内容的增加扭曲了公共话语，对维持健康数字环境构成挑战，需要开发有效的仇恨内容检测和去除方法。

Method: 使用水印稳定扩散技术和数字注意力分析模块(DAAM)来定位图像中的仇恨元素，生成仇恨注意力地图，并通过模糊处理移除仇恨区域。

Result: 创建了专门的多模态数据集，开发了DeHater视觉语言模型，为AI驱动的图像仇恨检测设定了新标准。

Conclusion: 该方法为社交媒体中更符合伦理的AI应用开发做出了贡献，推动了数字环境中仇恨内容的有效识别和去除。

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but
also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment.
In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for
identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the
innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion
techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This
combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images,
thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these
regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We
release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a
vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our
approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual
prompts, contributing to the development of more ethical AI applications in

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了大型视觉语言模型的空间偏见问题，发现模型对相同视觉信息在不同位置的响应不一致，并提出平衡位置分配机制来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中取得了显著成功，但其对空间变化的鲁棒性尚未被充分理解。研究人员希望探究当相同关键视觉信息放置在不同位置时，模型是否会产生不一致的输出。

Method: 通过精心设计的探测数据集分析LVLMs的空间偏见，发现问题的根源在于语言模型中位置嵌入的不平衡设计。提出平衡位置分配机制，为所有图像标记分配相同的位置嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，BaPA无需重新训练即可增强LVLMs的空间鲁棒性，结合轻量级微调还能进一步提升在各种多模态基准测试中的性能。信息流分析显示BaPA产生了更平衡的注意力机制。

Conclusion: 当前LVLMs存在显著的空间偏见问题，主要源于位置嵌入的不平衡设计。BaPA机制通过为所有图像标记分配相同位置嵌入，有效提升了模型的空间鲁棒性和整体视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

TL;DR: ERGO提出了一种两阶段"粗到细"推理框架，通过先分析下采样图像识别任务相关区域，然后仅对相关区域进行全分辨率处理，显著减少计算成本同时保持必要的视觉细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致计算开销巨大。随着"图像思维"模型的出现，推理能力扩展到视觉领域，这启发了粗到细的推理方法。

Method: 采用两阶段推理：第一阶段分析下采样图像识别相关区域；第二阶段仅对相关区域进行全分辨率处理。提出ERGO模型，利用多模态上下文进行推理驱动的感知，通过强化学习框架处理感知不确定性。

Result: 在多个数据集上，ERGO比原始模型和竞争方法获得更高准确率且效率更高。例如，在V*基准测试中超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B 4.7分，仅使用23%的视觉token，实现3倍推理加速。

Conclusion: ERGO通过推理驱动的感知方法有效解决了高分辨率图像处理的计算效率问题，在保持准确性的同时大幅提升了效率。

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

Motivation: 解决文档解析中高分辨率输入处理的计算开销问题，同时保持对密集文本、复杂公式和表格等细粒度细节的识别能力。

Method: 采用两阶段解析策略：第一阶段对下采样图像进行高效布局分析，识别结构元素；第二阶段基于全局布局指导，对原始图像的原生分辨率裁剪区域进行针对性内容识别。

Conclusion: MinerU2.5展示了强大的文档解析能力，通过粗到细的两阶段策略有效平衡了识别精度和计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

TL;DR: 该论文探索使用2D高斯泼溅(2DGS)作为视觉语言模型的替代视觉表示，以解决RGB图像传输和序列长度爆炸的问题，实现了高效的图像压缩和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RGB视觉编码器在边缘设备到云端传输时的两个结构性问题：(i)密集RGB图像传输能耗高、成本大；(ii)基于patch的标记化导致序列长度爆炸，增加注意力计算负担。

Method: 开发可扩展的2DGS流水线，包括结构化初始化、亮度感知剪枝和批量CUDA内核；通过重用冻结的RGB变换器骨干网络，结合轻量级泼溅感知输入干和感知器重采样器，仅训练约7%参数来适应对比语言图像预训练(CLIP)。

Result: 实现了超过90倍的拟合加速和约97%的GPU利用率；在DataComp子集上，GS编码器在压缩输入3到20倍的同时，仍能获得有意义的零样本ImageNet-1K性能。

Conclusion: 2DGS被确立为可行的多模态基底，虽然当前精度仍落后于RGB编码器，但为开发既语义强大又传输高效的边缘-云端学习表示开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

Motivation: 构建高质量、领域特定的数据集是部署稳健视觉系统的主要瓶颈，需要在数据质量、多样性和成本之间进行复杂权衡，特别是在处理大规模未标记数据时。

Method: 使用多模态语言模型驱动的中央编排器进行多步推理，执行三个核心工具：校准发现（从大型存储库中获取相关数据）、可控合成（为罕见场景生成新数据）和共识标注（通过非极大值抑制和投票机制协调多个基础模型产生准确标签）。

Conclusion: 具有优化、可扩展工具的代理工作流程为整理工业规模数据集提供了稳健基础。

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

Motivation: 视频生成模型快速发展，但人类能否检测深度伪造痕迹这一关键维度被忽视，需要建立能够识别时空视觉伪影的基准。

Method: 构建包含4.3K详细标注的数据集，每个标注提供自然语言解释、边界框区域和精确时间戳，将标注整合为9类深度伪造痕迹，训练多模态语言模型作为奖励模型。

Result: 7B奖励模型在伪造线索识别、定位和解释方面平均优于GPT-5 34.7%，观察到一致的难度梯度：二元分类最容易，自然语言解释次之，空间定位和时间标注最难。

Conclusion: 通过突出人类感知的深度伪造痕迹，DeeptraceReward为社会意识和可信视频生成提供了严格的测试平台和训练信号。

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 开发了一个从国会听证会转录本中提取问答对的流程，构建了第108-117届国会委员会听证会的新数据集，揭示了不同政党在提问策略上的系统性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治访谈和听证会中的问题具有超越信息收集的战略目的，但由于缺乏大规模数据集，这些战略方面研究不足。国会听证会为研究政治提问提供了丰富且易于处理的场所。

Method: 开发了一个从非结构化听证会转录本中提取问答对的流程，构建了第108-117届国会委员会听证会的新数据集，通过问题内容预测提问者的党派归属。

Result: 分析显示不同政党在提问策略上存在系统性差异，仅从问题内容就能预测提问者的党派归属。

Conclusion: 该数据集和方法不仅推进了国会政治研究，还为分析类似访谈场景中的问答提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Questions in political interviews and hearings serve strategic purposes
beyond information gathering including advancing partisan narratives and
shaping public perceptions. However, these strategic aspects remain
understudied due to the lack of large-scale datasets for studying such
discourse. Congressional hearings provide an especially rich and tractable site
for studying political questioning: Interactions are structured by formal
rules, witnesses are obliged to respond, and members with different political
affiliations are guaranteed opportunities to ask questions, enabling
comparisons of behaviors across the political spectrum.
  We develop a pipeline to extract question-answer pairs from unstructured
hearing transcripts and construct a novel dataset of committee hearings from
the 108th--117th Congress. Our analysis reveals systematic differences in
questioning strategies across parties, by showing the party affiliation of
questioners can be predicted from their questions alone. Our dataset and
methods not only advance the study of congressional politics, but also provide
a general framework for analyzing question-answering across interview-like
settings.

TL;DR: AgentPack是一个包含130万代码编辑的数据集，由Claude Code、OpenAI Codex和Cursor Agent在GitHub项目中共同创作，相比传统提交数据质量更高，可用于训练更好的代码编辑模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于提交和拉取请求的代码编辑训练数据存在噪声问题：提交信息简短、人类提交混杂多个无关编辑、许多提交来自简单的基于规则的机器人。

Method: 收集GitHub上截至2025年8月中的公开项目数据，识别和筛选由软件工程代理（Claude Code、OpenAI Codex、Cursor Agent）共同创作的代码编辑，构建AgentPack数据集。

Result: 构建了包含130万代码编辑的AgentPack语料库，量化了这些代理的采用趋势，分析了编辑的结构特性。在AgentPack上微调的模型优于在传统人类提交语料库上训练的模型。

Conclusion: 利用软件工程代理产生的公开数据训练代码编辑模型具有巨大潜力，AgentPack数据集为未来代码编辑模型的训练提供了更高质量的数据源。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models for code editing has typically relied on
mining commits and pull requests. The working hypothesis has been that commit
messages describe human intent in natural language, and patches to code
describe the changes that implement that intent. However, much of the
previously collected data is noisy: commit messages are terse, human-written
commits commingle several unrelated edits, and many commits come from simple,
rule-based bots.
  The recent adoption of software engineering agents changes this landscape.
Code changes co-authored by humans and agents tend to be more narrowly scoped
and focused on clearer goals. Their commit messages, generated by LLMs,
articulate intent and rationale in much greater detail. Moreover, when these
changes land in public repositories, they are implicitly filtered by humans:
maintainers discard low-quality commits to their projects.
  We present AgentPack, a corpus of 1.3M code edits co-authored by Claude Code,
OpenAI Codex, and Cursor Agent across public GitHub projects up to mid-August
2025. We describe the identification and curation pipeline, quantify adoption
trends of these agents, and analyze the structural properties of the edits.
Finally, we show that models fine-tuned on AgentPack can outperform models
trained on prior human-only commit corpora, highlighting the potential of using
public data from software engineering agents to train future code-editing
models.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SecureAgentBench是一个包含105个编码任务的基准测试，用于严格评估代码代理在安全代码生成方面的能力。评估结果显示当前代理在生成安全代码方面表现不佳，即使最佳代理也只能达到15.2%的正确且安全解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLM驱动的代码代理时存在不足：忽略了漏洞引入的真实上下文，或采用狭窄的评估协议无法捕捉功能正确性或新引入的漏洞。

Method: SecureAgentBench包含三个关键设计：(i)需要在大仓库中进行多文件编辑的现实任务设置，(ii)基于真实开源漏洞的上下文，(iii)结合功能测试、漏洞检查和静态分析的综合评估。评估了三种代表性代理和三种最先进的LLM。

Result: 结果显示：(i)当前代理难以生成安全代码，最佳表现者仅达到15.2%正确且安全的解决方案，(ii)某些代理生成功能正确但引入漏洞的代码，(iii)添加明确安全指令对改善安全编码无显著帮助。

Conclusion: SecureAgentBench为安全代码生成建立了严格基准，是迈向更可靠LLM软件开发的重要一步，突显了进一步研究的必要性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) powered code agents are rapidly transforming
software engineering by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and
repairing, yet the security risks of their generated code have become a
critical concern. Existing benchmarks have offered valuable insights but remain
insufficient: they often overlook the genuine context in which vulnerabilities
were introduced or adopt narrow evaluation protocols that fail to capture
either functional correctness or newly introduced vulnerabilities. We therefore
introduce SecureAgentBench, a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to
rigorously evaluate code agents' capabilities in secure code generation. Each
task includes (i) realistic task settings that require multi-file edits in
large repositories, (ii) aligned contexts based on real-world open-source
vulnerabilities with precisely identified introduction points, and (iii)
comprehensive evaluation that combines functionality testing, vulnerability
checking through proof-of-concept exploits, and detection of newly introduced
vulnerabilities using static analysis. We evaluate three representative agents
(SWE-agent, OpenHands, and Aider) with three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7
Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1). Results show that (i) current agents
struggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent
supported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions,
(ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce
vulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding
explicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure
coding, underscoring the need for further research. These findings establish
SecureAgentBench as a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and a step
toward more reliable software development with LLMs.

TL;DR: 系统研究提示变化对LLM代码生成中库幻觉的影响，发现单字符拼写错误可导致26%任务产生幻觉，虚假库名被接受率高达99%，时间相关提示幻觉率84%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成代码时经常产生库幻觉，这些幻觉不仅是良性错误，还会误导开发者、破坏构建过程，并可能带来供应链安全威胁。目前缺乏关于真实世界提示变化如何影响幻觉率的系统性研究。

Method: 评估6个不同的LLM，研究两种幻觉类型：库名幻觉（无效导入）和库成员幻觉（有效库中的无效调用）。分析来自开发者论坛的真实用户语言，以及不同程度用户错误（单字符/多字符拼写错误和完全虚假名称/成员）对幻觉率的影响。

Result: 发现系统性漏洞：库名单字符拼写错误在26%任务中触发幻觉，虚假库名被接受率高达99%，时间相关提示幻觉率84%。提示工程有缓解潜力但效果不一致且依赖具体LLM。

Conclusion: LLM对自然提示变化极其脆弱，迫切需要针对库相关幻觉及其潜在利用的安全防护措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, yet they
continue to hallucinate, often inventing non-existent libraries. Such library
hallucinations are not just benign errors: they can mislead developers, break
builds, and expose systems to supply chain threats such as slopsquatting.
Despite increasing awareness of these risks, little is known about how
real-world prompt variations affect hallucination rates. Therefore, we present
the first systematic study of how user-level prompt variations impact library
hallucinations in LLM-generated code. We evaluate six diverse LLMs across two
hallucination types: library name hallucinations (invalid imports) and library
member hallucinations (invalid calls from valid libraries). We investigate how
realistic user language extracted from developer forums and how user errors of
varying degrees (one- or multi-character misspellings and completely fake
names/members) affect LLM hallucination rates. Our findings reveal systemic
vulnerabilities: one-character misspellings in library names trigger
hallucinations in up to 26% of tasks, fake library names are accepted in up to
99% of tasks, and time-related prompts lead to hallucinations in up to 84% of
tasks. Prompt engineering shows promise for mitigating hallucinations, but
remains inconsistent and LLM-dependent. Our results underscore the fragility of
LLMs to natural prompt variation and highlight the urgent need for safeguards
against library-related hallucinations and their potential exploitation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various fields. However, their performance in technical domains such as
telecommunications remains underexplored. This paper evaluates two open-source
LLMs, Gemma 3 27B and DeepSeek R1 32B, on factual and reasoning-based questions
derived from advanced wireless communications material. We construct a
benchmark of 105 question-answer pairs and assess performance using lexical
metrics, semantic similarity, and LLM-as-a-judge scoring. We also analyze
consistency, judgment reliability, and hallucination through source attribution
and score variance. Results show that Gemma excels in semantic fidelity and
LLM-rated correctness, while DeepSeek demonstrates slightly higher lexical
consistency. Additional findings highlight current limitations in telecom

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VLM的方法将动作预测视为文本生成任务，但作者认为空中视觉语言导航的动作预测更适合作为2D空间定位任务来处理。

Method: 利用VLM将模糊语言指令分解为输入图像上的迭代2D航点标注，结合预测的飞行距离，将2D航点转换为3D位移向量作为无人机动作命令，并自适应调整飞行距离。

Result: 在DRL仿真基准测试中达到新的SOTA，比之前最佳方法绝对提升63%；在真实世界评估中大幅超越强基线方法。

Conclusion: SPF展示了出色的泛化能力，能够适应不同的VLM模型，为空中视觉语言导航提供了一种有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language
navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is
capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions
in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that
treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to
consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF
harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative
annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted
traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement
vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the
traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF
performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow
dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL
simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute
margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong
baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to
highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable
generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev

TL;DR: 该研究通过比较40名人类参与者与AI数字孪生在Amazon Rufus购物任务中的表现，量化了LLM代理模拟人类与智能AI系统多轮互动的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能AI系统（如Copilot、Amazon Rufus）的快速发展，传统人工评估方法难以跟上其迭代速度。研究者提出使用LLM代理作为数字孪生来模拟参与者，但尚不清楚数字孪生能在多大程度上代表特定客户与智能AI系统的多轮交互。

Method: 招募40名人类参与者使用Amazon Rufus购物，收集其个人资料、交互轨迹和用户体验反馈，然后创建数字孪生重复相同任务，并进行成对比较分析。

Result: 数字孪生虽然探索了更多样化的选择，但其行为模式与人类保持一致，并产生了相似的设计反馈。

Conclusion: 这是首个量化LLM代理模拟人类与智能AI系统多轮交互能力的研究，证明了数字孪生在可扩展评估中的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic AI is emerging, capable of executing tasks through natural language,
such as Copilot for coding or Amazon Rufus for shopping. Evaluating these
systems is challenging, as their rapid evolution outpaces traditional human
evaluation. Researchers have proposed LLM Agents to simulate participants as
digital twins, but it remains unclear to what extent a digital twin can
represent a specific customer in multi-turn interaction with an agentic AI
system. In this paper, we recruited 40 human participants to shop with Amazon
Rufus, collected their personas, interaction traces, and UX feedback, and then
created digital twins to repeat the task. Pairwise comparison of human and
digital-twin traces shows that while agents often explored more diverse
choices, their action patterns aligned with humans and yielded similar design
feedback. This study is the first to quantify how closely LLM agents can mirror
human multi-turn interaction with an agentic AI system, highlighting their
potential for scalable evaluation.

Motivation: 解决如何使LLM代理模拟真正对政策制定有用的问题，推动LLM代理在社会模拟中的实际应用。

Method: 与大学应急准备团队进行迭代设计合作，开发大规模LLM代理系统模拟人群移动和通信，并进行多种紧急情景模拟。

Result: 模拟结果实际影响了政策实施，包括志愿者培训、疏散协议和基础设施规划。

Conclusion: 提出了三个设计启示：从可验证情景开始逐步建立信任、使用初步模拟获取隐性知识、将模拟与政策发展视为共同演进过程。

Abstract: There is growing interest in using Large Language Models as agents (LLM
agents) for social simulations to inform policy, yet real-world adoption
remains limited. This paper addresses the question: How can LLM agent
simulations be made genuinely useful for policy? We report on a year-long
iterative design engagement with a university emergency preparedness team.
Across multiple design iterations, we iteratively developed a system of 13,000
LLM agents that simulate crowd movement and communication during a large-scale
gathering under various emergency scenarios. These simulations informed actual
policy implementation, shaping volunteer training, evacuation protocols, and
infrastructure planning. Analyzing this process, we identify three design
implications: start with verifiable scenarios and build trust gradually, use
preliminary simulations to elicit tacit knowledge, and treat simulation and
policy development as evolving together. These implications highlight
actionable pathways to making LLM agent simulations that are genuinely useful
for policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Replika等AI伴侣聊天机器人日益流行，它们提供了共情互动，但其心理社会影响尚不明确，需要系统研究这些技术如何影响用户福祉。

Method: 采用混合方法：1)大规模准实验研究，使用分层倾向得分匹配和双重差分回归分析Reddit纵向数据；2)15个半结构化访谈的主题分析，结合Knapp关系发展模型进行情境化。

Result: 发现混合效应：积极方面包括情感和悲伤表达增加、可读性提高、人际关注增强；负面方面包括孤独和自杀意念相关语言增加。访谈揭示了关系发展的启动、升级和绑定轨迹。

Conclusion: AI伴侣应设计为支持健康边界、促进正念参与、支持披露但不产生依赖、明确关系阶段，以最大化心理社会效益同时减轻风险。

Abstract: AI-powered companion chatbots (AICCs) such as Replika are increasingly
popular, offering empathetic interactions, yet their psychosocial impacts
remain unclear. We examined how engaging with AICCs shaped wellbeing and how
users perceived these experiences. First, we conducted a large-scale
quasi-experimental study of longitudinal Reddit data, applying stratified
propensity score matching and Difference-in-Differences regression. Findings
revealed mixed effects -- greater affective and grief expression, readability,
and interpersonal focus, alongside increases in language about loneliness and
suicidal ideation. Second, we complemented these results with 15
semi-structured interviews, which we thematically analyzed and contextualized
using Knapp's relationship development model. We identified trajectories of
initiation, escalation, and bonding, wherein AICCs provided emotional
validation and social rehearsal but also carried risks of over-reliance and
withdrawal. Triangulating across methods, we offer design implications for AI
companions that scaffold healthy boundaries, support mindful engagement,
support disclosure without dependency, and surface relationship stages --
maximizing psychosocial benefits while mitigating risks.

Motivation: 工作场所谈判受到心理障碍的困扰，AI提供个性化谈判辅导，但其在谈判准备方面的有效性尚不明确。

Method: 开发基于Brett谈判模型的AI教练Trucey，进行267人对比实验（Trucey vs ChatGPT vs 传统手册），并进行15人深度访谈。

Result: Trucey在减少恐惧方面表现最强，但手册在可用性和心理赋权方面优于两个AI系统。访谈显示手册的全面、可回顾内容对参与者信心至关重要。

Abstract: Workplace negotiations are undermined by psychological barriers, which can
even derail well-prepared tactics. AI offers personalized and always --
available negotiation coaching, yet its effectiveness for negotiation
preparedness remains unclear. We built Trucey, a prototype AI coach grounded in
Brett's negotiation model. We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N=267),
comparing Trucey, ChatGPT, and a traditional negotiation Handbook, followed by
in-depth interviews (N=15). While Trucey showed the strongest reductions in
fear relative to both comparison conditions, the Handbook outperformed both AIs
in usability and psychological empowerment. Interviews revealed that the
Handbook's comprehensive, reviewable content was crucial for participants'
confidence and preparedness. In contrast, although participants valued AI's
rehearsal capability, its guidance often felt verbose and fragmented --
delivered in bits and pieces that required additional effort -- leaving them
uncertain or overwhelmed. These findings challenge assumptions of AI
superiority and motivate hybrid designs that integrate structured,
theory-driven content with targeted rehearsal, clear boundaries, and adaptive
scaffolds to address psychological barriers and support negotiation
preparedness.

*Jingkai Guo,Chaitali Chakrabarti,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SBFA是一种隐蔽的位翻转攻击方法，仅需翻转单个比特就能使大语言模型性能崩溃，同时保持扰动值在良性权重分布范围内，揭示了SOTA LLM模型严重的安全隐患。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位翻转攻击方法通常分别针对整数或浮点数模型，限制了攻击灵活性。在浮点数模型中，随机位翻转往往导致参数变为极端值，不够隐蔽且可能引发数值运行时错误。

Method: 提出SBFA方法，通过定义的参数敏感度指标ImpactScore（结合梯度敏感性和受良性层间权重分布约束的扰动范围）进行迭代搜索和排序，并引入轻量级SKIP搜索算法大幅降低搜索复杂度。

Result: 在Qwen、LLaMA和Gemma模型上，仅翻转单个比特就成功将MMLU和SST-2的准确率降至随机水平以下，且适用于BF16和INT8两种数据格式。

Conclusion: 仅翻转数十亿参数中的一个比特就能导致SOTA LLM模型性能崩溃，这揭示了严重的安全问题。

Abstract: Model integrity of Large language models (LLMs) has become a pressing
security concern with their massive online deployment. Prior Bit-Flip Attacks
(BFAs) -- a class of popular AI weight memory fault-injection techniques -- can
severely compromise Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): as few as tens of bit flips
can degrade accuracy toward random guessing. Recent studies extend BFAs to LLMs
and reveal that, despite the intuition of better robustness from modularity and
redundancy, only a handful of adversarial bit flips can also cause LLMs'
catastrophic accuracy degradation. However, existing BFA methods typically
focus on either integer or floating-point models separately, limiting attack
flexibility. Moreover, in floating-point models, random bit flips often cause
perturbed parameters to extreme values (e.g., flipping in exponent bit), making
it not stealthy and leading to numerical runtime error (e.g., invalid tensor
values (NaN/Inf)). In this work, for the first time, we propose SBFA (Sneaky
Bit-Flip Attack), which collapses LLM performance with only one single bit flip
while keeping perturbed values within benign layer-wise weight distribution. It
is achieved through iterative searching and ranking through our defined
parameter sensitivity metric, ImpactScore, which combines gradient sensitivity
and perturbation range constrained by the benign layer-wise weight
distribution. A novel lightweight SKIP searching algorithm is also proposed to
greatly reduce searching complexity, which leads to successful SBFA searching
taking only tens of minutes for SOTA LLMs. Across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma
models, with only one single bit flip, SBFA successfully degrades accuracy to
below random levels on MMLU and SST-2 in both BF16 and INT8 data formats.
Remarkably, flipping a single bit out of billions of parameters reveals a
severe security concern of SOTA LLM models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单有效的系统提示词泄露攻击方法，并开发了SysVec解决方案，通过将系统提示词编码为内部表示向量而非原始文本来防止泄露，同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM应用广泛使用定制化系统提示词，但面临泄露风险。现有防护措施主要通过阻止模型重复上下文来防止已知攻击模式，但对新型攻击仍然脆弱。

Method: 首先提出一种有效的提示词泄露攻击方法，然后开发SysVec解决方案，将系统提示词编码为内部表示向量，避免在上下文中暴露原始文本。

Result: 攻击方法能够从GPT-4o、Claude 3.5 Sonnet等SOTA模型中提取系统提示词。SysVec不仅能有效缓解提示词泄露攻击，还提升了模型的指令跟随能力，并在长上下文场景中缓解遗忘问题。

Conclusion: SysVec通过向量化编码系统提示词，在保障安全性的同时提升了模型性能，为解决提示词泄露问题提供了根本性解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted across various
applications, leveraging customized system prompts for diverse tasks. Facing
potential system prompt leakage risks, model developers have implemented
strategies to prevent leakage, primarily by disabling LLMs from repeating their
context when encountering known attack patterns. However, it remains vulnerable
to new and unforeseen prompt-leaking techniques. In this paper, we first
introduce a simple yet effective prompt leaking attack to reveal such risks.
Our attack is capable of extracting system prompts from various LLM-based
application, even from SOTA LLM models such as GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our
findings further inspire us to search for a fundamental solution to the
problems by having no system prompt in the context. To this end, we propose
SysVec, a novel method that encodes system prompts as internal representation
vectors rather than raw text. By doing so, SysVec minimizes the risk of
unauthorized disclosure while preserving the LLM's core language capabilities.
Remarkably, this approach not only enhances security but also improves the
model's general instruction-following abilities. Experimental results
demonstrate that SysVec effectively mitigates prompt leakage attacks, preserves
the LLM's functional integrity, and helps alleviate the forgetting issue in
long-context scenarios.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注静态或单场景设置，无法充分捕捉多个说话者、展开事件和异构音频源交互的场景，需要更全面的音频推理评估基准。

Method: 开发了MDAR基准测试，包含3000个问答对，链接到多样化的音频片段，涵盖五种复杂推理类别（多说话者、事件演化、异构音频等）和三种问题类型（单选、多选、开放式）。

Result: 评估了26个最先进的音频语言模型，发现它们在复杂推理任务中存在局限性。Qwen2.5-Omni在单选问题上达到76.67%准确率，GPT-4o Audio为68.47%；但在更具挑战性的多选和开放式任务中，GPT-4o Audio显著优于Qwen2.5-Omni。所有模型在三种问题类型上均未达到80%性能。

Conclusion: MDAR基准测试揭示了音频推理面临的独特挑战，其作为推进音频推理研究的基准具有重要价值，当前模型在复杂音频推理任务上仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: The ability to reason from audio, including speech, paralinguistic cues,
environmental sounds, and music, is essential for AI agents to interact
effectively in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on static
or single-scene settings and do not fully capture scenarios where multiple
speakers, unfolding events, and heterogeneous audio sources interact. To
address these challenges, we introduce MDAR, a benchmark for evaluating models
on complex, multi-scene, and dynamically evolving audio reasoning tasks. MDAR
comprises 3,000 carefully curated question-answer pairs linked to diverse audio
clips, covering five categories of complex reasoning and spanning three
question types. We benchmark 26 state-of-the-art audio language models on MDAR
and observe that they exhibit limitations in complex reasoning tasks. On
single-choice questions, Qwen2.5-Omni (open-source) achieves 76.67% accuracy,
whereas GPT-4o Audio (closed-source) reaches 68.47%; however, GPT-4o Audio
substantially outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni on the more challenging multiple-choice
and open-ended tasks. Across all three question types, no model achieves 80%
performance. These findings underscore the unique challenges posed by MDAR and
its value as a benchmark for advancing audio reasoning research.Code and
benchmark can be found at https://github.com/luckyerr/MDAR.

Conclusion: ARTI-6提供了一个可解释、计算高效且生理学基础的框架，能够显著推进发音反演、合成和更广泛的语音技术应用发展。

Abstract: We propose ARTI-6, a compact six-dimensional articulatory speech encoding
framework derived from real-time MRI data that captures crucial vocal tract
regions including the velum, tongue root, and larynx. ARTI-6 consists of three
components: (1) a six-dimensional articulatory feature set representing key
regions of the vocal tract; (2) an articulatory inversion model, which predicts
articulatory features from speech acoustics leveraging speech foundation
models, achieving a prediction correlation of 0.87; and (3) an articulatory
synthesis model, which reconstructs intelligible speech directly from
articulatory features, showing that even a low-dimensional representation can
generate natural-sounding speech. Together, ARTI-6 provides an interpretable,
computationally efficient, and physiologically grounded framework for advancing
articulatory inversion, synthesis, and broader speech technology applications.
The source code and speech samples are publicly available.

Abstract: With the prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content, such
as audio deepfakes, a large body of recent work has focused on developing
deepfake detection techniques. However, most models are evaluated on a narrow
set of datasets, leaving their generalization to real-world conditions
uncertain. In this paper, we systematically review 28 existing audio deepfake
datasets and present an open-source benchmarking toolkit called AUDDT
(https://github.com/MuSAELab/AUDDT). The goal of this toolkit is to automate
the evaluation of pretrained detectors across these 28 datasets, giving users
direct feedback on the advantages and shortcomings of their deepfake detectors.
We start by showcasing the usage of the developed toolkit, the composition of
our benchmark, and the breakdown of different deepfake subgroups. Next, using a
widely adopted pretrained deepfake detector, we present in- and out-of-domain
detection results, revealing notable differences across conditions and audio
manipulation types. Lastly, we also analyze the limitations of these existing
datasets and their gap relative to practical deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估语音延续任务中的偏见，研究性别和发声类型对语音基础模型延续行为的影响，发现存在显著的性别偏见和发声质量偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音延续任务提供比对话更直接的设置来探测语音基础模型中的偏见，因为其约束在单一音频流中，能更好地保留语义上下文和说话人身份。

Method: 评估三个最新模型：SpiritLM（基础和表达版本）、VAE-GSLM和SpeechGPT，使用说话人相似性、声音质量保持和基于文本的偏见指标。

Result: 结果显示：一旦连贯性足够高（如VAE-GSLM），在文本指标上出现显著的模型和性别交互作用；女性提示的发声质量更容易向标准发声回归，揭示系统性声音质量偏见。

Conclusion: 语音延续可作为语音基础模型中社会相关表征偏见的受控探测工具，随着延续质量的提高，它将提供越来越丰富的信息诊断价值。

Abstract: Speech Continuation (SC) is the task of generating a coherent extension of a
spoken prompt while preserving both semantic context and speaker identity.
Because SC is constrained to a single audio stream, it offers a more direct
setting for probing biases in speech foundation models than dialogue does. In
this work we present the first systematic evaluation of bias in SC,
investigating how gender and phonation type (breathy, creaky, end-creak) affect
continuation behaviour. We evaluate three recent models: SpiritLM (base and
expressive), VAE-GSLM, and SpeechGPT across speaker similarity, voice quality
preservation, and text-based bias metrics. Results show that while both speaker
similarity and coherence remain a challenge, textual evaluations reveal
significant model and gender interactions: once coherence is sufficiently high
(for VAE-GSLM), gender effects emerge on text-metrics such as agency and
sentence polarity. In addition, continuations revert toward modal phonation
more strongly for female prompts than for male ones, revealing a systematic
voice-quality bias. These findings highlight SC as a controlled probe of
socially relevant representational biases in speech foundation models, and
suggest that it will become an increasingly informative diagnostic as
continuation quality improves.

Motivation: 评估LLMs是否能够作为通用实验设计代理进行上下文实验设计，验证相关假设

Method: 使用开源和闭源指令调优的LLMs，在遗传扰动和分子属性发现任务上进行评估，并提出LLMNN混合方法

Result: LLM代理对实验反馈不敏感，传统方法（线性bandits和高斯过程优化）表现更好，LLMNN方法在不同领域都取得了竞争性或更优的性能

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在实践中无法进行上下文实验设计，需要将基于先验的推理与更新后验的批量获取解耦的混合框架

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose
agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context
experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and
closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and
molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no
sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly
permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical
methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently
outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided
Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with
nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves
competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring
significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and
closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based
reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新定义幻觉为损失最小化与人类可接受输出之间的结构性错配，揭示幻觉是校准错误导致的估计误差。

Method: 通过形式化定义幻觉，推导出一般数据分布下幻觉率的高概率下界，并在硬币聚合、开放式问答和文本到图像生成等任务上进行实验验证。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，即使是最优估计器也无法避免幻觉，幻觉是生成模型固有的结构性问题。

Conclusion: 幻觉不是简单的模型缺陷，而是损失函数优化与人类期望输出之间根本性不匹配的结果，需要重新思考生成模型的评估和优化方法。

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an
estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even
loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a
general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data
distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between
loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors
induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and
text-to-image support our theory.

Abstract: The main focus of research on Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is on model
developments with the aim of improving predictive accuracy. Most of these

that a larger predictive uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions.
We show that uncertainty in KT models is informative and that this signal would

TL;DR: 本文基于Kolmogorov复杂性理论，为Transformers神经网络引入了渐近最优描述长度目标的理论框架，证明其可实现最优压缩，并构建了可微分的变分目标，在算法任务中显示出良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDL原则在神经网络（特别是Transformers）中的应用面临挑战，因为缺乏对模型复杂度的原则性、通用度量方法。

Method: 基于Kolmogorov复杂性理论建立渐近最优描述长度目标，证明Transformers的计算普适性，并构建基于自适应高斯混合先验的可微分变分目标。

Result: 理论证明渐近最优目标存在，变分目标在算法任务中选择低复杂度解并具有强泛化能力，但标准优化器难以从随机初始化找到此类解。

Conclusion: 为识别具有强渐近保证的描述长度目标提供了理论框架，为实现更高压缩和泛化能力的神经网络训练指明了潜在路径。

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for
applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural
networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled,
universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical
notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an
objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive
constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that
asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new
demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such
objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a
variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our
empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a
low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but
standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,
highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a
theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong
asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural
networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

TL;DR: 提出IIET（迭代隐式欧拉Transformer）来解决高阶数值方法在Transformer中的性能-效率权衡问题，通过迭代隐式欧拉方法简化高阶方法，并引入IIAD蒸馏技术来平衡性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高阶数值方法虽然能提升Transformer在NLP和CV任务中的性能，但带来了计算开销增加的性能-效率权衡问题，且传统效率技术（如蒸馏）可能对这些模型性能产生负面影响。

Method: 提出IIET架构，使用迭代隐式欧拉方法简化高阶方法；引入IIAD（迭代影响感知蒸馏）技术，通过灵活阈值来平衡性能-效率权衡。

Result: 在lm-evaluation-harness上，IIET比普通Transformer平均准确率提升2.65%，比PCformer提升0.8%；高效变体E-IIET减少55%推理开销，同时保留99.4%原始任务准确率；最高效变体在可比速度下比普通Transformer性能提升超过1.6%。

Conclusion: IIET通过迭代隐式欧拉方法成功解决了高阶数值方法在Transformer中的性能-效率权衡问题，IIAD技术提供了灵活的性能-效率平衡机制，实现了显著的性能提升和效率优化。

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like
NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased
computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency
techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of
these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based
Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit
\textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies
high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This
simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates
model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we
introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD
allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On
lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla
Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET,
significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the
original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an
average performance gain exceeding 1.6\% over vanilla Transformer with
comparable speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多轮稀疏奖励环境中LLM智能体训练的根本挑战：探索-利用级联失败，包括早期策略过早收敛和晚期策略崩溃。

Method: 提出熵正则化策略优化(EPO)框架，包含三个协同机制：多轮环境中的熵正则化、熵平滑正则化器限制策略熵在历史平均值范围内、自适应阶段权重平衡训练中的探索与利用。

Result: EPO在ScienceWorld上实现高达152%的性能提升，在ALFWorld上实现19.8%的性能提升，分析证明EPO能保证熵方差单调递减同时保持收敛。

Conclusion: 多轮稀疏奖励环境需要与传统RL根本不同的熵控制方法，对LLM智能体训练具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where
completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode,
presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a
critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

Conclusion: SPEAR通过课程式自模仿学习有效解决了强化学习中的探索-利用权衡问题，为智能LLM代理的训练提供了稳定且高效的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic
tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,
yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but
such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to
the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive
exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own
experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway
divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)
recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a
replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy
update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range
of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum
to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster
skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.
At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the
accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar
distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As
training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing
successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level
exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.
To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in
the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such
as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and
advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb
over-confidence.

TL;DR: 本文提出ICL激活对齐(IA2)方法，通过自蒸馏技术让SFT模型复制ICL的激活模式，在SFT前进行IA2预训练可显著提升模型准确性和校准度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL在数据稀缺场景下比SFT具有更好的泛化性和校准响应，但推理计算成本更高。研究能否利用ICL的内部计算来改进SFT的质量。

Method: 提出ICL激活对齐(IA2)自蒸馏技术，通过让SFT模型复制ICL的激活模式来激励ICL式的内部推理。在SFT前进行IA2作为预训练步骤。

Result: 在12个流行基准测试和2个模型家族上的广泛实证结果显示，IA2显著提高了模型输出的准确性和校准度。

Conclusion: IA2不仅具有实际应用价值，还为理解模型适应的内部机制提供了概念窗口，表明ICL和SFT通过不同的功能机制实现适应。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training
weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast,
In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or
demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more
calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of
more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal
computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL
and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods
achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this
observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation
Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's
activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.
Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy
and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results
on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only
practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner
mechanics of model adaptation.
