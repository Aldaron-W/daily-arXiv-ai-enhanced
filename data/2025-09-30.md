### [1] [Are you sure? Measuring models bias in content moderation through uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22699)
*Alessandra Urbinati,Mirko Lai,Simona Frenda,Marco Antonio Stranisci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于不确定性的无监督方法来评估内容审核模型的公平性，使用保形预测技术分析模型对弱势群体标注的不确定性，发现某些预训练模型对少数群体标注预测准确但置信度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在内容审核中存在种族和社会偏见问题，现有基于性能的指标难以有效衡量模型公平性，需要开发新的评估方法。

Method: 使用保形预测技术计算模型不确定性，作为评估11个模型对女性和非白人标注者偏见的代理指标，并与F1分数等性能指标进行比较。

Result: 结果显示某些预训练模型对少数群体标注预测准确率高但置信度低，通过测量模型置信度可以识别哪些标注群体在预训练模型中代表性更好。

Conclusion: 基于不确定性的方法能够揭示预训练模型中的群体代表性差异，为模型去偏过程提供指导，确保在有效使用前进行去偏处理。

Abstract: Automatic content moderation is crucial to ensuring safety in social media.
Language Model-based classifiers are being increasingly adopted for this task,
but it has been shown that they perpetuate racial and social biases. Even if
several resources and benchmark corpora have been developed to challenge this
issue, measuring the fairness of models in content moderation remains an open
issue. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach that benchmarks models
on the basis of their uncertainty in classifying messages annotated by people
belonging to vulnerable groups. We use uncertainty, computed by means of the
conformal prediction technique, as a proxy to analyze the bias of 11 models
against women and non-white annotators and observe to what extent it diverges
from metrics based on performance, such as the $F_1$ score. The results show
that some pre-trained models predict with high accuracy the labels coming from
minority groups, even if the confidence in their prediction is low. Therefore,
by measuring the confidence of models, we are able to see which groups of
annotators are better represented in pre-trained models and lead the debiasing
process of these models before their effective use.

### [2] [AccessEval: Benchmarking Disability Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22703)
*Srikant Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AccessEval基准评估了21个闭源和开源LLM在6个现实世界领域和9种残疾类型下的表现，发现对残疾相关查询的响应比中性查询更负面、刻板印象更强、事实错误更多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统研究LLM在不同残疾情境下处理现实生活查询时表现出的差异，揭示模型行为中存在的持续能力主义偏见。

Method: 使用配对的Neutral和Disability-Aware查询，在6个现实领域和9种残疾类型上评估21个LLM，通过情感、社会认知和事实准确性指标分析模型输出。

Result: 对残疾相关查询的响应语调更负面、刻板印象增加、事实错误率更高，这些影响因领域和残疾类型而异，听力、言语和行动障碍用户受到不成比例的影响。

Conclusion: 这些差异反映了模型行为中嵌入的持续能力主义，强调了在日常生活应用中减少偏见的重要性，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains
but often exhibit disparities in how they handle real-life queries. To
systematically investigate these effects within various disability contexts, we
introduce \textbf{AccessEval (Accessibility Evaluation)}, a benchmark
evaluating 21 closed- and open-source LLMs across 6 real-world domains and 9
disability types using paired Neutral and Disability-Aware Queries. We
evaluated model outputs with metrics for sentiment, social perception, and
factual accuracy.
  Our analysis reveals that responses to disability-aware queries tend to have
a more negative tone, increased stereotyping, and higher factual error compared
to neutral queries. These effects show notable variation by domain and
disability type, with disabilities affecting hearing, speech, and mobility
disproportionately impacted. These disparities reflect persistent forms of
ableism embedded in model behavior.
  By examining model performance in real-world decision-making contexts, we
better illuminate how such biases can translate into tangible harms for
disabled users. This framing helps bridges the gap between technical evaluation
and user impact, reinforcing importance of bias mitigation in day-to-day
applications. Our dataset is publicly available at:

### [3] [RAR$^2$: Retrieval-Augmented Medical Reasoning via Thought-Driven Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22713)
*Kaishuai Xu,Wenjun Hou,Yi Cheng,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAR²是一个联合学习框架，通过构建思维过程来揭示隐含知识需求，指导检索和答案生成，在生物医学问答任务中优于现有RAG方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理需要深度推理的复杂医学问题时存在局限，表面级输入无法反映任务真实知识需求，且缺乏对推理过程的显式建模。

Method: 提出RAR²框架，联合优化推理增强检索和检索增强推理，构建思维过程揭示知识需求，使用混合偏好对数据集和DPO训练，并设计了两种测试时扩展策略。

Result: 在多个生物医学问答数据集上的实验表明，RAR²优于有或无微调的RAG基线方法。

Conclusion: RAR²通过显式建模推理过程有效解决了复杂医学问题中的知识需求识别和整合问题，展示了在临床任务支持中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on diverse
medical benchmarks, highlighting their potential in supporting real-world
clinical tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key
approach for mitigating knowledge gaps and hallucinations by incorporating
external medical information. However, RAG still struggles with complex medical
questions that require intensive reasoning, as surface-level input often fails
to reflect the true knowledge needs of the task. Existing methods typically
focus on refining queries without explicitly modeling the reasoning process,
limiting their ability to retrieve and integrate clinically relevant knowledge.
In this work, we propose RAR$^2$, a joint learning framework that improves both
Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning. RAR$^2$
constructs a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements and
uses it to guide retrieval and answer generation. We build a training dataset
of mixed preference pairs and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to
train the model. Moreover, we design two test-time scaling strategies to
explore the boundaries of our framework. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAR$^2$ across several biomedical question answering datasets,
outperforming RAG baselines with or without fine-tuning.

### [4] [TRUEBench: Can LLM Response Meet Real-world Constraints as Productivity Assistant?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22715)
*Jiho Park,Jongyoon Song,Minjin Choi,Kyuho Heo,Taehun Huh,Ji Won Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRUEBench是一个专门为LLM生产力助手设计的新基准测试，解决了现有基准在多样性、隐式约束和多轮对话方面的不足，通过12种语言、严格评估标准和复杂对话场景提供更真实的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLM真实世界指令跟随能力方面存在不足：缺乏多语言性、未能捕捉用户请求中的隐式约束、忽视多轮对话的复杂性。

Method: 引入TRUEBench基准，特点包括：12种语言的输入提示、实例内多语言指令、严格评估标准捕获显式和隐式约束、包含累积约束和上下文切换的复杂多轮对话场景，并使用LLM验证器精炼约束。

Result: 实验表明TRUEBench比现有基准更具挑战性，即使是像OpenAI o1这样的强大模型也仅达到69.07%的整体通过率。

Conclusion: TRUEBench为LLM在实际生产力场景中提供了严格而真实的评估，突显了它们的能力和局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral as productivity
assistants, but existing benchmarks fall short in rigorously evaluating their
real-world instruction-following capabilities. Current benchmarks often (i)
lack sufficient multilinguality, (ii) fail to capture the implicit constraints
inherent in user requests, and (iii) overlook the complexities of multi-turn
dialogue. To address these critical gaps and provide a more realistic
assessment, we introduce TRUEBench (Trustworthy Real-world Usage Evaluation
Benchmark)1, a novel benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based productivity
assistants. TRUEBench distinguishes itself by featuring input prompts across 12
languages, incorporating intra-instance multilingual instructions, employing
rigorous evaluation criteria to capture both explicit and implicit constraints,
and including complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios with both accumulating
constraints and context switches. Furthermore, to ensure reliability in
evaluation, we refined constraints using an LLM validator. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TRUEBench presents significantly greater
challenges than existing benchmarks; for instance, a strong model like OpenAI
o1 achieved only a 69.07% overall pass rate. TRUEBench offers a demanding and
realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, highlighting
their capabilities and limitations.

### [5] [Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis with Dynamic Attention Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22729)
*Sadia Abdulhalim,Muaz Albaghdadi,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Dynamic Attention Fusion (DAF)框架，通过自适应注意力机制融合文本和声学特征，无需微调预训练编码器，在多模态情感分析任务中显著优于静态融合和单模态基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感分析仅依赖文本，忽略了语调等非语言线索对情感意图理解的重要性，需要更有效的多模态融合方法。

Method: 使用冻结的预训练语言模型文本嵌入和语音编码器的声学特征，通过自适应注意力机制为每个话语动态加权不同模态。

Result: 在大型多模态基准测试中，DAF模型在F1分数上取得显著提升，预测误差降低，动态加权策略对建模复杂情感输入至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过有效整合语言和非语言信息，该方法为情感预测提供了更鲁棒的基础，对情感计算应用具有广泛影响。

Abstract: Traditional sentiment analysis has long been a unimodal task, relying solely
on text. This approach overlooks non-verbal cues such as vocal tone and prosody
that are essential for capturing true emotional intent. We introduce Dynamic
Attention Fusion (DAF), a lightweight framework that combines frozen text
embeddings from a pretrained language model with acoustic features from a
speech encoder, using an adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality
per utterance. Without any finetuning of the underlying encoders, our proposed
DAF model consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on
a large multimodal benchmark. We report notable gains in F1-score and
reductions in prediction error and perform a variety of ablation studies that
support our hypothesis that the dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for
modeling emotionally complex inputs. By effectively integrating verbal and
non-verbal information, our approach offers a more robust foundation for
sentiment prediction and carries broader impact for affective computing
applications -- from emotion recognition and mental health assessment to more
natural human computer interaction.

### [6] [Enabling Approximate Joint Sampling in Diffusion LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22738)
*Parikshit Bansal,Sujay Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种在扩散语言模型中近似联合采样的方法，通过轻量级采样器层在单次前向传播中生成多个token，平衡生成质量与速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型逐个生成token保证联合分布正确性，而扩散模型并行生成多个token会偏离真实联合分布，导致准确性下降但速度提升。需要找到平衡质量与速度的近似联合采样方法。

Method: 在现有大型扩散LM上添加轻量级单层采样器，一次完整模型前向传播后，仅对该采样器层进行多次前向传播来生成多个unmasked token。采样器训练模仿完整模型的精确联合采样。

Result: 在预训练和指令调优模型的语言建模及数学编程任务中，当每个去噪步骤生成4个token时，MAUVE分数达到0.87（对比边际基线0.31），接近真实联合分布。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了扩散语言模型中的近似联合采样，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升生成速度。

Abstract: In autoregressive language models, each token is sampled by conditioning on
all the past tokens; the overall string has thus been sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution represented by the model. In contrast, masked
diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and
potentially in parallel. Generating an overall string sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution would (again) require exactly one token unmasking
in every full-model forward pass. The more tokens unmasked in parallel, the
further away the string is from the true joint; this can be seen in the
resulting drop in accuracy (but, increase in speed). In this paper we devise a
way to {\em approximately} sample multiple tokens from the joint distribution
in a single full-model forward pass; we do so by developing a new lightweight
single-layer ``sampler" on top of an existing large diffusion LM. One forward
pass of the full model can now be followed by multiple forward passes of only
this sampler layer, to yield multiple unmasked tokens. Our sampler is trained
to mimic exact joint sampling from the (frozen) full model. We show the
effectiveness of our approximate joint sampling for both pretrained-only
(Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language
modeling and math \& coding tasks. When four tokens are unmasked for each
full-model denoising step, our sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of
0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to the true joint
distribution.

### [7] [Painless Activation Steering: An Automated, Lightweight Approach for Post-Training Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22739)
*Sasha Cui,Zhongren Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Painless Activation Steering (PAS)，一种完全自动化的激活引导方法，无需手动构建提示对或特征标注，可在任何标注数据集上使用，为语言模型提供快速、轻量级的后训练选项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法需要手动构建提示对或特征标注，使用不便；而权重微调耗时昂贵，提示工程难以精确控制。需要一种即插即用的自动化激活引导方法。

Method: PAS方法家族，包括内省变体(iPAS)，通过自动化方式从标注数据集中构建激活向量，无需人工干预。

Result: 在3个开源模型和18个任务上的评估显示，PAS能可靠提升行为任务性能（偏见、道德、对齐任务分别提升10.1%、5.2%、34.8%），但对智能导向任务无效。PAS还能在上下文学习和监督微调基础上提供额外增益。

Conclusion: PAS提供了一种实用、自动化的语言模型后训练选项，构建了可廉价训练、轻松存储和按需激活的快速轻量级激活向量，明确了激活引导的有效应用场景和局限性。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and
behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is
time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and
often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises
a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training
methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or
labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the
plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of
fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled
dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human
intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models
(Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks;
we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for
intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the
strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8%
on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context
Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector
that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results
provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy
it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.

### [8] [MIRAGE: Multi-hop Reasoning with Ambiguity Evaluation for Illusory Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22750)
*Jeonghyun Park,Ingeol Baek,Seunghyun Yoon,Haeun Jang,Aparna Garimella,Akriti Jain,Nedim Lipka,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MIRAGE基准来评估多跳推理中的歧义处理，并开发了CLARION多智能体框架来解决这一挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多跳问答常常涉及与推理过程不可分割的歧义性，这给当前大语言模型带来了挑战

Method: 创建MIRAGE基准包含1,142个歧义多跳问题，并提出CLARION多智能体框架来处理歧义推理

Result: 实验表明即使最先进的模型在MIRAGE上也表现不佳，而CLARION框架显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 歧义解析与多步推理的结合是一个独特且重要的挑战，CLARION为开发更自适应和鲁棒的推理系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Real-world Multi-hop Question Answering (QA) often involves ambiguity that is
inseparable from the reasoning process itself. This ambiguity creates a
distinct challenge, where multiple reasoning paths emerge from a single
question, each requiring independent resolution. Since each sub-question is
ambiguous, the model must resolve ambiguity at every step. Thus, answering a
single question requires handling multiple layers of ambiguity throughout the
reasoning chain. We find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle in
this setting, typically exploring wrong reasoning paths and producing
incomplete answers. To facilitate research on multi-hop ambiguity, we introduce
MultI-hop Reasoning with AmbiGuity Evaluation for Illusory Questions (MIRAGE),
a benchmark designed to analyze and evaluate this challenging intersection of
ambiguity interpretation and multi-hop reasoning. MIRAGE contains 1,142
high-quality examples of ambiguous multi-hop questions, categorized under a
taxonomy of syntactic, general, and semantic ambiguity, and curated through a
rigorous multi-LLM verification pipeline. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art models struggle on MIRAGE, confirming that resolving ambiguity
combined with multi-step inference is a distinct and significant challenge. To
establish a robust baseline, we propose CLarifying Ambiguity with a Reasoning
and InstructiON (CLARION), a multi-agent framework that significantly
outperforms existing approaches on MIRAGE, paving the way for more adaptive and
robust reasoning systems.

### [9] [ML2B: Multi-Lingual ML Benchmark For AutoML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22768)
*Ekaterina Trofimova,Zosia Shamina,Maria Selifanova,Artem Zaitsev,Remi Savchuk,Maxim Minets,Daria Ozerova,Emil Sataev,Denis Zuenko,Andrey E. Ustyuzhanin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ML2B是首个评估多语言机器学习代码生成的基准测试，包含30个Kaggle竞赛任务翻译成13种语言，结果显示非英语任务性能下降15-45%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习代码生成基准主要局限于英语，忽视了机器学习研究和实践的全球性和多语言特性。

Method: 构建ML2B基准，包含30个Kaggle竞赛任务翻译成13种自然语言，涵盖表格、文本和图像数据类型，使用AIDE自动化框架进行端到端评估。

Result: 结果显示在非英语任务上存在显著的15-45%性能下降，揭示了多语言表示学习在代码生成中的关键挑战。

Conclusion: ML2B基准、评估框架和全面结果已通过GitHub仓库公开，以促进多语言机器学习代码生成的未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
in generating machine learning (ML) code, enabling end-to-end pipeline
construction from natural language instructions. However, existing benchmarks
for ML code generation are mainly restricted to English, overlooking the global
and multilingual nature of ML research and practice. To address this gap, we
present ML2B, the first benchmark for evaluating multilingual ML code
generation. ML2B consists of 30 Kaggle competitions translated into 13 natural
languages, covering tabular, text, and image data types, with structured
metadata and validated human-reviewed translations. For evaluation, we employ
AIDE, an automated framework for end-to-end assessment of data science
pipelines, and provide insights into cross-lingual model performance. Our
results reveal substantial 15-45% performance degradation on non-English tasks,
highlighting critical challenges in multilingual representation learning for
code generation. The benchmark, evaluation framework, and comprehensive results
are made available through our GitHub repository to facilitate future research
in multilingual ML code generation: https://github.com/enaix/ml2b.

### [10] [ArFake: A Multi-Dialect Benchmark and Baselines for Arabic Spoof-Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22808)
*Mohamed Maged,Alhassan Ehab,Ali Mekky,Besher Hassan,Shady Shehata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文构建了首个多方言阿拉伯语伪造语音数据集，通过评估多种TTS模型发现FishSpeech在阿拉伯语语音克隆方面表现最佳，但仅依赖单一TTS模型可能限制泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式文本转语音模型的发展，区分真实和合成语音变得困难，特别是对于研究较少的阿拉伯语及其多种方言。大多数伪造检测研究集中在英语上，阿拉伯语存在显著研究空白。

Method: 构建多方言阿拉伯语伪造语音数据集，通过评估流水线比较多种TTS模型：使用嵌入方法和分类器头训练分类器；在MFCC特征上应用经典机器学习算法；使用RawNet2架构；计算基于人类评分的平均意见分数；通过自动语音识别模型处理原始和合成数据集以测量词错误率。

Result: FishSpeech在Casablanca语料库的阿拉伯语语音克隆中优于其他TTS模型，产生更真实和具有挑战性的合成语音样本。

Conclusion: FishSpeech在阿拉伯语语音克隆方面表现最佳，但仅依赖单一TTS模型进行数据集构建可能限制泛化能力，建议考虑合并多个模型的音频或选择最佳性能模型。

Abstract: With the rise of generative text-to-speech models, distinguishing between
real and synthetic speech has become challenging, especially for Arabic that
have received limited research attention. Most spoof detection efforts have
focused on English, leaving a significant gap for Arabic and its many dialects.
In this work, we introduce the first multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech
dataset. To evaluate the difficulty of the synthesized audio from each model
and determine which produces the most challenging samples, we aimed to guide
the construction of our final dataset either by merging audios from multiple
models or by selecting the best-performing model, we conducted an evaluation
pipeline that included training classifiers using two approaches: modern
embedding-based methods combined with classifier heads; classical machine
learning algorithms applied to MFCC features; and the RawNet2 architecture. The
pipeline further incorporated the calculation of Mean Opinion Score based on
human ratings, as well as processing both original and synthesized datasets
through an Automatic Speech Recognition model to measure the Word Error Rate.
Our results demonstrate that FishSpeech outperforms other TTS models in Arabic
voice cloning on the Casablanca corpus, producing more realistic and
challenging synthetic speech samples. However, relying on a single TTS for
dataset creation may limit generalizability.

### [11] [EditGRPO: Reinforcement Learning with Post -Rollout Edits for Clinically Accurate Chest X-Ray Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22812)
*Kai Zhang,Christopher Malon,Lichao Sun,Martin Renqiang Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EditGRPO是一种混合策略强化学习算法，通过临床动机奖励优化放射学报告生成，解决了传统监督微调与临床效果不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在放射学报告生成中，其监督微调目标与临床效果不一致，需要更有效的优化方法。

Method: 提出EditGRPO混合策略强化学习算法，结合在线策略探索和离线策略指导，在训练过程中注入句子级详细修正。

Result: 在四个主要胸部X光报告生成数据集上，EditGRPO相比SFT和普通GRPO基线平均提升3.4%的性能指标，在未见数据集上平均提升5.9%。

Conclusion: EditGRPO通过混合策略强化学习有效提升了放射学报告生成的临床效果和泛化能力。

Abstract: Radiology report generation requires advanced medical image analysis,
effective temporal reasoning, and accurate text generation. Although recent
innovations, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), have shown
improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not
explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO,
a mixed-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed specifically to
optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO
integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting
sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy
approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues
typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM initialized with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO
baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4% in CheXbert, GREEN,
Radgraph, and RATEScore metrics across four major chest X-ray report generation
datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain
generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9% on unseen datasets.

### [12] [Critique-Coder: Enhancing Coder Models by Critique Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22824)
*Chi Ruan,Dongfu Jiang,Yubo Wang,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了批判强化学习(CRL)方法，通过让模型对(问题，解决方案)对生成批判来增强推理能力，结合标准RL训练Critique-Coder模型，在代码生成和逻辑推理任务上表现优于纯RL模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习主要关注生成响应，缺乏明确培养批判或反思的机制。受CFT和CGD等研究启发，希望通过显式教授LLMs如何批判来提升推理能力。

Method: 提出CRL方法，模型为给定(问题，解决方案)对生成批判，奖励仅基于批判的最终判断标签是否与真实标签一致。在此基础上开发Critique-Coder，在标准RL数据中替换20%为CRL数据进行混合训练。

Result: Critique-Coder在所有评估基准上持续优于纯RL基线。Critique-Coder-8B在LiveCodeBench(v5)上达到60%以上，优于DeepCoder-14B和GPT-o1。在BBEH数据集的逻辑推理任务上也表现更好，显示CRL在编码数据集上的应用能增强通用推理能力。

Conclusion: CRL作为标准RL的补充，能有效增强LLM的推理能力，且这种能力可迁移到广泛任务中。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a popular training paradigm,
particularly when paired with reasoning models. While effective, it primarily
focuses on generating responses and lacks mechanisms to explicitly foster
critique or reflection. Several recent studies, like Critique-Fine-Tuning (CFT)
and Critique-Guided-Distillation (CGD) have shown the benefits of explicitly
teaching LLMs how to critique. Motivated by them, we propose Critique
Reinforcement Learning (CRL), where the model is tasked with generating a
critique for a given (question, solution) pair. The reward is determined solely
by whether the final judgment label $c \in \{\texttt{True}, \texttt{False}\}$
of the generated critique aligns with the ground-truth judgment $c^*$. Building
on this point, we introduce \textsc{Critique-Coder}, which is trained on a
hybrid of RL and CRL by substituting 20\% of the standard RL data with CRL
data. We fine-tune multiple models (\textsc{Critique-Coder}) and evaluate them
on different benchmarks to show their advantages over RL-only models. We show
that \textsc{Critique-Coder} consistently outperforms RL-only baselines on all
the evaluated benchmarks. Notably, our \textsc{Critique-Coder-8B} can reach
over 60\% on LiveCodeBench (v5), outperforming other reasoning models like
DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Beyond code generation, \textsc{Critique-Coder} also
demonstrates enhanced general reasoning abilities, as evidenced by its better
performance on logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset. This indicates that
the application of CRL on coding datasets enhances general reasoning and
critique abilities, which are transferable across a broad range of tasks.
Hence, we believe that CRL works as a great complement to standard RL for LLM
reasoning.

### [13] [ChatInject: Abusing Chat Templates for Prompt Injection in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22830)
*Hwan Chang,Yonghyun Jun,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatInject是一种新型的间接提示注入攻击，通过模仿聊天模板格式和多轮对话来说服LLM代理执行恶意指令，攻击成功率显著高于传统方法，现有防御措施对其无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于LLM的代理与外部环境交互增多，出现了新的攻击面。传统研究主要关注纯文本注入攻击，但LLM对结构化聊天模板的依赖及其在上下文操纵中的脆弱性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出ChatInject攻击，将恶意负载格式化为原生聊天模板样式，并开发多轮对话变体，通过多轮对话说服代理接受可疑操作。

Result: 在多个前沿LLM上的实验显示：(1)ChatInject攻击成功率显著提升，多轮对话在InjecAgent上达到52.33%成功率；(2)基于聊天模板的负载具有强跨模型迁移性；(3)现有提示防御措施基本无效。

Conclusion: 当前代理系统存在严重漏洞，ChatInject攻击暴露了LLM在结构化模板和多轮对话情境下的安全脆弱性。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language model (LLM) based agents that
interact with external environments has created new attack surfaces for
adversarial manipulation. One major threat is indirect prompt injection, where
attackers embed malicious instructions in external environment output, causing
agents to interpret and execute them as if they were legitimate prompts. While
previous research has focused primarily on plain-text injection attacks, we
find a significant yet underexplored vulnerability: LLMs' dependence on
structured chat templates and their susceptibility to contextual manipulation
through persuasive multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we introduce ChatInject,
an attack that formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates,
thereby exploiting the model's inherent instruction-following tendencies.
Building on this foundation, we develop a persuasion-driven Multi-turn variant
that primes the agent across conversational turns to accept and execute
otherwise suspicious actions. Through comprehensive experiments across frontier
LLMs, we demonstrate three critical findings: (1) ChatInject achieves
significantly higher average attack success rates than traditional prompt
injection methods, improving from 5.18% to 32.05% on AgentDojo and from 15.13%
to 45.90% on InjecAgent, with multi-turn dialogues showing particularly strong
performance at average 52.33% success rate on InjecAgent, (2)
chat-template-based payloads demonstrate strong transferability across models
and remain effective even against closed-source LLMs, despite their unknown
template structures, and (3) existing prompt-based defenses are largely
ineffective against this attack approach, especially against Multi-turn
variants. These findings highlight vulnerabilities in current agent systems.

*Kai Hua,Zhiyuan Feng,Chongyang Tao,Rui Yan,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RSM-DCK模型，通过检测上下文和知识库中的相关部分来改进多轮对话响应选择，避免无用信息干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索式对话系统将所有上下文和知识内容用于匹配响应候选，但其中许多无用信息（如话题转移）会影响匹配过程，导致性能下降。

Method: 使用最近上下文作为查询，在词级和话语级语义上预选相关上下文和知识部分；让响应候选分别与选中的上下文和知识交互；最后利用上下文与响应候选的融合表示更自信地后选相关知识部分进行匹配。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上测试，模型性能优于现有方法，能有效检测相关上下文和知识进行响应选择。

Conclusion: RSM-DCK模型通过检测上下文和知识的相关部分，显著提升了多轮对话响应选择的性能。

Abstract: Recently, knowledge-grounded conversations in the open domain gain great
attention from researchers. Existing works on retrieval-based dialogue systems
have paid tremendous efforts to utilize neural networks to build a matching
model, where all of the context and knowledge contents are used to match the
response candidate with various representation methods. Actually, different
parts of the context and knowledge are differentially important for recognizing
the proper response candidate, as many utterances are useless due to the topic
shift. Those excessive useless information in the context and knowledge can
influence the matching process and leads to inferior performance. To address
this problem, we propose a multi-turn \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{S}election
\textbf{M}odel that can \textbf{D}etect the relevant parts of the
\textbf{C}ontext and \textbf{K}nowledge collection (\textbf{RSM-DCK}). Our
model first uses the recent context as a query to pre-select relevant parts of
the context and knowledge collection at the word-level and utterance-level
semantics. Further, the response candidate interacts with the selected context
and knowledge collection respectively. In the end, The fused representation of
the context and response candidate is utilized to post-select the relevant
parts of the knowledge collection more confidently for matching. We test our
proposed model on two benchmark datasets. Evaluation results indicate that our
model achieves better performance than the existing methods, and can
effectively detect the relevant context and knowledge for response selection.

TL;DR: 提出了In-Context Routing (ICR)方法，通过在注意力对数层面内化可泛化的ICL模式，实现零样本成本下的少样本性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式上下文学习方法主要依赖注入偏移向量，未能充分利用ICL的结构机制且泛化能力有限

Method: ICR提取ICL过程中出现的可重用结构方向，使用可学习的输入条件路由器来调节注意力对数，实现一次训练多次使用的框架

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集上的评估显示，ICR持续优于需要任务特定检索或训练的先前方法，并在现有方法难以处理的域外任务上表现出强大泛化能力

Conclusion: ICR有望推动ICL实用价值的边界

Abstract: Implicit in-context learning (ICL) has newly emerged as a promising paradigm
that simulates ICL behaviors in the representation space of Large Language
Models (LLMs), aiming to attain few-shot performance at zero-shot cost.
However, existing approaches largely rely on injecting shift vectors into
residual flows, which are typically constructed from labeled demonstrations or
task-specific alignment. Such designs fall short of utilizing the structural
mechanisms underlying ICL and suffer from limited generalizability. To address
this, we propose In-Context Routing (ICR), a novel implicit ICL method that
internalizes generalizable ICL patterns at the attention logits level. It
extracts reusable structural directions that emerge during ICL and employs a
learnable input-conditioned router to modulate attention logits accordingly,
enabling a train-once-and-reuse framework. We evaluate ICR on 12 real-world
datasets spanning diverse domains and multiple LLMs. The results show that ICR
consistently outperforms prior implicit ICL methods that require task-specific
retrieval or training, while demonstrating robust generalization to
out-of-domain tasks where existing methods struggle. These findings position
ICR to push the boundary of ICL's practical value.

TL;DR: 该论文对45个大语言模型进行了大规模认知偏见评估，分析了280万条响应，发现LLMs在17.8-57.3%的情况下表现出与人类相似的认知偏见行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地嵌入现实世界决策过程，需要评估它们是否表现出人类常见的认知偏见，这对确保AI决策的可靠性至关重要。

Method: 提出了基于多选题任务的新评估框架，与心理学家合作手工策划了220个决策场景数据集，通过受控提示变体生成多样化提示。

Result: LLMs在锚定、可得性、确认、框架、解释、过度归因、前景理论和代表性等八种偏见中表现出偏见一致性行为。模型大小和提示特异性显著影响偏见易感性：更大模型（>32B参数）在39.5%情况下减少偏见，更详细提示使大多数偏见减少达14.9%。

Conclusion: 大语言模型确实表现出系统性的认知偏见，但通过增加模型规模和优化提示设计可以在一定程度上缓解这些偏见。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in real-world
decision-making processes, it becomes crucial to examine the extent to which
they exhibit cognitive biases. Extensively studied in the field of psychology,
cognitive biases appear as systematic distortions commonly observed in human
judgments. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight
well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million
LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. To achieve this,
we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks,
hand-curate a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive
biases in collaboration with psychologists, and propose a scalable approach for
generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates. Our analysis
shows that LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances
across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring,
availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect
theory, and representativeness biases. We find that both model size and prompt
specificity play a significant role on bias susceptibility as follows: larger
size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt
detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case
(Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络和transformer的混合方法，结合词典特征来预测阿拉伯语文档可读性，在文档级别融合两种方法的预测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够准确预测阿拉伯语文档可读性的系统，作为BAREC共享任务2025约束赛道的一部分。

Method: 将文档建模为句子级图，节点包含句子和词元，边捕获词汇共现和类别关系等语言关系。使用SAMER词典特征和阿拉伯语transformer的上下文嵌入来丰富句子节点。GNN和transformer作为两个独立分支训练，在推理时通过后期融合结合预测结果。

Result: 实验结果表明，这种混合方法在多个可读性指标上优于单独的GNN或transformer分支。

Conclusion: 融合方法在文档级别具有优势，但仅使用GNN的方法在句子级可读性精确预测方面表现更强。

Abstract: We present a graph-based approach enriched with lexicons to predict
document-level readability in Arabic, developed as part of the Constrained
Track of the BAREC Shared Task 2025. Our system models each document as a
sentence-level graph, where nodes represent sentences and lemmas, and edges
capture linguistic relationships such as lexical co-occurrence and class
membership. Sentence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as
well as contextual embeddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph
neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained as two
independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at
inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level outputs are aggregated
using max pooling to reflect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results
show that this hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches
across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that
fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only approach
remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.

TL;DR: HEART是一个利用情感反馈进行迭代自我修正的新框架，通过基于六种基本情感的情感化提示来改进语言模型的推理能力，在验证器指导下能显著提升推理深度和准确率，但在无验证器设置中效果不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受心理学研究启发，当前的自反思策略主要关注逻辑或结构优化，未能利用情感反馈的指导潜力。研究表明情绪可以调节认知表现，因此希望通过情感驱动的迭代修正来提升语言模型的复杂推理能力。

Method: HEART框架使用基于Paul Ekman六种基本情感的情感化短语对模型错误回答提供反馈，通过系统变化迭代中的情感语调来引导模型逃离错误推理路径，探索更有希望的替代方案。

Result: 在OlympiadBench、Humanity's Last Exam和SimpleQA等挑战性推理基准测试中，当有oracle验证器指导时，情感迭代协议能解锁显著更深的推理，准确率相比最先进基线有持续大幅提升。但在无验证器设置中难以稳定利用这些收益。

Conclusion: 机器推理的下一个前沿可能不仅在于精炼逻辑，还在于理解和利用模型的'内心'（HEART），但无验证器设置下的性能不稳定是实际部署的关键瓶颈和未来工作的主要挑战。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has shown considerable success in improving the performance
of language models on complex reasoning tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, current strategies such as self-reflection primarily focus on logical
or structural refinement. They do not leverage the guiding potential of
affective feedback. Inspired by psychological research showing that emotions
can modulate cognitive performance, we introduce HEART--a novel framework that
uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction. HEART provides
feedback on a model's incorrect response using a curated set of concise,
emotionally charged phrases based on the six universal emotions categorized by
Dr. Paul Ekman. By systematically varying the emotional tone of the feedback
across iterations, our method guides the model to escape flawed reasoning paths
and explore more promising alternatives. We evaluate our framework on
challenging reasoning benchmarks including OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam,
and SimpleQA. Our results reveal a significant new phenomenon: when guided by
an oracle verifier, this affective iteration protocol unlocks significantly
deeper reasoning, leading to consistent and substantial increases in accuracy
over state-of-the-art baselines with the same verifier. However, we also
identify a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. In a verifier-free
setting, it struggles to harness these gains consistently, highlighting as a
key challenge for future work. Our findings suggest that the next frontier in
machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding
and leveraging the `HEART' of the models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前聊天机器人和基于LLM的社交智能体通常不整合心理理论(ToM)，而ToM是人类社交智能的关键方面。作者希望通过显式使用ToM来提升LLM的对话表现。

Method: 首先验证简单提示模型在对话回合间生成心理状态的有效性，然后引入ToMAgent，通过将ToM与对话前瞻相结合，产生对实现对话目标最有用的心理状态。

Result: 在Sotopia交互式社交评估基准上的实验表明，该方法优于一系列基线模型。ToMA表现出更具战略性、目标导向的推理行为，能够进行长时程适应，同时与对话伙伴保持更好的关系。

Conclusion: 该研究在整合心理理论构建社交智能LLM智能体方面迈出了重要一步，证明了显式使用ToM可以显著提升对话智能体的表现。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM)-an understanding of the mental states of others-is a key
aspect of human social intelligence, yet, chatbots and LLM-based social agents
do not typically integrate it. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs that
explicitly use ToM get better at dialogue, achieving goals more effectively.
After showing that simply prompting models to generate mental states between
dialogue turns already provides significant benefit, we further introduce
ToMAgent (ToMA), a ToM-focused dialogue agent. ToMA is trained by pairing ToM
with dialogue lookahead to produce mental states that are maximally useful for
achieving dialogue goals. Experiments on the Sotopia interactive social
evaluation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over a range
of baselines. Comprehensive analysis shows that ToMA exhibits more strategic,
goal-oriented reasoning behaviors, which enable long-horizon adaptation, while
maintaining better relationships with their partners. Our results suggest a
step forward in integrating ToM for building socially intelligent LLM agents.

Result: 在1000个文档提取任务基准测试中，平均奖励达0.573，优于GPT-4.1(0.457)、o3(0.464)和GPT-4.1-2025(0.459)。

Conclusion: 任务特定优化能够产生超越通用系统的模型，同时大幅减少计算资源需求。

Abstract: This paper presents Extract-0, a 7-billion parameter language model
specifically optimized for document information extraction that achieves
performance exceeding models with parameter counts several orders of magnitude
larger. Through a novel combination of synthetic data generation, supervised
fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and reinforcement learning via
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Extract-0 achieves a mean reward of
0.573 on a benchmark of 1,000 diverse document extraction tasks, outperforming
GPT-4.1 (0.457), o3 (0.464), and GPT-4.1-2025 (0.459). The training methodology
employs a memory-preserving synthetic data generation pipeline that produces
280,128 training examples from diverse document sources, followed by
parameterefficient fine-tuning that modifies only 0.53% of model weights (40.4M
out of 7.66B parameters). The reinforcement learning phase introduces a novel
semantic similarity-based reward function that handles the inherent ambiguity
in information extraction tasks. This research demonstrates that task-specific
optimization can yield models that surpass general-purpose systems while
requiring substantially fewer computational resource.

TL;DR: GPT-4o在药物相关医疗任务中表现不佳：药物剂型匹配错误率高，药物相互作用识别不一致，药物订单句子准备存在错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-4o在推荐适当药物方案方面的能力，测试其在药物相关医疗任务中的一致性。

Method: 使用GPT-4o完成三个实验：药物名称与剂型匹配、药物相互作用识别（使用内部知识和网络搜索）、药物订单句子准备。通过余弦相似度、Levenshtein相似度、ROUGE指标和临床医生手动评估来量化准确性。

Result: GPT-4o在药物剂型匹配中表现差（仅49%正确），药物相互作用识别不一致（网络搜索54.7% vs 内部知识69.2%），药物订单句子准备仅65.8%无错误。

Conclusion: 模型在所有测试中表现总体较差，需要领域特定的临床医生标注数据集训练和全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) can be useful in diagnosing medical
conditions, but few studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending
appropriate medication regimens. The purpose of this evaluation was to test
GPT-4o on three medication benchmarking tests including mapping a drug name to
its correct formulation, identifying drug-drug interactions using both its
internal knowledge and using a web search, and preparing a medication order
sentence after being given the medication name. Methods: Using GTP-4o three
experiments were completed. Accuracy was quantified by computing cosine
similarity on TF-IDF vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and
ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1 between each response and its reference string or by manual
evaluation by clinicians. Results: GPT-4o performed poorly on drug-formulation
matching, with frequent omissions of available drug formulations (mean 1.23 per
medication) and hallucinations of formulations that do not exist (mean 1.14 per
medication). Only 49% of tested medications were correctly matched to all
available formulations. Accuracy was decreased for medications with more
formulations (p<0.0001). GPT-4o was also inconsistent at identifying
drug-drug-interactions, although it had better performance with the
search-augmented assessment compared to its internal knowledge (54.7% vs.
69.2%, p=0.013). However, allowing a web-search worsened performance when there
was no drug-drug interaction (median % correct 100% vs. 40%, p<0.001). Finally,
GPT-4o performed moderately with preparing a medication order sentence, with
only 65.8% of medication order sentences containing no medication or
abbreviation errors. Conclusions: Model performance was overall poor for all
tests. This highlights the need for domain-specific training through
clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for
benchmarking performance.

Abstract: Generative AI has established the opportunity to readily transform content
from one medium to another. This capability is especially powerful for
storytelling, where visual illustrations can illuminate a story originally
expressed in text. In this paper, we focus on the task of narrative scene
illustration, which involves automatically generating an image depicting a
scene in a story. Motivated by recent progress on text-to-image models, we
consider a pipeline that uses LLMs as an interface for prompting text-to-image
models to generate scene illustrations given raw story text. We apply
variations of this pipeline to a prominent story corpus in order to synthesize
illustrations for scenes in these stories. We conduct a human annotation task
to obtain pairwise quality judgments for these illustrations. The outcome of
this process is the SceneIllustrations dataset, which we release as a new
resource for future work on cross-modal narrative transformation. Through our
analysis of this dataset and experiments modeling illustration quality, we
demonstrate that LLMs can effectively verbalize scene knowledge implicitly
evoked by story text. Moreover, this capability is impactful for generating and
evaluating illustrations.

TL;DR: 在等计算量条件下，通过注入双向归纳数据来测试能否加速归纳电路出现并提升上下文学习能力。研究发现，虽然小规模模型能加速归纳头出现，但这并不直接转化为更好的泛化性能。自然文本训练的大模型表现最佳，表明机制激活不足以保证上下文学习提升，关键在于电路是否变得功能必要。

Motivation: 测试在等计算量条件下，显式训练归纳电路是否能改善上下文学习，还是自然文本就足够。探究目标合成数据能否加速归纳头出现并增强上下文学习能力。

Method: 引入Bi-Induct轻量级课程，在预训练流中注入前向复制（归纳）、后向复制（反归纳）或平衡混合数据。训练0.13B到1B参数模型，评估少样本上下文学习基准、头级遥测和语言建模困惑度。

Result: Bi-Induct在小规模加速归纳头出现，但不一致提升泛化。标准语言模型基准上，Bi-Induct与纯自然训练相当；函数式上下文学习探针中，1B纯自然模型表现最佳。自然训练的大模型发展出更广泛、更早的归纳头，无需显式归纳模式。

Conclusion: 诱导激活不足以保证上下文学习提升，关键在于这些电路是否变得功能必要。结果强调了机制感知的预训练诊断和培养负载承载（而非仅存在）结构的数据混合方法。

Abstract: Does explicitly exercising the induction circuit during pretraining improve
in-context learning (ICL), or is natural text sufficient when compute is held
constant (iso-FLOPs)? To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate
induction-head emergence and enhance ICL, we introduce Bi-Induct, a lightweight
curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or a
balanced mix into the pretraining stream. We train models from 0.13B to 1B
parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating (i) few-shot ICL benchmarks, (ii)
head-level telemetry, and (iii) held-out language modeling perplexity. Our
findings challenge the assumption that early induction circuit activation
directly improves ICL. While Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at
small scales, this does not consistently yield stronger generalization. On
standard LM benchmarks, Bi-Induct matches natural-only training; on
function-style ICL probes, the 1B natural-only performs best. Stress tests
(e.g., label permutation, HITS@1 vs. HITS@3, 1 vs. 10 shots) preserve these
trends. Telemetry shows larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier
induction heads without explicit induction patterns. Anti-induction data fails
to elicit meaningful activation. Perplexity penalties from synthetic data
shrink with scale, suggesting larger models can absorb non-natural patterns
with minimal cost. Crucially, ablating the top 2% of induction heads degrades
ICL more than random ablations, especially for natural-only models, indicating
more centralized, load-bearing circuits. Bi-Induct variants exhibit more
redundant induction activity, implying different circuit utilization. Overall,
inducing activation is not sufficient: ICL gains depend on these circuits
becoming functionally necessary. These results underscore mechanism-aware
pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing, not merely
present, structure.

Motivation: 理解自监督语音模型在嘈杂环境中识别口语单词时使用的语言表征类型，特别是如何处理语音学和形态学现象。

Method: 研究针对单词识别优化的S3M变体模型，分析它们如何表征英语名词和动词的常见屈折变化，探索其表征的几何结构。

Result: 模型表征展现出全局线性几何结构，可用于关联英语名词和动词与其规则屈折形式，但这种结构不直接追踪语音或形态单位，而是追踪英语词汇中许多词对之间的规则分布关系。

Conclusion: 这些发现提出了可能支持人类口语单词识别的候选表征策略，挑战了语音学和形态学需要独立语言表征的假设。

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models can be trained to efficiently recognize spoken
words in naturalistic, noisy environments. However, we do not understand the
types of linguistic representations these models use to accomplish this task.
To address this question, we study how S3M variants optimized for word
recognition represent phonological and morphological phenomena in frequent
English noun and verb inflections. We find that their representations exhibit a
global linear geometry which can be used to link English nouns and verbs to
their regular inflected forms.
  This geometric structure does not directly track phonological or
morphological units. Instead, it tracks the regular distributional
relationships linking many word pairs in the English lexicon -- often, but not
always, due to morphological inflection. These findings point to candidate
representational strategies that may support human spoken word recognition,
challenging the presumed necessity of distinct linguistic representations of
phonology and morphology.

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统分析了表格表示形式对Table QA性能的影响，通过控制内容不变而改变结构，比较了SQL方法、LLMs和混合方法在不同表格条件下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的Table QA需要处理结构化数据库和半结构化表格，但现有基准测试受限于固定数据格式，未能系统研究表示形式本身对模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用语言化流水线生成配对的结枃化和半结构化表格，创建包含表格大小、连接需求、查询复杂度和模式质量等维度的诊断基准，比较不同建模范式的表现。

Result: SQL方法在结构化输入上准确率高但在半结构化数据上表现下降，LLMs具有灵活性但精度较低，混合方法在噪声模式条件下表现最佳。这些效应随表格增大和查询变复杂而加剧。

Conclusion: 没有单一方法在所有条件下都表现优异，表格表示形式在Table QA性能中起着核心作用，研究结果为模型选择和设计提供了实用见解，为开发适应多样化现实世界数据格式的鲁棒混合方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (Table QA) in real-world settings must operate over
both structured databases and semi-structured tables containing textual fields.
However, existing benchmarks are tied to fixed data formats and have not
systematically examined how representation itself affects model performance. We
present the first controlled study that isolates the role of table
representation by holding content constant while varying structure. Using a
verbalization pipeline, we generate paired structured and semi-structured
tables, enabling direct comparisons across modeling paradigms. To support
detailed analysis, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark with splits along table
size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality. Our experiments
reveal consistent trade-offs: SQL-based methods achieve high accuracy on
structured inputs but degrade on semi-structured data, LLMs exhibit flexibility
but reduced precision, and hybrid approaches strike a balance, particularly
under noisy schemas. These effects intensify with larger tables and more
complex queries. Ultimately, no single method excels across all conditions, and
we highlight the central role of representation in shaping Table QA
performance. Our findings provide actionable insights for model selection and
design, paving the way for more robust hybrid approaches suited for diverse
real-world data formats.

Method: 构建了覆盖400万人的多语言多模态数据集AdamDB；基于布鲁姆分类法设计认知结构化的评估基准AdamBench；提出专门针对传记内容的检索增强生成系统AdamRAG。

Result: AdamRAG显著提升开源模型性能，对闭源模型有适度改善；流行度强烈影响准确性；多模态输入（人脸图像）改善效果较小且不稳定。

Conclusion: ADAM建立了首个基于认知、文化和多模态的传记评估基准和框架，推动了多语言、准确且抗幻觉的多模态大语言模型发展。

Abstract: We introduce ADAM (A Diverse Archive of Mankind), a framework for evaluating
and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical
reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet
underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a
multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across
geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively
structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels
in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly
for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that
AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits
closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity
strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers
smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the
first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally
grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual,
accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

Abstract: This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with
large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for
comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis
was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of
topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing
human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human
corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown
Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in
Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic,
Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and
are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are
tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The
subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on
average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on
average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely
available for download under the CC BY 4.0 license (the annotated data are
under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence) and are also accessible through the search

TL;DR: ReMemR1是一种具有回调增强记忆的内存增强代理，通过选择性检索整个记忆历史来支持非线性推理和早期证据重访，结合多级奖励强化学习来解决长上下文问答中的信息丢失和训练信号稀疏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在长上下文问答中面临关键证据分散在数百万token中的挑战，现有的"边读边记"方法存在不可逆的前向处理、信息覆盖丢失和稀疏强化学习信号等问题。

Method: 提出ReMemR1内存增强代理，具有回调增强记忆机制，允许从整个记忆历史中选择性检索；同时提出多级奖励强化学习(RLMLR)，结合最终答案奖励和密集的步骤级信号来指导有效内存使用。

Result: 在长文档问答实验中对现有基于内存的方法取得了显著提升，验证了ReMemR1作为长上下文推理代理的有效解决方案。

Conclusion: ReMemR1通过回调增强记忆和多级奖励强化学习的结合，有效缓解了信息退化问题，改善了监督训练，支持多跳内存利用，为长上下文推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models face challenges in long-context question answering,
where key evidence of a query may be dispersed across millions of tokens.
Existing works equip large language models with a memory corpus that is
dynamically updated during a single-pass document scan, also known as the
"memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it
suffers from irreversible forward-only processing, information loss through
overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these
challenges, we present ReMemR1, a memory-augmented agent with callback-enhanced
memory that allows selective retrieval from the entire memory history and
allows non-linear reasoning and revisiting of early evidence. To further
strengthen training, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards
(RLMLR), which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals
that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate
information degradation, improve supervision, and support multi-hop memory
utilizing. Experiments on long-document QA show significant gains over existing
memory-based approaches, which validates ReMemR1 as an effective solution for
long-context reasoning agents.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM在MADS中的奉承行为，提出了首个操作框架来定义和评估多智能体辩论中的奉承现象，发现奉承会导致辩论过早达成共识并降低准确性，最后提出了平衡分歧与合作的设计原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的奉承行为对依赖建设性分歧的多智能体辩论系统构成挑战，可能导致辩论过早达成共识。现有研究主要关注用户-LLM奉承，而智能体间奉承在辩论中的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 提出了首个操作框架：(1) 为MADS环境定义奉承的正式概念；(2) 开发新指标评估智能体奉承水平及其对信息交换的影响；(3) 系统研究不同智能体角色（辩论者和评判者）奉承水平对去中心化和中心化辩论框架结果的影响。

Result: 研究发现奉承是核心失败模式，会在达成正确结论前放大分歧崩溃，导致准确性低于单智能体基线，并源于辩论者驱动和评判者驱动两种不同的失败模式。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，提出了可操作的多智能体辩论系统设计原则，有效平衡智能体交互中的建设性分歧与合作。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often display sycophancy, a tendency toward
excessive agreeability. This behavior poses significant challenges for
multi-agent debating systems (MADS) that rely on productive disagreement to
refine arguments and foster innovative thinking. LLMs' inherent sycophancy can
collapse debates into premature consensus, potentially undermining the benefits
of multi-agent debate. While prior studies focus on user--LLM sycophancy, the
impact of inter-agent sycophancy in debate remains poorly understood. To
address this gap, we introduce the first operational framework that (1)
proposes a formal definition of sycophancy specific to MADS settings, (2)
develops new metrics to evaluate the agent sycophancy level and its impact on
information exchange in MADS, and (3) systematically investigates how varying
levels of sycophancy across agent roles (debaters and judges) affects outcomes
in both decentralized and centralized debate frameworks. Our findings reveal
that sycophancy is a core failure mode that amplifies disagreement collapse
before reaching a correct conclusion in multi-agent debates, yields lower
accuracy than single-agent baselines, and arises from distinct debater-driven
and judge-driven failure modes. Building on these findings, we propose
actionable design principles for MADS, effectively balancing productive
disagreement with cooperation in agent interactions.

Motivation: 监督数据获取成本上升推动了对大语言模型自我改进的兴趣。传统自评估方法存在计算开销大和过度自信问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出语义投票机制，将硬匹配原则（精确匹配）放松为软匹配（语义相似度），使用轻量级句子嵌入模型量化语义相似度。

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法在计算效率和整体性能上都优于自评估方法，适用于不同模型架构和任务。

Conclusion: 语义投票为不可验证任务提供了一种计算高效且有效的自我改进方法，克服了传统自评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: The rising cost of acquiring supervised data has driven significant interest
in self-improvement for large language models (LLMs). Straightforward
unsupervised signals like majority voting have proven effective in generating
pseudo-labels for verifiable tasks, while their applicability to unverifiable
tasks (e.g., translation) is limited by the open-ended character of responses.
As a result, self-evaluation mechanisms (e.g., self-judging and entropy
minimization) are predominantly used to derive pseudo-labels. However,
self-evaluation relying on LLMs typically incurs high computational overhead
and introduces overconfidence issues due to intrinsic biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel self-evaluation-free approach for unverifiable
tasks, designed for lightweight yet effective self-improvement. Inspired by
majority voting commonly employed in verifiable tasks, we propose semantic
voting as a novel mechanism that relaxes the principle of hard matching (i.e.,
exact matching) toward soft matching (i.e., semantic similarity). Soft matching
is achieved by leveraging a lightweight sentence embedding model to quantify
semantic similarity, thereby mitigating excessive computational burden and
intrinsic bias-associated limitations of self-evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial gains in
computational efficiency and overall better performance than self-evaluation
methods across diverse model architectures and tasks.

TL;DR: EviPath提出了一种基于证据锚定的推理路径合成范式，用于解决RAG代理开发中缺乏过程级监督的问题，通过任务分解、忠实子问题回答和对话微调，显著提升了模型在问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强生成代理开发缺乏过程级监督，难以有效指导任务分解、检索器调用和逐步决策等能力。强化学习存在奖励稀疏和LLM推理能力有限的问题，现有数据合成方法只能产生思维链推理而无法建模环境交互。

Method: EviPath包含三个核心组件：(1)溯因子任务规划：将问题分解为子问题并基于依赖关系迭代规划最优解路径；(2)忠实子问题回答：使用支持证据构建代理环境来生成每个子问题的推理思路和答案；(3)对话微调：将完整的代理-环境交互轨迹格式化为适合监督微调的对话格式。

Result: 在广泛使用的问答基准测试中，使用EviPath合成数据训练的8B参数模型显著且一致地优于最先进的基线方法，在开放域问答中实现了14.7%的绝对EM增益。

Conclusion: EviPath使LLM能够直接从合成数据中学习复杂的推理和工具使用能力，为RAG代理开发提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation agents development is hindered by the lack of
process-level supervision to effectively guide agentic capabilities like task
decomposition, retriever invocation, and stepwise decision-making. While
reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse
rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought
rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we
propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG
agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which
decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal
solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful
Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy
environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question;
and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete
agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for
Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and
tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on
widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model
trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of
14.7% in open-domain question answering.

TL;DR: 提出使用置信集（credal sets）的几何框架来量化和分解神经网络文本生成中的不确定性，通过分析50万个故事发现现有模型在捕捉人类创造性变异方面存在显著差距，最佳模型-人类校准仅为0.434。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型中的不确定性是一个基本挑战，特别是在存在多个有效输出的创造性任务中。需要一种方法来量化和分解不确定性，以实现更好的人机创造性对齐。

Method: 使用置信集（概率分布的凸包）的几何框架，分析WritingPrompts数据集中500个创意写作提示，每个提示有10个人类续写，评估4个语言模型在5种解码策略下生成的10万个故事。

Result: 置信集分析显示在捕捉人类创造性变异方面存在显著差距，最佳模型-人类校准仅为0.434（Gemma-2B，温度0.7）。解码策略选择对总认知不确定性的贡献为39.4%到72.0%。模型规模与校准质量相关性弱，基础模型和指令调优模型在校准质量上无显著差异。

Conclusion: 几何框架为改进生成系统以实现人机创造性对齐提供了可操作的见解，并发布了完整的实验框架。

Abstract: Understanding uncertainty in large language models remains a fundamental
challenge, particularly in creative tasks where multiple valid outputs exist.
We present a geometric framework using credal sets - convex hulls of
probability distributions - to quantify and decompose uncertainty in neural
text generation, calibrated against human creative variation. Analyzing 500
creative writing prompts from the WritingPrompts dataset with 10 unique human
continuations each, we evaluate four language models across five decoding
strategies, generating 100,000 stories. Our credal set analysis reveals
substantial gaps in capturing human creative variation, with the best
model-human calibration reaching only 0.434 (Gemma-2B with temperature 0.7). We
decompose total uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, finding
that the choice of decoding strategy contributes 39.4% to 72.0% of total
epistemic uncertainty. Model scale shows weak correlation with calibration
quality and no significant difference exists between base and instruction-tuned
models in calibration quality. Our geometric framework provides actionable
insights for improving generation systems for human-AI creative alignment. We
release our complete experimental framework.

TL;DR: d²Cache是一个无需训练的双向注意力KV缓存框架，通过两阶段细粒度选择策略加速扩散式大语言模型的推理，同时提高生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型(dLLMs)由于依赖双向注意力机制，无法像自回归模型那样直接受益于标准的KV缓存，导致推理效率低下。

Method: 提出d²Cache框架，采用两阶段细粒度选择策略：识别关键token并自适应更新其KV状态，同时缓存其余token的KV状态以供重用。

Result: 在LLaDA和Dream等代表性dLLMs上的实验表明，d²Cache不仅实现了显著的推理加速，还带来了生成质量的一致提升。

Conclusion: d²Cache为dLLMs提供了一种有效的推理加速方案，同时支持准左到右生成，缓解序列末端token的过早过度自信问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), despite their promising
performance, still suffer from inferior inference efficiency. This is because
dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention and cannot directly benefit from the
standard key-value (KV) cache as autoregressive models (ARMs) do. To tackle
this issue, we introduce \textit{Dual aDaptive Cache} (d$^2$Cache), which is a
training-free approximate KV cache framework for accelerating dLLM inference.
d$^2$Cache features a two-stage fine-grained selection strategy to identify
tokens and adaptively update their KV states at each decoding step, while
caching the KV states of the remaining tokens for reuse. Furthermore,
d$^2$Cache naturally offers a more reliable decoding alternative, which can
enable quasi left-to-right generation and mitigate premature overconfidence in
tokens at the end of the sequence. Extensive experimental results on two
representative dLLMs (\ie, LLaDA and Dream) demonstrate that d$^2$Cache not
only achieves substantial inference speedups, but also yields consistent
improvements in generation quality. The code is available at

Motivation: LLMs在少样本设置下使用SMILES表示生成分子时难以保证有效性，而使用SELFIES表示时性能反而更差，需要一种方法确保分子生成的有效性。

Method: 开发了SmiSelf跨化学语言框架，通过语法规则将无效SMILES转换为SELFIES，利用SELFIES的机制来修正无效SMILES。

Result: SmiSelf确保了100%的分子有效性，同时保持了分子特性，在其他指标上维持或提升了性能。

Conclusion: SmiSelf扩展了LLMs在生物医学中的实际应用，与所有基于SMILES的生成模型兼容。

Abstract: Molecule generation is key to drug discovery and materials science, enabling
the design of novel compounds with specific properties. Large language models
(LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of tasks from just a few examples.
However, generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES is
challenging for LLMs in few-shot settings. In this work, we explore how LLMs
can generate 100% valid molecules. We evaluate whether LLMs can use SELFIES, a
representation where every string corresponds to a valid molecule, for valid
molecule generation but find that LLMs perform worse with SELFIES than with
SMILES. We then examine LLMs' ability to correct invalid SMILES and find their
capacity limited. Finally, we introduce SmiSelf, a cross-chemical language
framework for invalid SMILES correction. SmiSelf converts invalid SMILES to
SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct the
invalid SMILES. Experiments show that SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while
preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing
performance on other metrics. SmiSelf helps expand LLMs' practical applications
in biomedicine and is compatible with all SMILES-based generative models. Code

Simulation TL;DR: A non-collaborative user simulation method for tool agent.
Abstract: Tool agents interact with users through multi-turn dialogues to
accomplish various tasks. Recent studies have adopted user simulation methods
to develop these agents in multi-turn settings. However, existing user
simulators tend to be agent-friendly, exhibiting only cooperative behaviors,
which fails to train and test agents against non-collaborative users in the
real world. To address this, we propose a novel user simulator architecture
that simulates four categories of non-collaborative behaviors: requesting
unavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing
impatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Our user simulator can
simulate challenging and natural non-collaborative behaviors while reliably
delivering all intents and information necessary to accomplish the task. Our
experiments on MultiWOZ and $\tau$-bench reveal significant performance
degradation in state-of-the-art tool agents when encountering non-collaborative
users. We provide detailed analyses of agents' weaknesses under each
non-collaborative condition, such as escalated hallucinations and dialogue
breakdowns. Ultimately, we contribute an easily extensible user simulation
framework to help the research community develop tool agents and preemptively
diagnose them under challenging real-world conditions within their own
services.

Motivation: LLMs在通用推理方面表现出色，但在个性化推理方面存在不足，无法有效分析用户历史、推断独特偏好并生成定制化响应。

Method: 开发数据驱动管道自动生成语义标记的推理链，采用SFT建立基础推理模式，然后进行多阶段RL训练，使用包含标签约束和PRMU的复合奖励信号。

Result: 在LaMP基准和自建数据集上实现最先进结果，相比基础模型在所有任务上平均提升32.65%。

Conclusion: 结构化、可解释的推理是解锁LLMs真正个性化能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with impressive
general reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with personalization
reasoning - the crucial ability to analyze user history, infer unique
preferences, and generate tailored responses. To address this limitation, we
introduce TagPR, a novel training framework that significantly enhances an
LLM's intrinsic capacity for personalization reasoning through a tagging the
thought approach. Our method first develops a data-driven pipeline to
automatically generate and semantically label reasoning chains, creating a
structured dataset that fosters interpretable reasoning. We then propose a
synergistic training strategy that begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on
this tagged data to establish foundational reasoning patterns, followed by a
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) process. This RL phase is guided by a
unique composite reward signal, which integrates tag-based constraints and a
novel Personalization Reward Model with User Embeddings (PRMU) to achieve
fine-grained alignment with user-specific logic. Extensive experiments on the
public LaMP benchmark and a self-constructed dataset demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results, delivering an average improvement
of 32.65% over the base model across all tasks. Our work validates that
structured, interpretable reasoning is a highly effective pathway to unlocking
genuine personalization capabilities in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TReASURe是一种基于树搜索的测试时对齐方法，通过UnmaskBranch分支策略和ResubstituteScore剪枝规则，解决了掩码扩散语言模型中树搜索的两个关键挑战：并行解掩导致高度相关分支和奖励评估的高方差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将树搜索应用于掩码扩散语言模型时面临两个主要挑战：(i)并行解掩产生高度相关的分支，限制了探索；(ii)通过采样完成进行奖励评估会产生高方差估计，导致剪枝不稳定。

Method: 提出TReASURe方法，包含：(i)UnmaskBranch分支策略，基于首次命中解掩，通过每个父节点单次模型调用实现令牌内容和揭示顺序的多样化；(ii)ResubstituteScore剪枝规则，使用确定性重替换以低方差代理完成对部分掩码序列进行评分。

Result: 在困惑度、语言可接受性以及情感和毒性控制方面达到最先进结果，在匹配计算预算下优于先前方法，在低NFE（函数评估次数）机制下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: TReASURe通过理论分析和实证验证，有效解决了掩码扩散语言模型中树搜索的关键挑战，在多个指标上实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Tree search has recently emerged as a powerful framework for aligning
generative models with task-specific rewards at test time. Applying tree search
to Masked Diffusion Language Models, however, introduces two key challenges:
(i) parallel unmasking yields highly correlated branches, limiting exploration,
and (ii) reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance
estimates, making pruning unstable. We propose TReASURe, a tree-search
test-time alignment method that addresses these issues. It introduces (i)
UnmaskBranch, a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that
diversifies both token content and reveal order with a single model call per
parent node, and (ii) ResubstituteScore, a pruning rule that uses deterministic
resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy
completions. Theoretically, we quantify branching efficiency gains in NFEs
(number of function evaluations), show that the scoring rule approximates the
true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and prove
improvements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves
state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control
of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute
budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.

<details>

Motivation: LLMs在多轮交互中性能下降，因为它们主要基于静态单轮数据训练，难以适应实时用户反馈。

Method: 提出T2PAM范式和ROSA算法，利用用户反馈估计最优策略，通过单步更新少量参数实现高效策略调整。

Result: 理论分析证明ROSA策略会收敛到用户偏好，实验显示在任务效果和效率上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: T2PAM和ROSA有效解决了LLMs在多轮交互中的性能退化问题，实现了高效的自适应对话能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) employ multi-turn interaction as a fundamental
paradigm for completing complex tasks. However, their performance often
degrades in extended interactions, as they are typically trained on static,
single-turn data, which hinders their ability to adapt to real-time user
feedback. To address this limitation, we first propose a new paradigm:
Test-Time Policy Adaptation for Multi-Turn Interactions (T2PAM), which utilizes
user feedback from the ongoing interaction as a reward signal to estimate a
latent optimal policy aligned with user preferences, then updates a small
subset of parameters to steer the model toward this policy, ultimately enabling
efficient in-conversation self-correction. We then introduce Optimum-Referenced
One-Step Adaptation (ROSA), a lightweight algorithm that operationalizes T2PAM.
ROSA guides the model parameters toward a theoretical optimal policy in a
single, efficient update step, avoiding costly iterative gradient-based
optimization and minimizing computational overhead. We provide a rigorous
theoretical analysis guaranteeing that the policy of ROSA converges to the
preference of user as the number of interactions increases. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmark demonstrate that ROSA achieves significant

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的预训练方法：使用潜在思维预训练语言模型，通过在生成每个token前先生成一个中间潜在思维（隐藏状态）来提升模型性能，在相同推理成本下能超越参数翻倍的基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Chain-of-Thought在测试时通过增加生成步骤提升性能的启发，探索是否能在预训练阶段通过增加计算步骤来改善每个token的生成质量。

Method: 预训练语言模型先生成中间潜在思维（当前位置的最后一个隐藏状态），然后使用该潜在思维作为输入来预测实际的下一个token，这种额外的计算步骤让模型能在无约束的连续空间中优化预测。

Result: 在相同推理成本下，生成一个额外潜在思维的1.4B模型显著超越了在相同数据上训练的2.8B基准模型，在语言建模和各种下游任务上都表现更好。增加潜在思维数量能持续提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 通过预训练阶段引入类似CoT的链式潜在思维生成，能有效提升语言模型的性能，在相同计算成本下实现更好的效果。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which enhances performance
by scaling generation steps at test-time, inspires us to ask: can we leverage a
similar scaling of computational steps during pretraining to improve the
generation of each individual token? To address this, we propose a novel
pre-training methodology: Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts. Our
approach pretrains a language model (LM) to first generate an intermediate
latent thought-the last hidden state of the current position-which is then used
as input to predict the actual subsequent token. This additional computational
step enables the LM to refine its prediction within unconstrained continuous
space. Our experiments demonstrate that, at an identical inference cost, a LM
that generates one additional latent thought per token outperforms a standard
model with double the parameters. For instance, ours-1.4B (Pythia Arch),
pretrained on 300B tokens from the Pile, significantly surpasses the vanilla
Pythia-2.8B trained on the same data on both language modeling and a range of
general downstream tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of latent thoughts
generated before each actual token-forming a chain analogous to
CoT-consistently improves the model's performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一个三阶段框架来解决多智能体系统中的指令冲突问题：诊断（CRAS评分）、定位（注意力漂移分析）和对齐（SAIL手术式微调），显著提升了指令层级合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统在复杂任务中表现出色，但存在系统性故障模式：在指令冲突（系统-用户、对等体之间）时的层级合规问题，且宏观指标无法揭示微观违规行为。

Method: 1) 诊断：提出情境化角色遵从评分（CRAS），将角色遵从分解为四个可测量维度；2) 定位：注意力漂移分析发现指令冲突主要由中间层注意力头解决；3) 对齐：手术式指令层对齐（SAIL），仅在定位的焦点层安装LoRA，优化基于令牌权重的DPO风格偏好目标。

Result: 在标准基准和多智能体系统框架上，该方法显著提升了指令层级合规性（如在AutoGen上MedQA任务提升+5.60%），无需全模型微调。

Conclusion: 提出的三阶段框架能有效诊断、定位和解决多智能体系统中的指令冲突问题，通过手术式微调方法在保持效率的同时显著提升系统可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have rapidly
advanced collaborative reasoning, tool use, and role-specialized coordination
in complex tasks. However, reliability-critical deployment remains hindered by
a systemic failure mode: hierarchical compliance under instruction conflicts
(system-user, peer-peer), where agents misprioritize system-level rules in the
presence of competing demands. Moreover, widely used macro-level metrics (e.g.,
pass@k) obscure these micro-level violations and offer little actionable
guidance for remedy. In this work, we present a full-stack, three-stage
framework: (1) Diagnose - Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS), a
query-wise, context-aware scoring metric that decomposes role adherence into
four measurable dimensions; (2) Localize - attention drift analysis revealing
that instruction conflicts are resolved by attention heads that are largely
concentrated in middle layers; (3) Align - Surgical Alignment of Instruction
Layers (SAIL), which installs LoRA only on the localized focal layers and
optimizes a token-weighted DPO-style preference objective that credits tokens
by their focal attentional contribution. Across standard benchmarks and MAS
frameworks, our surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance
(e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without full-model finetuning.

### [41] [Estimating the strength and timing of syntactic structure building in naturalistic reading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23195)
*Nan Wang,Jiaxuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A central question in psycholinguistics is the timing of syntax in sentence
processing. Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which
conflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase
structure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows
category detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking
data from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their
temporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze
transitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads,
suggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize
scanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was
the strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical
familiarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated
that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to
-10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend
current models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure
construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences,
supporting a predictive "tree-scaffolding" account of comprehension.

Motivation: 解决推理大语言模型在少样本思维链提示下表现不如直接回答的矛盾现象，探究演示示例导致性能下降的机制。

Method: 提出Insight-to-Solve框架，将演示转化为明确的、可重用的见解，并生成目标特定的推理轨迹；可选地通过自我精炼提高连贯性和正确性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，I2S和I2S+方法持续优于直接回答和测试时扩展基线，GPT-4.1在AIME'25上提升14.0%，o1-mini在多个基准上也有显著改进。

Conclusion: 通过洞察-精炼-解决框架，可以有效地利用上下文演示来提升推理大语言模型的性能，解决了少样本思维链提示的局限性。

Abstract: Recent reasoning LLMs (RLMs), especially those trained with verifier-based
reinforcement learning, often perform worse with few-shot CoT than with direct
answering. We revisit this paradox using high-quality reasoning traces from
DeepSeek-R1 as demonstrations and find that adding more exemplars consistently
degrades accuracy, even when demonstrations are optimal. A detailed analysis
reveals two mechanisms behind this decline: (i) semantic misguidance, where
high textual similarity leads the model to treat the target as the same as the
exemplar and to copy intermediate steps verbatim; and (ii) strategy transfer
failure, where the model struggles to extract useful reasoning strategies and
apply them to target questions. Guided by these, we introduce Insight-to-Solve
(I2S), a sequential test-time procedure that turns demonstrations into
explicit, reusable insights and derives a target-specific reasoning trace;
optionally, the reasoning is self-refined for coherence and correctness (I2S+).
Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that I2S and I2S+ consistently
outperform both direct answering and test-time scaling baselines across open-
and closed-source models. Even for GPT models, our method helps: on AIME'25,
GPT-4.1 rises by +14.0%, and o1-mini improves by +2.7% on AIME and +1.7% on
GPQA, indicating that in-context demonstrations can be harnessed effectively
via insight-refine-solve framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究K-pop歌曲在全球榜单成功背后的语言策略，特别是语码转换和英语歌词使用的作用，以理解全球市场压力如何影响K-pop的语言选择。

Method: 收集2017-2025年登上Billboard Hot 100和Global 200榜单的K-pop歌曲数据集，分析英语和韩语歌词比例、语码转换频率等风格特征，并进行统计测试和分类任务。

Result: 英语在全球成功的K-pop歌曲中占主导地位，男女表演者都表现出高度的语码转换和英语使用。分类任务使用多语言嵌入和手工特征预测表演者性别，宏F1分数达0.76。

Conclusion: K-pop歌词中的语言选择受到全球市场压力的影响，英语使用对于在美国市场的成功更为关键，同时揭示了反映表演者身份和榜单背景的风格模式。

Abstract: Code switching, particularly between Korean and English, has become a
defining feature of modern K-pop, reflecting both aesthetic choices and global
market strategies. This paper is a primary investigation into the linguistic
strategies employed in K-pop songs that achieve global chart success, with a
focus on the role of code-switching and English lyric usage. A dataset of K-pop
songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts from 2017 to
2025, spanning 14 groups and 8 solo artists, was compiled. Using this dataset,
the proportion of English and Korean lyrics, the frequency of code-switching,
and other stylistic features were analysed. It was found that English dominates
the linguistic landscape of globally charting K-pop songs, with both male and
female performers exhibiting high degrees of code-switching and English usage.
Statistical tests indicated no significant gender-based differences, although
female solo artists tend to favour English more consistently. A classification
task was also performed to predict performer gender from lyrics, achieving
macro F1 scores up to 0.76 using multilingual embeddings and handcrafted
features. Finally, differences between songs charting on the Hot 100 versus the
Global 200 were examined, suggesting that, while there is no significant gender
difference in English, higher English usage may be more critical for success in
the US-focused Hot 100. The findings highlight how linguistic choices in K-pop
lyrics are shaped by global market pressures and reveal stylistic patterns that
reflect performer identity and chart context.

TL;DR: 研究揭示Gemma-2语言模型在处理介词短语时存在工具性解读偏好，通过调控单个注意力头可以改变介词补语的功能角色分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解语言模型在生成介词短语时如何决定补语是作为工具性附加语还是属性修饰语的内在机制。

Method: 构建包含with引导介词短语的提示集，通过将激活投影到词汇空间识别偏好注意力头，并缩放其值向量来调控生成。

Result: 模型对工具性解读有强烈偏好(3:4比例)，调控单个注意力头可将工具性解读降至33%，属性解读提升至36%。

Conclusion: 语言模型对介词短语的功能角色分配存在系统性偏好，可通过干预特定注意力头来调控这种分布。

Abstract: Language Models, when generating prepositional phrases, must often decide for
whether their complements functions as an instrumental adjunct (describing the
verb adverbially) or an attributive modifier (enriching the noun adjectivally),
yet the internal mechanisms that resolve this split decision remain poorly
understood. In this study, we conduct a targeted investigation into Gemma-2 to
uncover and control the generation of prepositional complements. We assemble a
prompt suite containing with-headed prepositional phrases whose contexts
equally accommodate either an instrumental or attributive continuation,
revealing a strong preference for an instrumental reading at a ratio of 3:4. To
pinpoint individual attention heads that favor instrumental over attributive
complements, we project activations into the vocabulary space. By scaling the
value vector of a single attention head, we can shift the distribution of
functional roles of complements, attenuating instruments to 33% while elevating
attributes to 36%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用如旅行规划或多阶段数据分析通常涉及多轮对话，现有方法要么将多轮训练简化为孤立单轮样本，要么使用端到端强化学习但存在冗余问题，缺乏明确的进度感知整合。

Method: PARL-MT包含：(1)进度感知生成(PAG)管道，自动构建结合对话摘要和未来任务规划的数据集；(2)进度感知引导强化学习(PAG-RL)算法，将进度感知整合到RL训练中。

Result: 在两个公共基准测试上的实证结果表明，PARL-MT显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 进度感知机制在实现稳健高效的多轮函数调用方面具有有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success in single-turn
function calling, yet real-world applications such as travel planning or
multi-stage data analysis typically unfold across multi-turn conversations. In
these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step
but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past
interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task
execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to
isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks
explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness
into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a
Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs
datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a
Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which
integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy
and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT
significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of
progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function
calling.

Abstract: This study aims to test and evaluate the capabilities and characteristics of
current mainstream Visual Language Models (VLMs) in generating critiques for
traditional Chinese painting. To achieve this, we first developed a
quantitative framework for Chinese painting critique. This framework was
constructed by extracting multi-dimensional evaluative features covering
evaluative stance, feature focus, and commentary quality from human expert
critiques using a zero-shot classification model. Based on these features,
several representative critic personas were defined and quantified. This
framework was then employed to evaluate selected VLMs such as Llama, Qwen, or
Gemini. The experimental design involved persona-guided prompting to assess the
VLM's ability to generate critiques from diverse perspectives. Our findings
reveal the current performance levels, strengths, and areas for improvement of
VLMs in the domain of art critique, offering insights into their potential and
limitations in complex semantic understanding and content generation tasks. The

Motivation: 维基百科作为最大的开放知识库，被广泛用于训练大语言模型和检索增强生成系统，确保其准确性至关重要。本文关注事实不一致性这一特定类型的错误。

Method: 提出CLAIRE系统，结合LLM推理与检索技术，识别潜在不一致声明并提供上下文证据供人工审核。构建WIKICOLLIDE基准数据集，采用随机抽样和CLAIRE辅助分析。

Result: 用户研究中，87.5%的编辑者使用CLAIRE后信心更高，在相同时间内多识别64.7%的不一致性。发现至少3.3%的英文维基百科事实存在矛盾，这些不一致性传播到7.3%的FEVEROUS和4.0%的AmbigQA示例中。最佳自动化系统的AUROC仅为75.1%。

Conclusion: 矛盾是维基百科中可测量的组成部分，基于LLM的系统如CLAIRE可以为编辑者提供实用工具，帮助大规模提高知识一致性。

Abstract: Wikipedia is the largest open knowledge corpus, widely used worldwide and
serving as a key resource for training large language models (LLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Ensuring its accuracy is
therefore critical. But how accurate is Wikipedia, and how can we improve it?
  We focus on inconsistencies, a specific type of factual inaccuracy, and
introduce the task of corpus-level inconsistency detection. We present CLAIRE,
an agentic system that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval to surface
potentially inconsistent claims along with contextual evidence for human
review. In a user study with experienced Wikipedia editors, 87.5% reported
higher confidence when using CLAIRE, and participants identified 64.7% more
inconsistencies in the same amount of time.
  Combining CLAIRE with human annotation, we contribute WIKICOLLIDE, the first
benchmark of real Wikipedia inconsistencies. Using random sampling with
CLAIRE-assisted analysis, we find that at least 3.3% of English Wikipedia facts
contradict another fact, with inconsistencies propagating into 7.3% of FEVEROUS
and 4.0% of AmbigQA examples. Benchmarking strong baselines on this dataset
reveals substantial headroom: the best fully automated system achieves an AUROC
of only 75.1%.
  Our results show that contradictions are a measurable component of Wikipedia
and that LLM-based systems like CLAIRE can provide a practical tool to help
editors improve knowledge consistency at scale.

Conclusion: 提供了一个可部署的金融对话挖掘解决方案，支持批量评估、可视化和校准输出

Abstract: Financial dialogue transcripts pose a unique challenge for sentence-level
information extraction due to their informal structure, domain-specific
vocabulary, and variable intent density. We introduce Fin-ExBERT, a lightweight
and modular framework for extracting user intent-relevant sentences from
annotated financial service calls. Our approach builds on a domain-adapted BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) backbone enhanced
with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters, enabling efficient fine-tuning using
limited labeled data. We propose a two-stage training strategy with progressive
unfreezing: initially training a classifier head while freezing the backbone,
followed by gradual fine-tuning of the entire model with differential learning
rates. To ensure robust extraction under uncertainty, we adopt a dynamic
thresholding strategy based on probability curvature (elbow detection),
avoiding fixed cutoff heuristics. Empirical results show strong precision and
F1 performance on real-world transcripts, with interpretable output suitable
for downstream auditing and question-answering workflows. The full framework
supports batched evaluation, visualization, and calibrated export, offering a
deployable solution for financial dialogue mining.

TL;DR: A2D是一种针对扩散大语言模型的token级对齐方法，通过在任何有害内容出现时发出[EOS]拒绝信号，实现对任意解码顺序和任意步骤预填充攻击的防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型的任意顺序生成特性扩大了攻击面，有害内容可能出现在任意位置，且模板预填充攻击（如DIJA）能够绕过响应级拒绝机制。

Method: 在随机掩码下直接在token级进行安全对齐，使模型在出现有害内容时发出[EOS]拒绝信号，支持实时监控和自动终止不安全生成。

Result: 在安全基准测试中，A2D始终阻止有害输出生成，将DIJA成功率从80%以上降至接近零（LLaDA-8B-Instruct为1.3%，Dream-v0-Instruct-7B为0.0%），阈值化[EOS]概率可实现早期拒绝，安全终止速度提升高达19.3倍。

Conclusion: A2D方法有效解决了扩散大语言模型的安全对齐问题，提供了对任意顺序和任意步骤攻击的鲁棒防御，同时支持实时安全监控。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) enable any-order generation, but this
flexibility enlarges the attack surface: harmful spans may appear at arbitrary
positions, and template-based prefilling attacks such as DIJA bypass
response-level refusals. We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a
token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal
whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level
under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order
and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables
real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if
unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents
the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to
near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and
thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x
faster safe termination.

Motivation: 政策合规评估需要专家进行系统性的逐步推理，但这种黄金标准的推理过程获取成本高昂。

Method: 引入PRT（政策推理轨迹）作为专门的生成推理链，在推理时和训练时使用这些推理链作为推理桥梁。

Result: 使用PRT显著提升了开源和商业模型的性能，在HIPAA和GDPR政策上达到新的SOTA，同时提高了政策条款引用的准确性。

Conclusion: PRT不仅能提高政策合规评估的准确性，还能改善LLM准确引用政策条款的能力，通过高利用率影响合规决策。

Abstract: Policy compliance assessment is a fundamental task of evaluating whether an
input case strictly complies with a set of human-defined rules, more generally
known as policies. In practice, human experts follow a systematic, step-by-step
process to identify violations with respect to specific stipulations outlined
in the policy. However, such documentation of gold-standard, expert-level
reasoning processes is costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce Policy
Reasoning Traces (PRT), a form of specialized generated reasoning chains that
serve as a reasoning bridge to improve an LLM's policy compliance assessment
capabilities. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the use of PRTs for
both inference-time and training-time scenarios significantly enhances the
performance of open-weight and commercial models, setting a new
state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. Beyond accuracy gains, we also
highlight how PRTs can improve an LLM's ability to accurately cite policy
clauses, as well as influence compliance decisions through their high
utilization from the raw chains of thought.

Conclusion: SIE框架为LLM推理训练提供了可扩展、可泛化且可验证的环境，显著提升了推理能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) via environmental
exploration. As the intrinsic properties of the environment determine the
abilities that LLMs can learn, the environment plays a important role in the RL
finetuning process. An ideal LLM reasoning environment should possess three
core characteristics: scalability, generalizable reasoning, and verifiability.
However, existing mathematical and coding environments are difficult to scale
due to heavy reliance on expert annotation, while the skills learned in
game-based environments are too specialized to generalize. To bridge this gap,
we introduce the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{E}nvironment
(SIE) framework. SIE achieves scalability by automatically constructing
reasoning environments from large-scale structured data, where the rich
compositional patterns naturally support generalizable reasoning. Moreover, the
explicit schemas and reasoning chains in structured data provide a foundation
for rule-based verifiability. Experimental results show that SIE framework not
only achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning, but
also enables the learned compositional reasoning skills to generalize
effectively to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. We
further explored learning in information-limited partial SIEs and found that
LLMs can infer the missing information through exploring the environment,
leading to robust reasoning improvements and generalization performance.

Result: 在Qwen3-8B模型上，HotpotQA达到70.67%，IFBench达到43.88%，分别比GEPA高出4.95%和2.73%；在GPT-4.1-mini上，IFBench准确率提升至47.96%，MATH基准达到95.33%。

Conclusion: C-Evolve通过群体共识机制能够产生和维护具有更高潜力的提示，在开放性和封闭性任务中都表现出竞争优势。

Abstract: Prompt evolution algorithms offer a powerful paradigm for enhancing AI
systems based on closed-source models, while few work explores whether
aggregating results from multiple prompts to reach a consensus can further
advance the system capability boundary. In this paper, we introduce
Consensus-Evolve (C-Evolve), an evolutionary algorithm that discovers a group
of prompts whose aggregated outputs after majority voting achieve optimal
performance. More specifically, C-Evolve employs an island-based evolutionary
algorithm to maintain population diversity, and prompts from distinct islands
are selected to form groups to aggregate their outputs. The key difference from
single individual evolution is a voting score, which evaluates each individual
prompt's contribution within groups. We take this as the fitness score for
evolution instead of individual performance. Consequently, C-Evolve is more
likely to produce and maintain prompts with higher potential to form a
high-performing group and eliminate low-performing ones, gradually improving
the group performance after reaching consensus. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks, including both
open-ended tasks like HotpotQA and closed-ended tasks like MATH. On Qwen3-8B,
C-Evolve achieves 70.67% on HotpotQA and 43.88% on IFBench, which are 4.95% and
2.73% higher than GEPA, respectively. For GPT-4.1-mini, the accuracy on IFBench
is further improved to 47.96% and reaches 95.33% in the MATH benchmark. These
results demonstrate the C-Evolve's competitive performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM是一个统一的机器遗忘框架，通过在表示空间和参数空间实施双重平滑性来提高鲁棒性和平衡遗忘指标，解决了现有方法中的灾难性遗忘和指标不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，机器遗忘技术需要解决用户隐私、版权侵权和安全问题。现有方法存在灾难性遗忘和指标不平衡，以及易受重新学习和越狱攻击的问题。

Method: PRISM框架包含两个平滑优化阶段：表示空间阶段使用鲁棒训练的探针防御越狱攻击；参数空间阶段解耦保留-遗忘梯度冲突，减少不平衡，平滑参数空间以减轻重新学习攻击。

Result: 在WMDP和MUSE数据集上的广泛实验表明，PRISM在多种攻击下优于现有最佳基线方法，同时在关键指标间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: PRISM通过双重空间平滑性有效解决了机器遗忘中的鲁棒性和指标平衡问题，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, Machine Unlearning has
emerged to address growing concerns around user privacy, copyright
infringement, and overall safety. Yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) unlearning
methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and metric imbalance, for
example by over-optimizing one objective (e.g., unlearning effectiveness,
utility preservation, or privacy protection) at the expense of others. In
addition, small perturbations in the representation or parameter space can be
exploited by relearn and jailbreak attacks. To address these challenges, we
propose PRISM, a unified framework that enforces dual-space smoothness in
representation and parameter spaces to improve robustness and balance
unlearning metrics. PRISM consists of two smoothness optimization stages: (i) a
representation space stage that employs a robustly trained probe to defend
against jailbreak attacks, and (ii) a parameter-space stage that decouples
retain-forget gradient conflicts, reduces imbalance, and smooths the parameter
space to mitigate relearning attacks. Extensive experiments on WMDP and MUSE,
across conversational-dialogue and continuous-text settings, show that PRISM
outperforms SOTA baselines under multiple attacks while achieving a better
balance among key metrics.

*Xinchun Su,Chunxu Luo,Yixuan Li,Weidong Yang,Lipeng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedCritical是一个两阶段框架，使用经过大模型微调的小模型进行自我对抗训练，通过提取长链思维模板和模型自学习DPO来提升小模型在医疗复杂推理任务中的表现，在降低成本的同时达到与传统知识蒸馏方法相当的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗领域，小语言模型在临床诊断、治疗计划等复杂推理任务中表现不佳，而传统基于知识蒸馏的方法使用LLM作为评判者存在成本高、效率低的问题。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段从教师模型提取高层次和详细的长链思维模板指导学生模型生成复杂推理思维；第二阶段通过模型自迭代协作引入直接偏好优化(DPO)，让微调后的模型在训练中对抗修正轨迹来增强学生模型的推理能力。

Result: MedCritical 7B模型在CMExam基准测试中分别比Taiyi和Huatuo-o1-7B模型高出3.04%和10.12%，在7B级小模型中实现了新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 模型自学习DPO方法能够让学生模型利用自身的错误驱动洞察来巩固技能和知识，以更低的成本解决复杂问题，达到与传统知识蒸馏方法相当的效果。

Abstract: In the field of medicine, complex reasoning tasks such as clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and medical knowledge integration pose significant
challenges, where small language models often underperform compared to large
language models like GPT-4 and Deepseek. Recent knowledge distillation-based
methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction,
but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and
efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework,
MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher
model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and
detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the
student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage,
we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration
collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing
against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This
model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own
error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex
problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation
methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model
outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\%
respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among
7B-class small models.

TL;DR: 提出MetaAPO框架，通过元学习动态耦合数据生成与模型训练，解决离线偏好数据与模型策略间的分布不匹配问题，在多个基准上优于现有方法并减少42%在线标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法在处理离线数据与动态模型策略间的分布不匹配时存在局限，无法适应模型的动态学习状态。

Method: 使用轻量级元学习器作为"对齐差距估计器"，评估在线采样的潜在收益，指导针对性在线生成并为优化目标分配样本级元权重，动态平衡在线和离线数据的质量与分布。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2、Arena-Hard和MT-Bench上的实验表明，MetaAPO在各种设置下始终优于现有偏好优化方法。

Conclusion: MetaAPO通过动态耦合数据生成与训练，有效解决了分布不匹配问题，在提升性能的同时显著降低了在线标注成本。

Abstract: Preference optimization is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values and intentions. A significant challenge in this process is
the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the
evolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static
heuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to
adapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose
Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework
that dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a
lightweight meta-learner, as an "alignment gap estimator", to evaluate the
potential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This
guides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the
optimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of
online and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench
demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference
optimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online
annotation costs.

TL;DR: 提出Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD)框架，通过双阶段对比机制减少放射学MLLM中的医学幻觉问题，无需训练或检索即可提升临床准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在放射学中经常产生临床无依据的描述（医学幻觉），这在需要精确性和图像基础输出的医疗应用中存在严重风险。

Method: 引入CCD框架，集成来自特定任务放射学专家模型的结构化临床信号，通过双阶段对比机制在生成过程中精炼token级logits。

Result: 在三个数据集和多个模型上的实验表明，CCD持续提升放射学报告生成性能，在MIMIC-CXR数据集上，应用于最先进的RRG模型时RadGraph-F1提升高达17%。

Conclusion: CCD提供了一个轻量级且可泛化的解决方案来缓解医学幻觉，有效连接放射学中的专家模型和MLLM。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language
understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported
descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in
medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through
empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent
in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To
address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free
and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical
signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage
contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby
enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on
three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves
overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR
dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to
state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and
generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively
bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防护模型在多语言扩展和模型移植方面存在局限，需要开发更高效、可扩展的安全防护方法，减少数据和计算需求。

Method: 使用Guard Vector参数差异向量，结合目标语言模型构建目标防护模型；采用流式感知方法，结合前缀训练和单标记输出的分类器设计。

Result: 在标准安全测试套件中提升分类质量，支持中文、日文、韩文的多语言扩展，无需额外训练或目标语言标签；在Llama和Gemma等主流模型上实现可移植性。

Conclusion: Guard Vector方法有效提升了安全防护的效率和可扩展性，支持多语言和跨模型部署，有助于构建更负责任的AI生态系统。

Abstract: We introduce Guard Vector, a safety task vector computed as the parameter
difference between a guardrail model (Guard Model) and a same-architecture
pretrained language model. Composing this vector with a target language model
yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware
approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier
that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves
classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety
suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean,
requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also
demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail
backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM
preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior
between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design
increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce
data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation
practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的计算成本很高，限制了受控实验的开展。为了克服这一限制，作者希望能在单次训练中同时进行多个实验，以降低计算成本。

Method: 在训练一个15亿参数模型的过程中同时进行十个实验，包括数据污染、投毒、记忆等已有研究的复现，以及知识获取、数学推理和水印等新研究。

Result: 实验表明，十个实验对模型训练动态和整体性能影响很小，不同实验之间的交互作用可以忽略不计。成功复现了多个先前工作的结果。

Conclusion: 在单次训练运行中同时进行多个预训练实验是可行的，这种方法可以在有限计算预算下实现对大型模型的严格科学实验。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that controlled pretraining experiments are a
powerful tool for understanding learning, reasoning, and memorization in large
language models (LLMs). However, the computational cost of pretraining presents
a significant constraint. To overcome this constraint, we propose to conduct
multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run.
We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by conducting ten experiments
during the training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens. Although we only
train a single model, we can replicate the results from multiple previous works
on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization. We also conduct novel
investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and
watermarking. For example, we dynamically update the training data until the
model acquires a particular piece of knowledge. Remarkably, the influence of
the ten experiments on the model's training dynamics and overall performance is
minimal. However, interactions between different experiments may act as a
potential confounder in our approach. We propose to test for interactions with
continual pretraining experiments, finding them to be negligible in our setup.
Overall, our findings suggest that performing multiple pretraining experiments
in a single training run can enable rigorous scientific experimentation with
large models on a compute budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动提示优化方法存在稳定性差、效率低、容易陷入局部最优的问题，需要更有效的优化策略。

Method: 提出GRACE框架，包含门控精炼策略（反馈调节门和更新拒绝门）和自适应压缩策略（提炼核心概念并重构优化轨迹）。

Result: 在11个任务上的实验显示，GRACE相比现有方法在BIG-Bench Hard、领域特定和通用NLP任务上分别实现了4.7%、4.4%和2.7%的相对性能提升，仅需25%的提示生成预算。

Conclusion: GRACE通过战略性地引入信息损失，在提示优化中实现了性能与效率的显著提升，为大规模语言模型的高效应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging the full potential of large
language models (LLMs). While automatic prompt optimization offers a scalable
alternative to costly manual design, generating effective prompts remains
challenging. Existing methods often struggle to stably generate improved
prompts, leading to low efficiency, and overlook that prompt optimization
easily gets trapped in local optima. Addressing this, we propose GRACE, a
framework that integrates two synergistic strategies: Gated Refinement and
Adaptive Compression, achieving Efficient prompt optimization. The gated
refinement strategy introduces a feedback regulation gate and an update
rejection gate, which refine update signals to produce stable and effective
prompt improvements. When optimization stagnates, the adaptive compression
strategy distills the prompt's core concepts, restructuring the optimization
trace and opening new paths. By strategically introducing information loss
through refinement and compression, GRACE delivers substantial gains in
performance and efficiency. In extensive experiments on 11 tasks across three
practical domains, including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), domain-specific, and general
NLP tasks, GRACE achieves significant average relative performance improvements
of 4.7%, 4.4% and 2.7% over state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Further
analysis shows that GRACE achieves these gains using only 25% of the prompt
generation budget required by prior methods, highlighting its high optimization
efficiency and low computational overhead. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决机器翻译中文化绑定术语的忠实传递问题，现有方法仅关注文本内解决方案，忽视了专业翻译人员使用的脚注和尾注等副文本工具。

Method: 基于Genette的副文本理论，构建了560个专家对齐的副文本数据集，评估了带和不带推理轨迹的LLM在显化选择和内容上的表现，使用了内在提示和代理检索方法。

Result: LLM生成的副文本能提高受众理解度，但效果仍远不如译者创作；统计分析显示专业译者在使用副文本方面存在很大差异，表明文化调解本质上是开放性的。

Conclusion: 副文本显化在推动机器翻译超越语言对等方面具有潜力，可扩展到单语解释和个性化适应等应用。

Abstract: The faithful transfer of contextually-embedded meaning continues to challenge
contemporary machine translation (MT), particularly in the rendering of
culture-bound terms--expressions or concepts rooted in specific languages or
cultures, resisting direct linguistic transfer. Existing computational
approaches to explicitating these terms have focused exclusively on in-text
solutions, overlooking paratextual apparatus in the footnotes and endnotes
employed by professional translators. In this paper, we formalize Genette's
(1987) theory of paratexts from literary and translation studies to introduce
the task of paratextual explicitation for MT. We construct a dataset of 560
expert-aligned paratexts from four English translations of the classical
Chinese short story collection Liaozhai and evaluate LLMs with and without
reasoning traces on choice and content of explicitation. Experiments across
intrinsic prompting and agentic retrieval methods establish the difficulty of
this task, with human evaluation showing that LLM-generated paratexts improve
audience comprehension, though remain considerably less effective than
translator-authored ones. Beyond model performance, statistical analysis
reveals that even professional translators vary widely in their use of
paratexts, suggesting that cultural mediation is inherently open-ended rather
than prescriptive. Our findings demonstrate the potential of paratextual
explicitation in advancing MT beyond linguistic equivalence, with promising
extensions to monolingual explanation and personalized adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的发展，其在自动评分中的应用日益广泛。由于LLM具有强大的推理能力，能够提供评分理由，因此评估人类和LLM评分员的理由有助于理解各自评分时的推理过程，识别评分不一致的潜在原因。

Method: 使用大规模测试的作文数据，基于二次加权kappa和归一化互信息评估GPT-4o、Gemini等LLM的评分准确性。使用余弦相似度评估理由的相似性，并通过主成分分析基于理由嵌入探索理由的聚类模式。

Result: 研究发现揭示了LLM在自动评分中的准确性和"思考"方式，提供了对评分理由的深入理解。

Conclusion: 本研究为理解人类评分和基于LLM的自动评分背后的理由提供了重要见解，有助于改进自动评分系统的开发和应用。

Abstract: Advances in automated scoring are closely aligned with advances in
machine-learning and natural-language-processing techniques. With recent
progress in large language models (LLMs), the use of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude,
and other generative-AI chatbots for automated scoring has been explored. Given
their strong reasoning capabilities, LLMs can also produce rationales to
support the scores they assign. Thus, evaluating the rationales provided by
both human and LLM raters can help improve the understanding of the reasoning
that each type of rater applies when assigning a score. This study investigates
the rationales of human and LLM raters to identify potential causes of scoring
inconsistency. Using essays from a large-scale test, the scoring accuracy of
GPT-4o, Gemini, and other LLMs is examined based on quadratic weighted kappa
and normalized mutual information. Cosine similarity is used to evaluate the
similarity of the rationales provided. In addition, clustering patterns in
rationales are explored using principal component analysis based on the
embeddings of the rationales. The findings of this study provide insights into
the accuracy and ``thinking'' of LLMs in automated scoring, helping to improve
the understanding of the rationales behind both human scoring and LLM-based
automated scoring.

Motivation: 现有评估方法过于严格，导致语言模型的正确回答因表面形式不同而被误判为错误，从而低估了模型的参数知识。

Method: 提出检索约束解码(RCD)策略，限制模型输出为唯一的表面形式，并使用YAGO-QA数据集(19,137个常识问题)进行验证。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-70B模型上，标准解码F1得分为32.3%，而RCD提升至46.0%；Llama-3.1-8B使用RCD达到33.0%，甚至超过了更大模型的标准解码表现。

Conclusion: RCD方法能更准确地评估语言模型的真实知识水平，揭示了现有评估方法对模型能力的低估问题。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, but often produce
answers judged as incorrect. We hypothesize that many of these answers are
actually correct, but are expressed in alternative surface forms that are
dismissed due to an overly strict evaluation, leading to an underestimation of
models' parametric knowledge. We propose Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD),
a decoding strategy that restricts model outputs to unique surface forms. We
introduce YAGO-QA, a dataset of 19,137 general knowledge questions. Evaluating
open-source LMs from 135M to 70B parameters, we show that standard decoding
undervalues their knowledge. For instance, Llama-3.1-70B scores only 32.3% F1
with vanilla decoding but 46.0% with RCD. Similarly, Llama-3.1-8B reaches 33.0%
with RCD, outperforming the larger model under vanilla decoding. We publicly

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型家族上的广泛实验证实，CooT持续提升安全性和社交推理性能。

Conclusion: CooT将对齐从固定属性转变为显式、动态、可审计的推理过程，支持灵活策略更新而无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but can still exhibit
harmful behaviors. Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into
model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify.
This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time
framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop.
CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that
continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured,
precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to
detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT
intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and
regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with
context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property
into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference,
allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT
consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

Abstract: Item difficulty plays a crucial role in test performance, interpretability of
scores, and equity for all test-takers, especially in large-scale assessments.
Traditional approaches to item difficulty modeling rely on field testing and
classical test theory (CTT)-based item analysis or item response theory (IRT)
calibration, which can be time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, text-based approaches leveraging machine learning and language
models, have emerged as promising alternatives. This paper reviews and
synthesizes 37 articles on automated item difficulty prediction in large-scale
assessment settings published through May 2025. For each study, we delineate
the dataset, difficulty parameter, subject domain, item type, number of items,
training and test data split, input, features, model, evaluation criteria, and
model performance outcomes. Results showed that although classic machine
learning models remain relevant due to their interpretability, state-of-the-art
language models, using both small and large transformer-based architectures,
can capture syntactic and semantic patterns without the need for manual feature
engineering. Uniquely, model performance outcomes were summarized to serve as a
benchmark for future research and overall, text-based methods have the
potential to predict item difficulty with root mean square error (RMSE) as low
as 0.165, Pearson correlation as high as 0.87, and accuracy as high as 0.806.
The review concludes by discussing implications for practice and outlining
future research directions for automated item difficulty modeling.

predictions based on prompts without additional fine-tuning. While prompt
engineering has been widely studied, the impact of role design within prompts
remains underexplored. This study examines the influence of role configurations
in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o from
OpenAI and Llama2-7b and Llama2-13b from Meta. We evaluate the models'
performance across datasets, focusing on tasks like sentiment analysis, text
classification, question answering, and math reasoning. Our findings suggest
the potential of role-based prompt structuring to enhance LLM performance.

Abstract: This paper describes AraS2P, our speech-to-phonemes system submitted to the
Iqra'Eval 2025 Shared Task. We adapted Wav2Vec2-BERT via Two-Stage training
strategy. In the first stage, task-adaptive continue pretraining was performed
on large-scale Arabic speech-phonemes datasets, which were generated by
converting the Arabic text using the MSA Phonetiser. In the second stage, the
model was fine-tuned on the official shared task data, with additional
augmentation from XTTS-v2-synthesized recitations featuring varied Ayat
segments, speaker embeddings, and textual perturbations to simulate possible
human errors. The system ranked first on the official leaderboard,
demonstrating that phoneme-aware pretraining combined with targeted
augmentation yields strong performance in phoneme-level mispronunciation
detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于主动学习的阿拉伯语情感分析框架，使用LLM辅助标注减少人工标注成本，在三个基准数据集上验证了LLM标注与人工标注的竞争力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语情感分析因缺乏大规模高质量标注数据集而进展缓慢，主动学习在其他语言中已证明能减少标注成本，但在阿拉伯语中研究较少，LLM在阿拉伯语标注中的应用也未被充分探索

Method: 提出主动学习框架，评估LSTM、GRU、RNN等深度学习架构在三个阿拉伯语数据集上的表现，比较人工标注与LLM辅助标注两种策略，评估了GPT-4o、Claude 3 Sonnet等五种LLM作为标注器

Result: LLM辅助的主动学习在性能上可与人工标注竞争甚至更优。在Hunger Station数据集上，LSTM模型使用GPT-4o标注仅需450个样本即达93%准确率；在MASAC数据集上，DeepSeek Chat使用650个样本达到82%准确率，与人工标注相当

Conclusion: LLM辅助的主动学习是阿拉伯语情感分析的有效方法，能显著减少标注成本同时保持高性能，为资源有限的语言提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, plays a
vital role in areas like marketing, customer service, and social media
monitoring by providing insights into user opinions and emotions. However,
progress in Arabic sentiment analysis remains limited due to the lack of large,
high-quality labeled datasets. While active learning has proven effective in
reducing annotation efforts in other languages, few studies have explored it in
Arabic sentiment tasks. Likewise, the use of large language models (LLMs) for
assisting annotation and comparing their performance to human labeling is still
largely unexplored in the Arabic context. In this paper, we propose an active
learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis designed to reduce annotation
costs while maintaining high performance. We evaluate multiple deep learning
architectures: Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent
units (GRU), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), across three benchmark
datasets: Hunger Station, AJGT, and MASAC, encompassing both modern standard
Arabic and dialectal variations. Additionally, two annotation strategies are
compared: Human labeling and LLM-assisted labeling. Five LLMs are evaluated as
annotators: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, and LLaMA 3
70B Instruct. For each dataset, the best-performing LLM was used: GPT-4o for
Hunger Station, Claude 3 Sonnet for AJGT, and DeepSeek Chat for MASAC. Our
results show that LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to human labeling. For example, on the Hunger Station
dataset, the LSTM model achieved 93% accuracy with only 450 labeled samples
using GPT-4o-generated labels, while on the MASAC dataset, DeepSeek Chat
reached 82% accuracy with 650 labeled samples, matching the accuracy obtained
through human labeling.

TL;DR: 本文研究了微调LLM作为评判员在实际部署中的三个关键问题：未来兼容性、向后兼容性和问题泛化能力，发现在数学领域中未来兼容性最具挑战性，而向后兼容性相对容易实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前微调评判员的方法虽然性能优于直接提示前沿模型，但标准评估忽略了实际部署中的关键问题，包括评判员对未来模型、过去模型响应的适应性以及对未见问题的泛化能力。

Method: 在数学领域建立统一框架，使用不同的训练和测试分布，比较三种基于SFT和DPO的微调算法以及三种不同的基础模型，系统研究评判员的未来兼容性、向后兼容性和问题泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明：未来兼容性对大多数模型具有挑战性；向后兼容性相对容易，DPO训练的模型能持续提升性能；持续学习比仅在强或弱响应上训练能更好地适应新旧响应分布的变化；所有模型在从训练中见过的问题转移到未见问题时都出现性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前评判员模型无法完全泛化到未见问题，研究结果为在不断变化的生成器环境中开发和部署评判员模型提供了实践指导，建议采用持续学习策略来平衡适应不同响应分布。

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is widely used in both evaluating free-text model
responses and reward modeling for model alignment and finetuning. Recently,
finetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred
choice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former
achieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to
common biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical
concerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this
paper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of
these judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges
finetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by
future models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well
judges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three
aspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and
test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three
different base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging
for most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with
DPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that
continual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older
and newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker
responses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance
degradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones,
showing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions. These
findings provide insights into practical considerations for developing and
deploying judge models in the face of ever-changing generators.

professionals by reducing the overload of manual documentation and improving
workflow efficiency. Towards this goal, we develop a system that combines
automatic speech recognition techniques with text correction model, allowing
better handling of domain-specific terminology and linguistic variations in
Greek. Our approach leverages both acoustic and textual modeling to create more

and speech technologies to the Greek medical context, addressing challenges
such as complex medical terminology and linguistic inconsistencies. Through
domain-specific fine-tuning, our system achieves more accurate and coherent
transcriptions, contributing to the development of practical language
technologies for the Greek healthcare sector.

Motivation: 现有CoT蒸馏方法低估了推理链质量的重要性，过度关注数据量，可能将噪声或错误信息传递给学生模型。

Method: 提出模型导向的推理链选择蒸馏(MoRSD)，能够识别并选择高质量推理链进行蒸馏。还提出了Rationale Difficulty指标来衡量学生模型在给定推理链下生成正确答案的能力。

Result: 在三个任务的七个数据集上平均提升4.6%，通过控制推理链的准确性、多样性和难度，使用更少的推理链获得更好的效果。

Conclusion: 小部分高质量推理链比整个数据集更能提升学生模型的推理能力，该方法为高效CoT蒸馏提供了可能的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation aims to enhance small language models'
(SLMs) reasoning by transferring multi-step reasoning capability from the
larger teacher models. However, existing work underestimates rationale quality,
focusing primarily on data quantity, which may transfer noisy or incorrect
information to the student model. To address the above issues, we proposed
\textbf{M}odel-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}ationale \textbf{S}election
\textbf{D}istillation (MoRSD), which can discern and select high quality
rationales for distillation to improve performance further. We further propose
a Rationale Difficulty (RD) metric to measure the ability of the student model
to generate the correct answer under a given rationale. Compared to the
baseline, we achieved 4.6$\%$ average improvement on seven datasets over three
tasks, using fewer rationales by controlling their accuracy, diversity, and
difficulty. Our results reveal that a small portion of the high quality
rationales can enhance the reasoning ability of student models than the entire
dataset. Our method promises to be a possible solution for efficient CoT
distillation. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MoRSD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Jackal，一个包含10万对自然语言查询到JQL查询的大规模文本到JQL基准测试，包含执行结果验证，并评估了23个LLM模型在JQL生成任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏开放、真实世界、基于执行的将自然语言查询映射到JQL的基准测试，企业团队依赖JQL从Jira中检索和筛选问题。

Method: 创建Jackal基准测试，包含10万对自然语言请求与已验证的JQL查询，在包含20万个问题的实时Jira实例上进行执行验证。每个JQL查询关联四种用户请求类型：长自然语言、短自然语言、语义相似和语义精确。

Result: 在Jackal-5K子集上，最佳模型(Gemini 2.5 Pro)在四种用户请求类型上的平均执行准确率仅为60.3%。性能在不同请求类型间差异显著：长自然语言(86.0%)、短自然语言(35.7%)、语义相似(22.7%)、语义精确(99.3%)。

Conclusion: Jackal暴露了当前最先进LLM在生成正确且可执行JQL查询方面的局限性，为Jira企业数据的未来研究设定了新的基于执行的挑战。

Abstract: Enterprise teams rely on the Jira Query Language (JQL) to retrieve and filter
issues from Jira. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no open, real-world,
execution-based benchmark for mapping natural language queries to JQL. We
introduce Jackal, a novel, large-scale text-to-JQL benchmark comprising 100,000
natural language (NL) requests paired with validated JQL queries and
execution-based results on a live Jira instance with over 200,000 issues. To
reflect real-world usage, each JQL query is associated with four types of user
requests: (i) Long NL, (ii) Short NL, (iii) Semantically Similar, and (iv)
Semantically Exact. We release Jackal, a corpus of 100,000 text-to-JQL pairs,
together with an execution-based scoring toolkit, and a static snapshot of the
evaluated Jira instance for reproducibility. We report text-to-JQL results on
23 Large Language Models (LLMs) spanning parameter sizes, open and closed
source models, across execution accuracy, exact match, and canonical exact
match. In this paper, we report results on Jackal-5K, a 5,000-pair subset of
Jackal. On Jackal-5K, the best overall model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieves only
60.3% execution accuracy averaged equally across four user request types.
Performance varies significantly across user request types: (i) Long NL
(86.0%), (ii) Short NL (35.7%), (iii) Semantically Similar (22.7%), and (iv)
Semantically Exact (99.3%). By benchmarking LLMs on their ability to produce
correct and executable JQL queries, Jackal exposes the limitations of current
state-of-the-art LLMs and sets a new, execution-based challenge for future
research in Jira enterprise data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流幻觉检测方法依赖事实一致性验证或静态隐藏层特征，前者受限于知识覆盖范围，后者难以捕捉推理过程中的偏差。受认知神经科学信号分析方法的启发，需要开发能够有效检测推理过程中异常的新方法。

Method: 将LLM推理过程视为随时间展开的认知旅程，通过隐藏层时序信号建模人类信号感知和辨别过程；应用快速傅里叶变换将时序信号映射到频域构建频谱特征；基于这些频谱特征设计幻觉检测算法。

Result: 频谱特征分析实验证明了该方法的有效性，HSAD方法在检测准确性和鲁棒性方面表现出更高的性能。

Conclusion: HSAD方法通过有效结合推理过程建模和频域特征提取，克服了现有方法在知识覆盖和推理偏差检测方面的限制，为LLM幻觉检测提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a
wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the
frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become
a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios.
Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency
verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the
scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning
biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by
signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a
hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden
layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal
\textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's
reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose
modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and
discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal
signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal
signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are
used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis
experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this
approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on
these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By
effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with
frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations
of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of
reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: Timber是一种无需训练的方法，通过部分恢复Instruct模型到Base模型的权重差异，在保持利用能力的同时增强探索能力，显著提升Pass@k性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练通常被认为是表面的，虽然提高了利用能力但限制了探索能力，存在关键权衡问题。

Method: 提出Timber方法，通过细微但有针对性的权重增量调整，将Instruct模型部分恢复到配对的Base模型状态。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen系列上的大量实验表明，Timber能持续改进普通Instruct模型，特别是在Pass@k性能上。

Conclusion: 研究从权重层面为后训练阶段提供了新见解，并为无需训练精炼Instruct模型提供了实用策略。

Abstract: Post-training, which elicits a pretrained Base model into the corresponding
Instruct model, is widely considered to be superficial. In this work, we first
reinforce this hypothesis by providing novel quantitative evidence from the
weight level that the effective rank (eRank) remains negligibly changed.
However, this superficiality also suffers a critical trade-off, improving the
exploitation capabilities at the cost of limiting its exploration. To tackle
this issue, we propose Timber, a simple yet effective training-free method that
enhances the exploration capability of the Instruct model while preserving its
exploitation. The key insight is to partially revert Instruct towards the
paired Base model by subtle yet targeted refinement of the weight deltas.
Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series demonstrate that Timber
consistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly on Pass@k
performance. Our findings offer new insights into the post-training stage at
the weight level and practical strategies to refine the Instruct model without
training.

Motivation: 现有面向推理的大语言模型依赖显式token生成，需要大规模监督微调或强化学习，而Chain-of-Thought技术虽然提升性能但效率低下，推理轨迹长导致延迟和token使用量增加。

Method: 使用简化的CoT草图训练学习离散策略先验码本，推理时通过少量连续思考向量实现策略级指导；提出GainRouter轻量级路由机制，自适应切换快速码本引导推理和慢速显式推理。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，该方法实现了竞争性或更优的准确性，同时显著降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: 为大型语言模型提供了一条实现高效可控推理的实用路径。

Abstract: Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on generating
explicit tokens step by step, and their effectiveness typically hinges on
large-scale supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques substantially enhance performance on complex
reasoning tasks, they remain inefficient, requiring long reasoning traces that
increase latency and token usage. In this work, we introduce Latent Codebooks
for Fast Thinking, a framework that uses concise CoT sketches only during
training to learn a codebook of discrete strategy priors. At inference, the
model conditions on a handful of continuous thinking vectors distilled from the
codebook in a single pass, enabling strategy-level guidance without producing
explicit reasoning tokens. To complement this design, we propose GainRouter, a
lightweight routing mechanism that adaptively switches between fast codebook
guided inference and slow explicit reasoning, thereby suppressing overthinking
and reducing unnecessary token generation. Experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while substantially lowering inference cost, offering a practical path
toward efficient and controllable reasoning in large language models.

Motivation: 现有的基于掩码的扩散语言模型难以修正错误的标记，一旦生成就会固定不变。主要挑战在于识别输入中的潜在错误。

Method: RemeDi联合预测标记分布和每个标记的置信度分数，基于置信度决定哪些标记需要重新掩码。设计了包含监督微调和强化学习的训练流程，教导模型检测和重新掩码错误标记。

Result: 实验表明，RemeDi在多个数据集上达到了开源扩散语言模型中的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 重新掩码机制使扩散语言模型能够更灵活地优化文本生成，通过识别和修正低质量标记来提升生成质量。

Abstract: Mask-based Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) struggle to revise incorrect
tokens: once a token is generated, it typically remains fixed. The key
challenge is to identify potential errors in the inputs. In this paper, we
propose \emph{\underline{Rem}asking-\underline{e}nabled \underline{Di}ffusion
Language Model (RemeDi}, a mask-based DLM that introduces \emph{remasking} as
another fundamental mechanism, enabling more flexible text refinement in
diffusion-based text generation. To achieve this, RemeDi jointly predicts token
distributions and per-token confidence scores at each step. The confidence
scores determine which tokens to be unmasked after the current step, allowing
the model to identify tokens with low quality and remask them. These remasked
tokens can be resampled with richer context in subsequent steps. We design a
remask-aware pipeline to train this ability, including supervised fine-tuning
which teaches the model to detect and remask incorrect tokens in addition to
predict mask tokens, and reinforcement learning which optimizes full generation
trajectories toward higher rewards. Experiments show that RemeDi achieves the
state-of-the-art results among open-source DLMs on multiple datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习在提升复杂推理能力方面表现出色，但其在跨语言泛化方面与监督微调的比较尚未被探索，因此需要系统研究这两种方法在跨语言推理任务上的表现差异。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-3B-Base作为基础模型，在多种多语言推理基准测试（包括数学推理、常识推理和科学推理）上进行实验，并对RL和SFT进行机制分析。

Result: RL不仅获得更高准确率，而且跨语言泛化能力显著强于SFT；在非英语数据上进行RL训练比英语数据训练效果更好，而SFT没有这种优势。

Conclusion: RL使模型具备更鲁棒的推理策略，为更公平有效的多语言推理提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
attracts widespread attention. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
superior performance for improving complex reasoning, its impact on
cross-lingual generalization compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) remains
unexplored. We present the first systematic investigation into cross-lingual
reasoning generalization of RL and SFT. Using Qwen2.5-3B-Base as our foundation
model, we conduct experiments on diverse multilingual reasoning benchmarks,
including math reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and scientific reasoning. Our
investigation yields two significant findings: (1) Tuning with RL not only
achieves higher accuracy but also demonstrates substantially stronger
cross-lingual generalization capabilities compared to SFT. (2) RL training on
non-English data yields better overall performance and generalization than
training on English data, which is not observed with SFT. Furthermore, through
comprehensive mechanistic analyses, we explore the underlying factors of RL's
superiority and generalization across languages. Our results provide compelling
evidence that RL enables the model with more robust reasoning strategies,
offering crucial guidance for more equitable and effective multilingual
reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法简单易实现、可扩展，能与现有LLM训练和部署流程无缝集成，为行业提供更稳健和公平的多语言AI解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain unreliable for global enterprise
applications due to substantial performance gaps between high-resource and
mid/low-resource languages, driven by English-centric pretraining and internal
reasoning biases. This inconsistency undermines customer experience and
operational reliability in multilingual settings such as customer support,
content moderation, and information retrieval. Even with advanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, we observe up to an 29% accuracy
drop in non-English languages compared to English.
  We propose a practical, batch-wise alignment strategy for fine-tuning LLMs,
leveraging semantically equivalent multilingual data in each training batch to
directly align model outputs across languages. This approach improves
non-English accuracy by up to 23.9\% without compromising English performance,
model reasoning, or retrieval quality. Our method is simple to implement,
scalable, and integrates seamlessly with existing LLM training \& deployment

TL;DR: TF-Bench是一个基于System F类型推断的基准测试，用于评估LLM的程序语义推理能力，通过去除语义无关的自然语言构建纯语义版本TF-Bench_pure，发现当前最先进LLM在该任务上表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码推理基准缺乏形式化的程序中心演绎框架，无法评估模型是否真正理解程序语义还是仅利用自然语言和代码标记的表面关联。

Method: 使用System F类型推断作为程序语义推理任务，通过验证转换去除语义无关的自然语言构建TF-Bench_pure，并提出两个新指标评估鲁棒性和测试时推理效果。

Result: 最先进的LLM(Claude-3.7-sonnet)在TF-Bench_pure上仅达到55.85%的准确率，显示出当前LLM在程序语义推理方面的重大局限性。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在程序语义推理能力上存在关键限制，需要未来研究重点关注和改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software
engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities
show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond
mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a
formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are
incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics
or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code
tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to
as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove
semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely
semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial
limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM
(Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure.
Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the
effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估多模态大语言模型在复杂人类中心环境中进行细微推理和决策的能力仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 开发VIVA+基准测试，包含三个核心能力维度：基础情境理解、上下文驱动的行动推理和反思性推理，并评估最新商业和开源模型。

Result: 评估揭示了不同的性能模式，并突显了显著挑战。针对性训练和多步推理策略带来了一致的性能改进。

Conclusion: 深入分析揭示了当前模型的局限性，并为推进多模态大语言模型在现实世界环境中实现更稳健、上下文感知和社交熟练的决策提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results for embodied
agents in operating meaningfully in complex, human-centered environments. Yet,
evaluating their capacity for nuanced, human-like reasoning and decision-making
remains challenging. In this work, we introduce VIVA+, a cognitively grounded
benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and decision-making of MLLMs in
human-centered situations. VIVA+ consists of 1,317 real-world situations paired
with 6,373 multiple-choice questions, targeting three core abilities for
decision-making: (1) Foundational Situation Comprehension, (2) Context-Driven
Action Justification, and (3) Reflective Reasoning. Together, these dimensions
provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to perceive,
reason, and act in socially meaningful ways. We evaluate the latest commercial
and open-source models on VIVA+, where we reveal distinct performance patterns
and highlight significant challenges. We further explore targeted training and
multi-step reasoning strategies, which yield consistent performance
improvements. Finally, our in-depth analysis highlights current model
limitations and provides actionable insights for advancing MLLMs toward more
robust, context-aware, and socially adept decision-making in real-world
settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出M-Hyper方法解决多模态知识图谱补全问题，通过四元数代数实现融合模态和独立模态表示的共存与协作，克服了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKGC方法存在两种范式：融合方法会丢失模态特定信息且缺乏灵活性；集成方法难以捕捉模态间的语义交互。需要克服这两种方法的双重限制。

Method: 使用四元数代数，利用其四个正交基表示独立模态，通过Hamilton积建模模态间交互。包含细粒度实体表示分解模块和鲁棒关系感知模态融合模块。

Result: 在广泛实验中表现出最先进的性能、鲁棒性和计算效率。

Conclusion: M-Hyper方法成功实现了融合和独立模态表示的共存与协作，在多模态知识图谱补全任务中取得了优异效果。

Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover missing facts
in multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging both structural
relationships and diverse modality information of entities. Existing MMKGC
methods follow two multi-modal paradigms: fusion-based and ensemble-based.
Fusion-based methods employ fixed fusion strategies, which inevitably leads to
the loss of modality-specific information and a lack of flexibility to adapt to
varying modality relevance across contexts. In contrast, ensemble-based methods
retain modality independence through dedicated sub-models but struggle to
capture the nuanced, context-dependent semantic interplay between modalities.
To overcome these dual limitations, we propose a novel MMKGC method M-Hyper,
which achieves the coexistence and collaboration of fused and independent
modality representations. Our method integrates the strengths of both
paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal interactions while maintaining
modality-specific information. Inspired by ``quaternion'' algebra, we utilize
its four orthogonal bases to represent multiple independent modalities and
employ the Hamilton product to efficiently model pair-wise interactions among
them. Specifically, we introduce a Fine-grained Entity Representation
Factorization (FERF) module and a Robust Relation-aware Modality Fusion (R2MF)
module to obtain robust representations for three independent modalities and
one fused modality. The resulting four modality representations are then mapped
to the four orthogonal bases of a biquaternion (a hypercomplex extension of
quaternion) for comprehensive modality interaction. Extensive experiments
indicate its state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and computational
efficiency.

Abstract: Ensuring that both new and experienced drivers master current traffic rules
is critical to road safety. This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs)
on Romanian driving-law QA with explanation generation. We release a
1{,}208-question dataset (387 multimodal) and compare text-only and multimodal
SOTA systems, then measure the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning for Llama
3.1-8B-Instruct and RoLlama 3.1-8B-Instruct. SOTA models perform well, but
fine-tuned 8B models are competitive. Textual descriptions of images outperform
direct visual input. Finally, an LLM-as-a-Judge assesses explanation quality,
revealing self-preference bias. The study informs explainable QA for
less-resourced languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在逻辑推理中面临整合瓶颈，而非感知瓶颈。研究发现只有当多模态提供独立且充分的推理路径时才能提升性能，而冗余或链式推理支持往往会损害性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理研究存在矛盾结果，缺乏受控评估框架和内部机制分析来理解模态交互何时支持或损害推理。

Method: 使用基于逻辑的评估框架，将多模态推理分为六种交互模式，分析事实在不同模态间的分布和逻辑组合方式。通过注意力模式分析和两步提示策略进行验证。

Result: 额外模态仅在提供独立充分推理路径时增强推理；推理性能在三种方式下退化：弱模态拖累整体性能、冲突导致模态偏好、多模态信号整合失败。识别出任务组合瓶颈和融合瓶颈两个核心问题。

Conclusion: 多模态推理的主要障碍是整合而非感知，建议采用组合感知训练和早期融合控制作为有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise enhanced reasoning by
integrating diverse inputs such as text, vision, and audio. Yet cross-modal
reasoning remains underexplored, with conflicting reports on whether added
modalities help or harm performance. These inconsistencies stem from a lack of
controlled evaluation frameworks and analysis of models' internals to isolate
when and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning. We address
this gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes
multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are
distributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional
modalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient
reasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts
performance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker
modalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward
certain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be
integrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures:
task-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly
executed in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces
bias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode
fact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason)
restores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck. Moreover,
modality identity remains recoverable in early layers, and softening attention
in early fusion improves reasoning, highlighting biased fusion as another
failure mode. Overall, our findings show that integration, not perception, is
the main barrier to multimodal reasoning, suggesting composition-aware training
and early fusion control as promising directions.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了语音集成到LLMs中导致文本能力下降的问题，提出了基于参数重要性估计的分析框架，发现微调会扰乱文本推理的关键参数分布，并通过层学习率调度和LoRA方法有效缓解此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音集成到大型语言模型中虽然扩展了其能力，但往往以削弱核心文本能力为代价，限制了语音增强LLMs充分利用其预训练文本知识的能力。

Method: 提出基于参数重要性估计的分析框架，研究编码器-适配器范式，采用层学习率调度和低秩适应(LoRA)两种缓解策略来保持原始参数分布。

Result: 实验结果显示，两种方法都比完全微调更好地保持了文本能力，同时提高了下游口语问答性能。

Conclusion: 分析为所提出的缓解策略有效性提供了原则性解释，将其优势与LLMs中文本知识的结构特性联系起来。

Abstract: The integration of speech into Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially
expanded their capabilities, but often at the cost of weakening their core
textual competence. This degradation limits the ability of speech-enabled LLMs
to fully exploit their pre-trained text-based knowledge. In this work, we
analyze the underlying mechanisms of this issue through a focused study of the
widely used encoder-adaptor paradigm. We propose an analytical framework based
on parameter importance estimation, which reveals that fine-tuning for speech
introduces a textual importance distribution shift: the layer-wise allocation
of parameters critical to textual reasoning is disrupted. Building on this
insight, we investigate two mitigation strategies: layer-wise learning rate
scheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), both aim to preserve the original
parameter distribution. Experimental results show that both approaches better
maintain textual competence than full fine-tuning, while also improving
downstream spoken question answering performance. Furthermore, our analysis
offers a principled explanation for the effectiveness of the proposed
mitigation strategies, linking their benefits to the structural properties of
textual knowledge in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了KLCF框架，通过知识一致性强化学习解决LLM长文本生成中的幻觉问题，无需外部知识，提升事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF框架主要依赖偏好奖励，但忽视了模型内部知识边界，加剧了'幻觉税'问题，需要解决长文本生成中的事实性缺陷。

Method: KLCF框架关注策略模型表达知识与基础模型参数知识的一致性，引入双事实对齐机制，利用预训练知识边界构建事实清单指导在线强化学习，同时训练基于基础模型内部知识的自评估模块。

Result: 实验结果显示KLCF在多个长文本基准测试中显著改善事实性指标，有效缓解模型幻觉问题。

Conclusion: KLCF提供了一种无需外部知识、轻量级的事实性优化方法，可高效扩展到大规模训练，为LLM可靠性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability
of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference
rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries,
exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we
propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a
novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy
model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and
introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall
and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to
construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve
factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module
based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision
during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or
heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and
lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training.
Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality
metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model
hallucinations.

TL;DR: 提出LoGo框架解决LLM个性化中的冷启动和偏见问题，通过结合个性化本地记忆和集体全局记忆来建模用户间的集体知识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM个性化中的两大挑战：冷启动问题（用户历史数据不足）和偏见问题（用户历史数据丰富但偏斜），两者都源于无法建模用户间的集体知识

Method: 提出本地-全局记忆框架(LoGo)，结合个性化本地记忆和捕获群体共享兴趣的集体全局记忆，并引入调解器模块来解决两种记忆源之间的冲突

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LoGo能持续提升个性化质量，既能预热冷启动用户，又能减轻偏见预测

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了融入集体知识对于增强LLM个性化的重要性

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to tailor model behavior to
individual users based on their historical interactions. However, its
effectiveness is often hindered by two key challenges: the \textit{cold-start
problem}, where users with limited history provide insufficient context for
accurate personalization, and the \textit{biasing problem}, where users with
abundant but skewed history cause the model to overfit to narrow preferences.
We identify both issues as symptoms of a common underlying limitation, i.e.,
the inability to model collective knowledge across users. To address this, we
propose a local-global memory framework (LoGo) that combines the personalized
local memory with a collective global memory that captures shared interests
across the population. To reconcile discrepancies between these two memory
sources, we introduce a mediator module designed to resolve conflicts between
local and global signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LoGo consistently improves personalization quality by both
warming up cold-start users and mitigating biased predictions. These results
highlight the importance of incorporating collective knowledge to enhance LLM
personalization.

TL;DR: 论文提出KAPPA方法，通过投影调整对齐知识基和预测基来解决LLMs在选择题中的知识-预测差距问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在其他场景中表现出正确知识，但在选择题上经常失败，存在知识-预测差距，需要研究其机制并缓解这一问题

Method: 通过探测分析发现残差流中存在知识基和预测基两个重要基向量，提出KAPPA方法——基于投影调整的无参数干预，将隐藏状态转换以对齐预测坐标与知识坐标

Result: 在Big-Bench-Hard和ARC-Challenge的二选一重构任务中，KAPPA显著提高准确率并持续优于基线方法，还能扩展到非选择题的自由形式问题

Conclusion: 研究提供了对知识-预测差距的新几何理解，并提供了使模型行为与其潜在知识更好对齐的实用方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
despite demonstrating correct knowledge in other contexts, such as free-form
generation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this knowledge-prediction
gap on MCQs and alleviate it, we conduct a probing analysis and find that
residual streams in certain layers contain a subspace spanned by two important
bases: a \emph{knowledge basis} that encodes the probability of the
ground-truth answer for a given MCQ and a \emph{prediction basis} that encodes
the probability of the answer choice predicted by the model. We observe that
incorrect predictions arise from a misalignment of the model's hidden states
along these two bases. Hence, we introduce \textbf{KAPPA} (Knowledge-Aligned
Prediction through Projection-based Adjustment), a parameter-free intervention
that transforms the hidden states to align the prediction coordinate with the
knowledge coordinate within this subspace. Experiments on binary-choice
reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge show that KAPPA
substantially improves accuracy and consistently outperforms baselines. While
optimal subspaces differ across tasks, subspaces generalize to some extent, as
supported by cross-dataset experiments. Moreover, KAPPA extends its
effectiveness to free-form questions beyond MCQs. Our work provides a new
geometric understanding of the knowledge-prediction gap and offers a practical
method for better aligning model behavior with its latent knowledge.

cross-encoder reranking for precise content retrieval. We evaluate our approach
on both subtasks using two LLMs, Fanar and Mistral, demonstrating that the
proposed RAG pipeline enhances performance across both, with accuracy
improvements up to 25%, depending on the task and model configuration. Our best
configuration is achieved with Fanar, yielding accuracy scores of 45% in
Subtask 1 and 80% in Subtask 2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见缓解方法主要针对预定义类别，无法处理新颖或上下文特定的新兴偏见，需要开发能够检测和缓解开放集偏见的方法。

Method: 提出Open-DeBias方法，使用适配器模块进行数据高效和参数高效的偏见缓解，能够缓解现有社会偏见和刻板印象偏见，并泛化到未见过的偏见类别。

Result: 在BBQ数据集上，Open-DeBias在模糊子集上的问答准确率比BMBI方法提高近48%，在消歧子集上提高6%；在零样本迁移到韩语BBQ时达到84%准确率，展现了强大的语言无关泛化能力。

Conclusion: Open-DeBias方法在广泛的NLP任务中表现出鲁棒性、多语言优势和适用于通用开放域偏见缓解的适用性，为LLM偏见缓解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on question
answering (QA) tasks, yet they often encode harmful biases that compromise
fairness and trustworthiness. Most existing bias mitigation approaches are
restricted to predefined categories, limiting their ability to address novel or
context-specific emergent biases. To bridge this gap, we tackle the novel
problem of open-set bias detection and mitigation in text-based QA. We
introduce OpenBiasBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate biases
across a wide range of categories and subgroups, encompassing both known and
previously unseen biases. Additionally, we propose Open-DeBias, a novel,
data-efficient, and parameter-efficient debiasing method that leverages adapter
modules to mitigate existing social and stereotypical biases while generalizing
to unseen ones. Compared to the state-of-the-art BMBI method, Open-DeBias
improves QA accuracy on BBQ dataset by nearly $48\%$ on ambiguous subsets and
$6\%$ on disambiguated ones, using adapters fine-tuned on just a small fraction
of the training data. Remarkably, the same adapters, in a zero-shot transfer to
Korean BBQ, achieve $84\%$ accuracy, demonstrating robust language-agnostic
generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we also validate the
effectiveness of Open-DeBias across a broad range of NLP tasks, including
StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs, highlighting its robustness, multilingual strength,
and suitability for general-purpose, open-domain bias mitigation. The project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文推理在大型语言模型中进展缓慢，主要由于处理长文本的内在困难以及缺乏可靠的人工标注和可验证的奖励信号。

Method: SPELL框架包含三个循环角色：问题生成器从原始文档生成问题，回答器学习基于文档回答问题，验证器评估回答与参考答案的语义等价性以产生奖励信号。采用自动化课程逐步增加文档长度，并调整问题难度以适应模型能力。

Result: 在六个长上下文基准测试中，SPELL持续提升不同LLM的性能，优于同等规模的大规模标注数据微调模型。在Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking上平均获得7.6分的pass@8提升。

Conclusion: SPELL展示了无需标注数据即可有效优化长上下文推理的潜力，为扩展到更强大模型提供了前景。

Abstract: Progress in long-context reasoning for large language models (LLMs) has
lagged behind other recent advances. This gap arises not only from the
intrinsic difficulty of processing long texts, but also from the scarcity of
reliable human annotations and programmatically verifiable reward signals. In
this paper, we propose SPELL, a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning
framework that enables scalable, label-free optimization for long-context
reasoning. SPELL integrates three cyclical roles-questioner, responder, and
verifier-within a single model to enable continual self-improvement. The
questioner generates questions from raw documents paired with reference
answers; the responder learns to solve these questions based on the documents;
and the verifier evaluates semantic equivalence between the responder's output
and the questioner's reference answer, producing reward signals to guide
continual training. To stabilize training, we introduce an automated curriculum
that gradually increases document length and a reward function that adapts
question difficulty to the model's evolving capabilities. Extensive experiments
on six long-context benchmarks show that SPELL consistently improves
performance across diverse LLMs and outperforms equally sized models fine-tuned
on large-scale annotated data. Notably, SPELL achieves an average 7.6-point
gain in pass@8 on the strong reasoning model Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, raising
its performance ceiling and showing promise for scaling to even more capable
models.

TL;DR: 提出Q-Tuning框架，通过联合优化样本级和token级剪枝，在仅使用12.5%训练数据的情况下，在SmolLM2-1.7B上实现比全数据SFT基准平均提升38%的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据剪枝方法存在设计碎片化问题，要么单独在样本级别操作，要么单独在token级别操作，无法联合优化两个维度，导致显著的低效率。

Method: 引入错误-不确定性(EU)平面诊断框架，提出Q-Tuning统一框架：第一阶段进行样本级筛选，保留富含信息性误解或校准信号的样本；第二阶段应用非对称token剪枝策略，仅从误解样本中修剪不显著token，完整保留校准样本。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试中创造了新的最先进水平，在SmolLM2-1.7B上仅使用12.5%原始训练数据就实现了比全数据SFT基准平均提升38%的效果。

Conclusion: Q-Tuning是第一个持续超越全数据训练的动态剪枝方法，为预算受限的LLM SFT提供了实用且可扩展的数据利用最大化蓝图。

Abstract: As supervised fine-tuning (SFT) evolves from a lightweight post-training step
into a compute-intensive phase rivaling mid-training in scale, data efficiency
has become critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) under tight
budgets. Existing data pruning methods suffer from a fragmented design: they
operate either at the sample level or the token level in isolation, failing to
jointly optimize both dimensions. This disconnect leads to significant
inefficiencies--high-value samples may still contain redundant tokens, while
token-level pruning often discards crucial instructional or corrective signals
embedded in individual examples. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the
Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane, a diagnostic framework that jointly characterizes
the heterogeneous utility of training data across samples and tokens. Guided by
this insight, we propose Quadrant-based Tuning (Q-Tuning), a unified framework
that strategically coordinates sample pruning and token pruning. Q-Tuning
employs a two-stage strategy: first, it performs sample-level triage to retain
examples rich in informative misconceptions or calibration signals; second, it
applies an asymmetric token-pruning policy, using a context-aware scoring
mechanism to trim less salient tokens exclusively from misconception samples
while preserving calibration samples in their entirety. Our method sets a new
state of the art across five diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, on SmolLM2-1.7B,
Q-Tuning achieves a +38\% average improvement over the full-data SFT baseline
using only 12.5\% of the original training data. As the first dynamic pruning
approach to consistently outperform full-data training, Q-Tuning provides a
practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in
budget-constrained LLM SFT.

TL;DR: DocPruner是一个用于视觉文档检索的框架，通过自适应剪枝减少存储开销，能在保持检索性能的同时显著降低存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于多向量范式的方法虽然有效，但每个文档需要存储数百个向量，导致存储开销过大，难以在大规模部署中实用。

Method: 利用文档内部补丁注意力分布动态识别和丢弃冗余嵌入，实现自适应剪枝。

Result: 在十余个代表性数据集上的实验表明，DocPruner能将领先多向量VDR模型的存储开销减少50-60%，且检索性能下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: DocPruner为构建存储高效的大规模视觉文档检索系统提供了稳健、灵活且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), the task of retrieving visually-rich
document pages using queries that combine visual and textual cues, is crucial
for numerous real-world applications. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in a multi-vector paradigm, representing
each document as patch-level embeddings to capture fine-grained details. While
highly effective, this approach introduces a critical challenge: prohibitive
storage overhead, as storing hundreds of vectors per page makes large-scale
deployment costly and impractical. To address this, we introduce DocPruner, the
first framework to employ adaptive patch-level embedding pruning for VDR to
effectively reduce the storage overhead. DocPruner leverages the intra-document
patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant
embeddings for each document. This adaptive mechanism enables a significant
50-60% reduction in storage for leading multi-vector VDR models with negligible
degradation in document retrieval performance. Extensive experiments across
more than ten representative datasets validate that DocPruner offers a robust,
flexible, and effective solution for building storage-efficient, large-scale
VDR systems.

Motivation: 掩码扩散语言模型具有并行解码、灵活生成顺序和较少推理步骤等优势，但其解码策略和强化学习算法研究不足。直接将自回归模型的技术迁移到MDLMs存在训练-推理不一致性问题。

Method: 提出EOS早期拒绝和递增步长解码调度器，实现完整的扩散式解码；引入一致性轨迹组相对策略优化，确保滚动轨迹与优化轨迹的一致性，减少跳步优化带来的误差。

Result: 在数学和规划等推理任务上使用LLaDA-8B-Instruct进行实验，结果表明所提方法能有效且高效地驯服MDLMs，以更少解码步骤实现竞争性性能。

Conclusion: EOSER、ASS机制和CJ-GRPO方法为有效驯服掩码扩散语言模型提供了有前景的解决方案，解决了现有技术迁移中的不一致性问题。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as
parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer
inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored.
A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR
models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive
transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding
strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they
outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL
algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a
training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal
(parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and
the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early
Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which
unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding,
achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we
introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO)
for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory
and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by
skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks,
such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The
results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with
CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs.

*Zhangdie Yuan,Zifeng Ding,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EVOLVECAST框架评估LLM在新信息出现时是否适当修正预测，发现LLM的预测更新不一致且过于保守，置信度估计远低于人类标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将未来事件预测视为静态任务，未考虑随着新证据出现预测和置信度应如何演变。

Method: 引入EVOLVECAST框架，评估LLM在训练截止后新信息出现时是否修正预测，以人类预测者作为比较参考分析预测变化和置信度校准。

Result: LLM对新信息有一定响应性，但更新往往不一致或过于保守；口头和logits置信度估计均未明显优于对方，且都远低于人类标准；模型普遍表现出保守偏差。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的信念更新方法来解决LLM预测更新中的保守偏差问题。

Abstract: Prior work has largely treated future event prediction as a static task,
failing to consider how forecasts and the confidence in them should evolve as
new evidence emerges. To address this gap, we introduce EVOLVECAST, a framework
for evaluating whether large language models appropriately revise their
predictions in response to new information. In particular, EVOLVECAST assesses
whether LLMs adjust their forecasts when presented with information released
after their training cutoff. We use human forecasters as a comparative
reference to analyze prediction shifts and confidence calibration under updated
contexts. While LLMs demonstrate some responsiveness to new information, their
updates are often inconsistent or overly conservative. We further find that
neither verbalized nor logits-based confidence estimates consistently
outperform the other, and both remain far from the human reference standard.
Across settings, models tend to express conservative bias, underscoring the
need for more robust approaches to belief updating.

TL;DR: Easy Turn是一个开源的、模块化的回合转换检测模型，它整合了音频和语言双模态信息来预测四种对话状态，并发布了1,145小时的训练数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全双工交互对于自然的人机通信至关重要，但现有解决方案要么依赖未开源的专用模型，要么参数规模过大或仅支持单模态，要么需要大量稀缺的全双工数据进行微调。

Method: 提出了Easy Turn模型，这是一个开源的模块化回合转换检测模型，整合了音频和语言双模态信息，能够预测四种对话状态：完成、未完成、反馈和等待。

Result: 与现有的开源模型（如TEN Turn Detection和Smart Turn V2）相比，Easy Turn在开源的Easy Turn测试集上实现了最先进的回合转换检测准确率。

Conclusion: Easy Turn解决了现有回合转换检测模型的局限性，提供了一个开源、高效的双模态解决方案，并配套发布了大规模训练数据集，将促进全双工人机交互的发展。

Abstract: Full-duplex interaction is crucial for natural human-machine communication,
yet remains challenging as it requires robust turn-taking detection to decide
when the system should speak, listen, or remain silent. Existing solutions
either rely on dedicated turn-taking models, most of which are not
open-sourced. The few available ones are limited by their large parameter size
or by supporting only a single modality, such as acoustic or linguistic.
Alternatively, some approaches finetune LLM backbones to enable full-duplex
capability, but this requires large amounts of full-duplex data, which remain
scarce in open-source form. To address these issues, we propose Easy Turn, an
open-source, modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and
linguistic bimodal information to predict four dialogue turn states: complete,
incomplete, backchannel, and wait, accompanied by the release of Easy Turn
trainset, a 1,145-hour speech dataset designed for training turn-taking
detection models. Compared to existing open-source models like TEN Turn
Detection and Smart Turn V2, our model achieves state-of-the-art turn-taking
detection accuracy on our open-source Easy Turn testset. The data and model
will be made publicly available on GitHub.

*Claudio Fantinuoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出视觉基础口译(VGI)方法，通过整合视觉语言模型处理语音和网络摄像头视觉输入，利用上下文视觉信息提升机器口译性能，特别是在词汇消歧方面取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器口译系统仅依赖单一语言模态，在需要视觉、情境或语用信息进行消歧和确保充分性的场景中性能受限，需要多模态方法来解决这些限制。

Method: 开发原型系统，集成视觉语言模型处理语音和网络摄像头视觉输入，构建手工诊断语料库针对三种歧义类型进行评估。

Result: 视觉基础显著改善词汇消歧，在性别解析方面获得适度但不稳定的改进，对句法歧义没有明显益处。

Conclusion: 采用多模态方法是提升机器口译翻译质量的必要步骤，特别是在需要上下文视觉信息进行消歧的场景中。

Abstract: Machine Interpreting systems are currently implemented as unimodal, real-time
speech-to-speech architectures, processing translation exclusively on the basis
of the linguistic signal. Such reliance on a single modality, however,
constrains performance in contexts where disambiguation and adequacy depend on
additional cues, such as visual, situational, or pragmatic information. This
paper introduces Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI), a novel approach designed
to address the limitations of unimodal machine interpreting. We present a
prototype system that integrates a vision-language model to process both speech
and visual input from a webcam, with the aim of priming the translation process
through contextual visual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of this
approach, we constructed a hand-crafted diagnostic corpus targeting three types
of ambiguity. In our evaluation, visual grounding substantially improves
lexical disambiguation, yields modest and less stable gains for gender
resolution, and shows no benefit for syntactic ambiguities. We argue that
embracing multimodality represents a necessary step forward for advancing
translation quality in machine interpreting.

TL;DR: HiPO框架通过自适应推理控制让LLMs选择性使用详细推理或直接回答，在保持准确性的同时显著减少token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs依赖链式思维推理提高复杂任务准确性，但总是生成冗长推理痕迹效率低下，导致过多token使用和更高推理成本。

Method: 结合混合数据管道（提供配对的详细推理和直接回答响应）与混合强化学习奖励系统，平衡准确性和效率，避免过度依赖详细推理。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，HiPO能显著减少token长度，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: HiPO为高效自适应推理提供了原则性方法，推进推理导向LLMs在资源敏感实际场景中的部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. However, always generating
lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and
higher inference costs. This paper introduces the Hybrid Policy Optimization
(i.e., HiPO), a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to
selectively decide when to engage in detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to
respond directly (Think-off). Specifically, HiPO combines a hybrid data
pipelineproviding paired Think-on and Think-off responseswith a hybrid
reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency
while avoiding over-reliance on detailed reasoning. Experiments across
mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate that HiPO can substantially
reduce token length while maintaining or improving accuracy. Finally, we hope
HiPO a can be a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing
the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in real-world, resource-sensitive
settings.

TL;DR: 提出了ByteSized32Refactored，一个重构、模块化且可扩展的文本游戏生成实现，通过GameBasic.py基础库抽象7个基类，将代码从2万行减少到1万行，提高了可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟交互式世界模型仍然是大型语言模型的核心挑战，需要更高效、可扩展的文本游戏生成框架。

Method: 重构ByteSized32代码结构，创建GameBasic.py基础库，抽象7个基类（GameObject等）为可复用模块，采用集中化设计。

Result: 使用GPT-4o进行实验，在未见场景的文本游戏生成中，四个评估维度中有两个维度质量提升，另外两个维度下降，表明重构代码的层次结构为LLM带来新挑战。

Conclusion: 基于基础库和模块化优化的可扩展代码结构不仅促进LLM适应环境规范，还建立了支持未来扩展的可扩展环境。

Abstract: Simulating interactive world models remains a core challenge in Large
Language Models(LLMs). In this work, we introduce the ByteSized32Refactored, a
refactored, modular, and extensible implementation of the original ByteSized32
corpus to explore the task of text game generation. We further optimize the
code structure of each text game and create the GameBasic.py foundation
library, which centralizes common logic across all 32 games by abstracting 7
base classes (GameObject, etc.) into reusable modules, thereby reducing from
20k to 10k total lines of Python code compared to the original Bytesized32. Our
refactored implementation enables extendability - with our centralized design,
ByteSized32Refactored can be more efficiently extended to include text games of
new scenarios and specifications by reusing the shared logic and
functionalities. Extensive experiments with GPT-4o demonstrate a mix of
performance - with Bytesized32Refactored, the generated text games for unseen
scenarios showcase quality improvements on two of the four evaluation
dimensions while decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical
structure of the refactored code presents new challenges for LLMs. Overall, we
highlight that our extensible code structure, centered on the foundation
library and the modular optimization, not only facilitates LLM adaptation to
environment specifications but also establishes a scalable environment that
supports future extensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好对齐方法如RLHF或DPO需要精心策划的数据和昂贵的参数优化，导致任务特定的固化模型。PaLRS旨在提供更高效、灵活的训练免费替代方案。

Method: 从少量偏好对中提取残差流中的偏好信号，创建轻量级引导向量，在推理时应用这些向量来引导模型行为。

Result: PaLRS在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中实现了一致的性能提升，同时保持了基线通用性能。与DPO对齐模型相比表现更好且节省大量时间。

Conclusion: PaLRS为偏好对齐提供了一种有效、高效且灵活的替代方案，实现了训练免费、即插即用的对齐机制，仅需最少数据。

Abstract: Preference alignment is a critical step in making Large Language Models
(LLMs) useful and aligned with (human) preferences. Existing approaches such as
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization
typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of
parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this
work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual
Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals
encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference
pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be
applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We
evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that
PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and
code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose
performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better
with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective,
much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference
optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for
alignment with minimal data.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了完整模型、蒸馏模型和量化模型在机器翻译任务中的性能与效率权衡，发现模型压缩策略能显著降低计算需求和环境影响，同时保持竞争力的翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速扩展，其计算和环境成本日益受到关注，需要研究如何在保持性能的同时提高效率。

Method: 使用Flores+基准测试和人工评估，比较完整3.3B fp32模型、蒸馏模型和量化模型在法语、印地语和卡纳达语翻译中的表现，并分析碳排放。

Result: 完整3.3B模型BLEU得分最高但碳排放最大（每运行0.007-0.008 kg CO2），蒸馏模型推理速度快4.5倍且BLEU下降很小，INT4量化仍保持高准确性和流畅度。

Conclusion: 模型压缩策略能显著降低计算需求和环境影响，同时保持竞争力翻译质量，但在低资源设置中权衡更明显，需要将效率和可持续性纳入NLP评估框架。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about their computational and environmental costs. This study investigates the
trade-offs between translation quality and efficiency by comparing full-scale,
distilled, and quantized models using machine translation as a case study. We
evaluated performance on the Flores+ benchmark and through human judgments of
conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Our analysis of
carbon emissions per evaluation run revealed that the full 3.3B fp32 model,
while achieving the highest BLEU scores, incurred the largest environmental
footprint (about 0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). The distilled models achieved an
inference of up to 4.5x faster than the full 3.3B model, with only minimal
reductions in BLEU scores. Human evaluations also showed that even aggressive
quantization (INT4) preserved high levels of accuracy and fluency, with
differences between models generally minor. These findings demonstrate that
model compression strategies can substantially reduce computational demands and
environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though
trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings. We argue for
evaluation frameworks that integrate efficiency and sustainability alongside
objective metrics as central dimensions of progress in NLP.

Motivation: 随着自主AI代理在工业中日益部署，需要保护它们的安全。

Result: 在多样化应用中验证了该方法，展示了可扩展且可审计的流程。

Conclusion: 该方法弥合了关键的政策与实践差距，为可验证更安全且更可监管的AI铺平了道路。

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in industry, it is
essential to safeguard them. We introduce a novel framework that automates the
translation of unstructured design documents into verifiable, real-time
guardrails. We introduce "Policy as Prompt," a new approach that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and enforce natural language policies by
applying contextual understanding and the principle of least privilege. Our
system first ingests technical artifacts to construct a verifiable policy tree,
which is then compiled into lightweight, prompt-based classifiers that audit
agent behavior at runtime. We validate our approach across diverse
applications, demonstrating a scalable and auditable pipeline that bridges the
critical policy-to-practice gap, paving the way for verifiably safer and more
regulatable AI.

TL;DR: 提出了MCPMark基准测试，用于更全面、真实地评估MCP在复杂工作流中的表现，包含127个高质量任务，要求丰富的CRUD操作交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCP基准测试范围狭窄，主要关注读取密集型任务或交互深度有限的任务，无法捕捉真实工作流的复杂性和现实性。

Method: 创建包含127个高质量任务的基准测试，每个任务都有精心设计的初始状态和自动验证脚本，要求丰富的环境交互和CRUD操作。使用最小化代理框架在工具调用循环中进行评估。

Result: 最佳模型gpt-5-medium仅达到52.56% pass@1和33.86% pass^4，其他强模型如claude-sonnet-4和o3低于30% pass@1和15% pass^4。LLMs平均需要16.2个执行轮次和17.4个工具调用。

Conclusion: MCPMark突显了现有MCP基准测试的局限性，展示了在复杂真实场景中LLM代理的挑战性，为未来研究提供了更严格的评估标准。

Abstract: MCP standardizes how LLMs interact with external systems, forming the
foundation for general agents. However, existing MCP benchmarks remain narrow
in scope: they focus on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction
depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows.
To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate MCP
use in a more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of $127$
high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents.
Each task begins with a curated initial state and includes a programmatic
script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse
interactions with the environment, involving a broad range of create, read,
update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
cutting-edge LLMs using a minimal agent framework that operates in a
tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model,
gpt-5-medium, reaches only $52.56$\% pass@1 and $33.86$\% pass^4, while other
widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below
$30$\% pass@1 and $15$\% pass^4. On average, LLMs require $16.2$ execution
turns and $17.4$ tool calls per task, significantly surpassing those in
previous MCP benchmarks and highlighting the stress-testing nature of MCPMark.

TL;DR: 提出Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM)，通过Next Sequence Prediction (NSP)统一next-token和next-block预测，能够自适应确定生成长度，兼容KV缓存，在少量训练样本下达到或超越自回归基线性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型(DLMs)具有理论效率优势，但受限于固定长度解码和与KV缓存不兼容。Block diffusion虽然缓解了这些问题，但仍强制固定块大小且需要昂贵训练。

Method: 提出Next Sequence Prediction (NSP)统一next-token和next-block预测，让模型自适应确定每步生成长度。基于NSP构建SDLM，在固定大小的掩码块内进行扩散推理，但根据模型置信度动态解码连续子序列。

Result: SDLM仅使用350万训练样本就能匹配或超越强自回归基线，吞吐量比Qwen-2.5高2.1倍。SDLM-32B模型显示出更显著的效率提升，证明了建模范式的强可扩展性。

Conclusion: SDLM通过NSP机制有效结合了扩散模型和自回归模型的优势，在保持KV缓存兼容性的同时实现了高效的自适应序列生成，展示了强大的可扩展潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have strong theoretical efficiency but are
limited by fixed-length decoding and incompatibility with key-value (KV)
caches. Block diffusion mitigates these issues, yet still enforces a fixed
block size and requires expensive training. We introduce Next Sequence
Prediction (NSP), which unifies next-token and next-block prediction, enabling
the model to adaptively determine the generation length at each step. When the
length is fixed to 1, NSP reduces to standard next-token prediction. Building
on NSP, we propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which can
retrofit pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) at minimal cost.
Specifically, SDLM performs diffusion inference within fixed-size mask blocks,
but dynamically decodes consecutive subsequences based on model confidence,
thereby preserving KV-cache compatibility and improving robustness to varying
uncertainty and semantics across the sequence. Experiments show that SDLM
matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training
samples, while achieving 2.1 higher throughput than Qwen-2.5. Notably, the
SDLM-32B model delivers even more pronounced efficiency gains, demonstrating
the strong scalability potential of our modeling paradigm. Project page and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SparseD方法，通过为扩散语言模型设计专门的稀疏注意力机制，解决现有开源DLMs推理延迟高的问题，在64k上下文长度下实现1.5倍加速且保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源扩散语言模型推理延迟高，主要原因是注意力机制在长上下文中的二次复杂度。虽然稀疏注意力在自回归模型中已有应用，但扩散模型的注意力模式具有特殊性，需要专门设计。

Method: SparseD方法：1）预先计算头特定的稀疏模式并跨步重用；2）早期去噪步骤使用全注意力，后期切换到稀疏注意力以保持生成质量。

Result: 实验结果显示SparseD实现了无损加速，在64k上下文长度和1024去噪步骤下，相比FlashAttention获得1.5倍速度提升。

Conclusion: SparseD为扩散语言模型在长上下文应用中的部署提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative to
autoregressive models (ARs), existing open-source DLMs suffer from high
inference latency. This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic
complexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs.
Intuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict
attention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections.
Such approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and
clearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity
behaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in
each head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising
steps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention
methods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to
capture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in
early denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel
sparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only
requires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them
across all steps. This prevents recomputing sparse patterns at each denoising
step. Meanwhile, SparseD uses full attention in the early steps, then switches
to sparse attention later to maintain generation quality. Together, these
establish SparseD as a practical and efficient solution for deploying DLMs in
long-context applications. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseD
achieves lossless acceleration, delivering up to $1.50\times$ speedup over
FlashAttention at a 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型虽然性能优异，但存在二次时间和内存复杂度限制，难以处理长上下文。需要开发能高效建模不同长度上下文的架构。

Method: 提出ResFormer架构，采用级联方法：使用储层计算网络捕获长期上下文依赖（线性时间），同时用传统Transformer建模短期句子依赖。

Result: 在EmoryNLP数据集上准确率提升达+22.3%，在MultiWOZ、MELD和IEMOCAP数据集上表现一致提升，且内存消耗降低。

Conclusion: ResFormer在建模广泛上下文信息方面展现出高效性和有效性，解决了Transformer在处理长序列时的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Sequence classification is essential in NLP for understanding and
categorizing language patterns in tasks like sentiment analysis, intent
detection, and topic classification. Transformer-based models, despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance, have inherent limitations due to
quadratic time and memory complexity, restricting their input length. Although
extensive efforts have aimed at reducing computational demands, processing
extensive contexts remains challenging.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose ResFormer, a novel neural network
architecture designed to model varying context lengths efficiently through a
cascaded methodology. ResFormer integrates an reservoir computing network
featuring a nonlinear readout to effectively capture long-term contextual
dependencies in linear time. Concurrently, short-term dependencies within
sentences are modeled using a conventional Transformer architecture with
fixed-length inputs.
  Experiments demonstrate that ResFormer significantly outperforms baseline
models of DeepSeek-Qwen and ModernBERT, delivering an accuracy improvement of
up to +22.3% on the EmoryNLP dataset and consistent gains on MultiWOZ, MELD,
and IEMOCAP. In addition, ResFormer exhibits reduced memory consumption,
underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency in modeling extensive contextual
information.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a very important natural language processing activity
in which one identifies the polarity of a text, whether it conveys positive,
negative, or neutral sentiment. Along with the growth of social media and the
Internet, the significance of sentiment analysis has grown across numerous
industries such as marketing, politics, and customer service. Sentiment
analysis is flawed, however, when applied to foreign languages, particularly
when there is no labelled data to train models upon. In this study, we present
a transformer ensemble model and a large language model (LLM) that employs
sentiment analysis of other languages. We used multi languages dataset.
Sentiment was then assessed for sentences using an ensemble of pre-trained
sentiment analysis models: bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment, and XLM-R.
Our experimental results indicated that sentiment analysis performance was more
than 86% using the proposed method.

### [106] [Large-Scale Constraint Generation -- Can LLMs Parse Hundreds of Constraints?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24090)
*Matteo Boffa,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了大规模约束生成(LSCG)问题，评估LLMs处理大量细粒度约束的能力。通过Words Checker实例测试发现现有方法在约束数量增加时性能显著下降，并提出FoCusNet模型来筛选相关约束，提升准确率8-13%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在少量特定任务约束下的生成能力，而本文旨在评估LLMs处理大规模通用约束列表的能力，探索模型在约束数量增加时的表现。

Method: 创建Words Checker实例评估模型特性(大小、家族)和引导技术的影响；提出FoCusNet模型，将原始约束列表解析为更小的相关子集，帮助LLM专注于关键约束。

Result: 实验显示现有解决方案在约束数量增加时性能显著下降，而FoCusNet能够带来8-13%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: LLMs处理大规模约束时面临挑战，FoCusNet通过约束筛选机制有效提升了性能，为解决大规模约束生成问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent research has explored the constrained generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) when explicitly prompted by few task-specific
requirements. In contrast, we introduce Large-Scale Constraint Generation
(LSCG), a new problem that evaluates whether LLMs can parse a large,
fine-grained, generic list of constraints. To examine the LLMs' ability to
handle an increasing number constraints, we create a practical instance of
LSCG, called Words Checker. In Words Checker, we evaluate the impact of model
characteristics (e.g., size, family) and steering techniques (e.g., Simple
Prompt, Chain of Thought, Best of N) on performance. We also propose FoCusNet,
a small and dedicated model that parses the original list of constraints into a
smaller subset, helping the LLM focus on relevant constraints. Experiments
reveal that existing solutions suffer a significant performance drop as the
number of constraints increases, with FoCusNet showing an 8-13% accuracy boost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了GEAR评估框架，用于评估大语言模型的溯因推理能力，该框架无需人工标注，通过一致性、泛化性和多样性三个指标自动评分，并在四个基准测试上评估了9个模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型是否能发现新知识，以及如何评估这种能力，特别关注溯因推理——为观察生成合理解释的能力。

Method: 引入GEAR评估范式，包含三个评分指标：一致性（假设解释观察）、泛化性（假设对未见输入的预测能力）、多样性（假设集的覆盖范围）。使用该框架评估9个LLM在4个基准测试上的表现，并提出基于动量的课程学习策略。

Result: 在1,500个问题上生成了50,000多个候选假设，揭示了传统评估方法无法发现的模型差异。基于动量的课程学习策略提升了所有GEAR目标，且这些提升能迁移到现有溯因推理基准上。

Conclusion: GEAR提供了一个原则性框架，既能评估溯因推理能力，又能为LLM提供无需标注的可扩展训练信号，帮助模型生成更多样化和可靠的假设。

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models (LLMs), research has focused on
instruction following and deductive reasoning. A central question remains: can
these models discover new knowledge, and how can we evaluate this ability? We
address this by studying abductive reasoning-the generation of plausible
hypotheses to explain observations-and introduce GEAR (General Evaluation for
Abductive Reasoning), a general-purpose, fully automated, transparent, and
label-free evaluation paradigm. GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics:
consistency (each hypothesis explains the observations), generalizability
(consistent hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and
diversity (the set covers distinct predictions and patterns). Built this way,
GEAR is scalable (no human gold answers), reliable (deterministic scoring
aligned with classical abduction), and open-ended (scores improve only when
models produce new plausible hypotheses, unlike static benchmarks that saturate
once accuracy is high). Using GEAR, we conduct a fine-grained study of nine
LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000
candidate hypotheses and revealing model differences obscured by gold-answer or
purely human evaluations. We further propose a momentum-based curriculum that
adjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity: it starts with what
the model learns quickly and shifts toward harder objectives such as generating
diverse hypotheses once the model is confident on foundational objectives.
Without gold-label supervision, this strategy improves all GEAR objectives and
these gains transfer to established abductive reasoning benchmarks. Taken
together, GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and
supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more
diverse and reliable hypotheses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感分析模型存在固有的社会偏见，在现实应用中可能造成危害。构建自然、语言丰富且多样化的测试句子集成本高昂，需要领域专家或众包。

Method: 开发BTC-SAM框架，利用大语言模型进行可控的测试句子生成，以最小化规范要求生成高质量的偏见测试用例。

Result: 实验表明，依赖大语言模型可以提供测试句子中更高的语言变化和多样性，相比基础提示方法为先前未见偏见提供更好的测试覆盖率。

Conclusion: BTC-SAM框架能够有效生成高质量偏见测试用例，通过大语言模型实现更好的测试覆盖和语言多样性，解决了传统方法成本高的问题。

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis (SA) models harbor inherent social biases that can be
harmful in real-world applications. These biases are identified by examining
the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of
the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse
sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is
expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires
domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias
testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias
testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models
(LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show
that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the
test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base
prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型擅长捕捉分布语义，但道德推理在语用层面运作，这种差异导致模型在道德推理泛化方面存在困难。

Method: 提出基于道德基础理论的语用推理方法，在每一步利用上下文信息连接道德基础与道德推理目标，弥合语用差距。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著增强了大语言模型在道德推理中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于道德基础理论的未来研究奠定了基础，为解决大语言模型道德推理泛化问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Moral reasoning has emerged as a promising research direction for Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet achieving generalization remains a central
challenge. From a linguistic standpoint, this difficulty arises because LLMs
are adept at capturing distributional semantics, which fundamentally differs
from the morals which operate at the pragmatic level. This paper investigates
how LLMs can achieve generalized moral reasoning despite their reliance on
distributional semantics. We propose pragmatic inference methods grounded in
moral foundations theory, which leverage contextual information at each step to
bridge the pragmatic gap and guide LLMs in connecting moral foundations with
moral reasoning objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning, providing a
foundation for future research grounded in moral foundations theory.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have seen promising advances, yet they are still limited in
"hard-exploration" tasks requiring learning new knowledge through exploration.
We present GLoW, a novel approach leveraging dual-scale world models,
maintaining a trajectory frontier of high-value discoveries at the global

signals to guide exploration. To evaluate our framework for hard-exploration,
we tackle the Jericho benchmark suite of text-based games, where GLoW achieves
a new state-of-theart performance for LLM-based approaches. Compared to
state-of-the-art RLbased methods, our approach achieves comparable performance
while requiring 100-800x fewer environment interactions.

Abstract: As digital platforms redefine educational paradigms, ensuring interactivity

Large Language Models (MLLMs) to automatically respond to student questions
from online lectures - a novel question answering task of real world
significance. We introduce the EduVidQA Dataset with 5252 question-answer pairs

Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注点准确率，但忽略了提示的改写不变性和搜索稳定性，导致小的语义保持改写会引起大的性能波动。

Method: 提出TARE框架，包含基于采样的对抗性搜索（内部）和鲁棒选择（外部），以及ATARE变体学习各向异性权重来调整语义邻域半径。

Result: 在多样化任务上评估，该方法在保持准确率的同时显著提升了提示在改写下的稳定性，优于仅关注准确率的提示搜索方法。

Conclusion: 通过最小化文本锐度，TARE框架能够生成在语义改写下保持鲁棒性的提示，同时保持计算实用性。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on carefully
engineered prompts. However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging
from heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search,
primarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance
or searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in
practice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically
preserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this
brittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we
provide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete,
semantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion
over a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no
gradients to update the model's parameters. Then we introduce TARE (Textual
Sharpness-Aware Evolving), a derivative-free framework that alternates between
an inner, sampling-based adversarial search that stresses a prompt with hard
paraphrases and an outer, robust selection that prefers candidates whose
neighborhoods remain strong. We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic
weights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to
balance exploration and fidelity. Diverse tasks evaluate our methods, whose
design for minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to prompts that preserve
accuracy under paraphrasing, outperforming accuracy-only prompt search while
remaining computationally practical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型的比较主要关注宏观统计指标，缺乏对模型推理方式差异的深入分析。

Method: 使用生成式语言模型比较两个LRM的推理轨迹，识别特征差异，并基于经验分布建模预测推理轨迹来源，迭代构建人类可读的分类法。

Result: 在数学、科学和编程任务上比较12个开源LRM，LOT能80-100%准确区分不同规模、基础模型家族或目标领域的模型推理轨迹。案例研究中，将较小Qwen3模型的推理风格与最大Qwen3对齐，在GPQA上的准确率提升3.3-5.7%。

Conclusion: LOT提供了一种量化模型推理差异的方法，揭示了LRM在思维方式上的系统性差异，并证明推理风格对齐可以提升模型性能。

Abstract: Current comparisons of large reasoning models (LRMs) focus on macro-level
statistics such as task accuracy or reasoning length. Whether different LRMs
reason differently remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce
the LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT), a classification method that uses a
generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and
articulate their distinctive features in words. LOT then models how these
features predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical
distributions across LRM outputs. Iterating this process over a dataset of
reasoning traces yields a human-readable taxonomy that characterizes how models
think. We apply LOT to compare the reasoning of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in
math, science, and coding. LOT identifies systematic differences in their
thoughts, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from
LRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain. Beyond
classification, LOT's natural-language taxonomy provides qualitative
explanations of how LRMs think differently. Finally, in a case study, we link
the reasoning differences to performance: aligning the reasoning style of
smaller Qwen3 models with that of the largest Qwen3 during test time improves
their accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调和关于大语言模型中上下文学习机制的两个主要观点：注意力头的组件级分析和ICL整体分解为任务识别与任务学习。

Method: 使用TSLA框架识别TR和TL专用注意力头，通过相关性分析、消融研究、输入扰动以及几何分析隐藏状态的转向实验。

Result: 识别出的TR和TL头独立有效地捕捉ICL的TR和TL组件；TR头通过将隐藏状态与任务子空间对齐来促进任务识别，TL头在子空间内旋转隐藏状态朝向正确标签。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解大语言模型如何在不同任务和设置中执行上下文学习提供了统一且可解释的说明，能够调和先前关于ICL机制的发现。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of in-context learning (ICL) in
large language models by reconciling two dominant perspectives: the
component-level analysis of attention heads and the holistic decomposition of
ICL into Task Recognition (TR) and Task Learning (TL). We propose a novel
framework based on Task Subspace Logit Attribution (TSLA) to identify attention
heads specialized in TR and TL, and demonstrate their distinct yet
complementary roles. Through correlation analysis, ablation studies, and input
perturbations, we show that the identified TR and TL heads independently and
effectively capture the TR and TL components of ICL. Using steering experiments
with geometric analysis of hidden states, we reveal that TR heads promote task
recognition by aligning hidden states with the task subspace, while TL heads
rotate hidden states within the subspace toward the correct label to facilitate
prediction. We further show how previous findings on ICL mechanisms, including
induction heads and task vectors, can be reconciled with our
attention-head-level analysis of the TR-TL decomposition. Our framework thus
provides a unified and interpretable account of how large language models
execute ICL across diverse tasks and settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出学习任务向量(LTVs)方法，直接训练任务向量而非从模型输出中提取，在准确性和灵活性方面优于传统方法，并通过系统分析揭示了任务向量在Transformer中的工作机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常从模型输出或隐藏状态中提取任务向量，方法繁琐且不透明，且很少阐明任务向量如何影响计算机制。本文旨在解决这两个局限性。

Method: 提出直接训练学习任务向量(LTVs)，并通过系统分析研究任务向量的机制作用，包括在低层次通过注意力头OV电路引导预测，以及在高层次分析任务向量传播的线性特性。

Result: LTVs在准确性上超越提取的任务向量，能在任意层、位置甚至ICL提示中有效工作。分析发现任务向量主要通过注意力头OV电路引导预测，早期任务向量被旋转到任务相关子空间，后期任务向量主要进行幅度缩放。

Conclusion: LTVs不仅提供了获取有效任务向量的实用方法，还为理解ICL的机制基础提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform new tasks from in-context
demonstrations, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent work
suggests that these demonstrations are compressed into task vectors (TVs),
compact task representations that LLMs exploit for predictions. However, prior
studies typically extract TVs from model outputs or hidden states using
cumbersome and opaque methods, and they rarely elucidate the mechanisms by
which TVs influence computation. In this work, we address both limitations.
First, we propose directly training Learned Task Vectors (LTVs), which surpass
extracted TVs in accuracy and exhibit superior flexibility-acting effectively
at arbitrary layers, positions, and even with ICL prompts. Second, through
systematic analysis, we investigate the mechanistic role of TVs, showing that
at the low level they steer predictions primarily through attention-head OV
circuits, with a small subset of "key heads" most decisive. At a higher level,
we find that despite Transformer nonlinearities, TV propagation is largely
linear: early TVs are rotated toward task-relevant subspaces to improve logits
of relevant labels, while later TVs are predominantly scaled in magnitude.
Taken together, LTVs not only provide a practical approach for obtaining
effective TVs but also offer a principled lens into the mechanistic foundations
of ICL.

Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的GUI代理在真实应用中效果有限，主要受限于训练数据稀缺和复杂任务的长尾知识需求，特别是罕见和未见场景的处理能力。

Method: 首先通过监督微调进行预热，然后通过自引导拒绝采样微调进一步优化。该框架设计为模型无关的通用插件，可在推理时利用网络教程。

Result: 在三个不同任务上的评估显示，RAG-GUI始终优于基线代理，在两个模型尺寸上比其他推理基线提升2.6%到13.3%。

Conclusion: RAG-GUI展示了强大的泛化能力和在实际场景中的即插即用能力，有效提升了GUI代理在复杂数字任务中的表现。

Abstract: GUI agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in
automating complex digital tasks. However, their effectiveness in real-world
applications is often limited by scarce training data and the inherent
complexity of these tasks, which frequently require long-tailed knowledge
covering rare, unseen scenarios. We propose RAG-GUI , a lightweight VLM that
leverages web tutorials at inference time. RAG-GUI is first warm-started via
supervised finetuning (SFT) and further refined through self-guided rejection
sampling finetuning (RSF). Designed to be model-agnostic, RAG-GUI functions as
a generic plug-in that enhances any VLM-based agent. Evaluated across three
distinct tasks, it consistently outperforms baseline agents and surpasses other
inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes, demonstrating
strong generalization and practical plug-and-play capabilities in real-world
scenarios.

Motivation: 传统准确率指标无法捕捉问题特征和提供主题特定见解，而LLMs在医疗高风险应用中需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 使用项目反应理论(IRT)，对80个不同LLMs在1,100个USMLE对齐问题上的响应进行前瞻性收集，为每个主题建立单维双参数逻辑IRT模型。

Result: 发现LLMs具有独特的"尖峰"能力分布，GPT-5在多数领域表现最佳(11个中的8个)，但在社会科学和沟通领域被Claude-3-opus超越。IRT还能识别有缺陷的问题。

Conclusion: 建立了一个基于心理测量学的稳健方法，为LLMs在医疗保健中的安全、有效和可信部署提供了决策支持框架。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for high-stakes
medical applications, there has emerged a critical need for reliable and
accurate evaluation methodologies. Traditional accuracy metrics fail
inadequately as they neither capture question characteristics nor offer
topic-specific insights. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{MedIRT}, a
rigorous evaluation framework grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT), the gold
standard in high-stakes educational testing. Unlike previous research relying
on archival data, we prospectively gathered fresh responses from 80 diverse
LLMs on a balanced, 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark. Using one
unidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT model per topic, we estimate LLM's
latent model ability jointly with question difficulty and discrimination,
yielding more stable and nuanced performance rankings than accuracy alone.
Notably, we identify distinctive ``spiky'' ability profiles, where overall
rankings can be misleading due to highly specialized model abilities. While
\texttt{GPT-5} was the top performer in a majority of domains (8 of 11), it was
outperformed in Social Science and Communication by \texttt{Claude-3-opus},
demonstrating that even an overall 23rd-ranked model can hold the top spot for
specific competencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate IRT's utility in auditing
benchmarks by identifying flawed questions. We synthesize these findings into a
practical decision-support framework that integrates our multi-factor
competency profiles with operational metrics. This work establishes a robust,
psychometrically grounded methodology essential for the safe, effective, and
trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统使用LLM直接生成用户偏好列表的方法虽然有效，但存在决策过程不透明、限制个性化、加剧流行度偏见等问题，需要更透明和可解释的用户偏好建模方法。

Method: 通过logit-probing和生成式分类技术，在稳定的偏好簇格上推断用户的动态概率分布，将用户偏好建模为分布映射而非直接生成列表。

Result: 在公开基准测试(Yelp, MovieLens)上，NDCG指标比直接生成基线提升高达40%；在短视频平台大规模真实数据集上，长尾内容排序表现优异，NDCG分数比SOTA生产模型高出7倍。

Conclusion: PET框架将用户画像模型从直接偏好列表生成转变为透明的分布偏好映射，为更可解释、公平和多样化的个性化系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding how user preference evolves over time is a fundamental
challenge central to modern digital ecosystems, for which Large Language Models
(LLMs) are an increasingly prominent and popular approach due to their ability
to comprehend the rich semantic context within behavioral data. A common
practice is to use LLMs to predict a user's next action by directly generating
a ranked list of preferred items. Although effective for short-term prediction,
the end-to-end generation paradigm inherently limits personalization. Its
opaque decision-making process obscures holistic user profiling and exacerbates
popularity bias. To address these limitations, we propose Preference Evolution
Tracking (PET), a framework that reframes the task as inferring a dynamic
probability distribution over a stable and interpretable lattice of preference
clusters. By applying logit-probing and generative classification techniques,
PET infers a user's preference as a probability distribution, enabling
transparent preference learning. On public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens), PET
improves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG over direct generation baselines.
On a large-scale, real-world dataset from a short-video platform, it excels at
ranking long-tail contents, significantly outperforming a SOTA production model
by 7 times in the NDCG score. Ultimately, PET transforms the user profile model
from direct preference list generation to a transparent distributional
preference mapping, paving the way for more explainable, fair, and diverse
personalization systems.

Result: 在10个数据集的3个推理密集型任务上，AceSearcher平均精确匹配提升7.6%。32B版本在文档级金融推理任务上仅用DeepSeek-V3不到5%的参数达到相同性能，小规模版本（1.5B和8B）也超越了参数量多9倍的现有搜索增强LLMs。

Conclusion: AceSearcher在解决复杂推理任务方面展现出卓越的效率和有效性，无需中间标注，参数效率极高。

Abstract: Search-augmented LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to
ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability. We propose
AceSearcher, a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large
language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks
down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer
generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of
search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning
optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate
annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10
datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on
document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance
of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller
scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented
LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and
effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks. Our code will be published
at https://github.com/ritaranx/AceSearcher and

### [120] [Can Large Language Models Express Uncertainty Like Human?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24202)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出语言置信度(LC)作为LLM不确定性估计的轻量级替代方案，通过构建大规模对冲表达数据集和轻量级映射器，系统研究了现代LLM的语言置信度表现，并提出了改进框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有置信度估计方法存在实际障碍：logits通常被隐藏、多采样计算成本高、数值化不确定性表达不符合自然沟通。语言置信度通过对冲语言表达不确定性，提供了轻量级和以人为本的替代方案。

Method: 1) 发布首个多样化、大规模的对冲表达数据集；2) 提出轻量级映射器将对冲表达转换为置信度分数；3) 系统研究现代LLM在QA基准上的语言置信度表现；4) 引入微调框架进一步改进语言置信度可靠性。

Result: 研究发现大多数LLM在表达可靠语言置信度方面表现不佳，但精心设计的提示可以达到竞争性的校准和区分能力。微调框架进一步提高了语言置信度的可靠性。

Conclusion: 语言置信度作为LLM不确定性估计的可扩展、高效且与人类对齐的方法具有潜力，值得深入探索这一有前景但尚未充分开发的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where overconfident responses can mislead users. Reliable confidence estimation
has been shown to enhance trust and task accuracy. Yet existing methods face
practical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally
expensive, and verbalized numerical uncertainty (e.g., giving a 0-100 score)
deviates from natural communication. We revisit linguistic confidence (LC),
where models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably,
might), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this
direction, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging
expressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a
lightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero
cost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of
LC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs
underperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves
competitive calibration and discriminability. Finally, we (4) introduce a
fine-tuning framework that further improves LC reliability. Taken together, our
work positions linguistic confidence as a scalable, efficient, and
human-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation, and calls for deeper
exploration of this promising yet underexplored direction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BeyondBench是一个通过算法问题生成来避免训练数据污染的评估框架，包含44个算法任务和117种变体，分为三个难度级别，评估了101个语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于静态基准测试存在训练数据污染风险，难以公平评估语言模型是真正推理还是仅回忆答案，因此需要创建不受污染的新评估方法。

Method: 使用算法问题生成框架，在运行时动态创建数学基础的问题，确保测试的新鲜性和无污染性。框架包含44个算法任务，分为易、中、难三个难度级别，每个任务从超过10^15个独特实例的组合空间中生成问题。

Result: 评估了101个语言模型（85个开源和16个闭源），结果显示所有模型家族都存在一致的推理缺陷，随着问题复杂度从多项式增加到指数级，性能急剧下降。在困难套件中，Gemini-2.5-pro、Llama-3.3-70B和Qwen2.5-72B的平均准确率分别为56.38%、26.91%和33.60%。

Conclusion: BeyondBench提供了一个有效避免数据污染的评估框架，揭示了语言模型在复杂推理任务上的显著局限性，特别是在不使用工具的情况下性能大幅下降。

Abstract: Evaluating language models fairly is becoming harder as static benchmarks
available on the internet risk contamination by training data. This makes it
unclear whether models are truly reasoning or just recalling answers. In this
paper, we introduce BeyondBench, an evaluation framework that avoids this
problem by using algorithmic problem generation. Unlike traditional benchmarks
that risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates
mathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh
and uncontaminated. Our framework covers 44 algorithmic tasks with a total of
117 variations, grouped into three difficulty levels: the Easy Suite (29 tasks)
for basic arithmetic and statistics, the Medium Suite (5 tasks, 49 variations)
for sequence patterns and reasoning, and the Hard Suite (10 tasks, 68
variations) tackling NP-complete and constraint satisfaction problems. Each
task generates problems from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique
instances, with solutions verified deterministically by mathematical proofs. We
evaluated 101 language models, including 85 open-source and 16 closed-source
models, spanning sizes from 0.5B to 141B parameters and multiple quantization
schemes. Our results show consistent reasoning deficiencies across model
families, with performance degrading sharply as problem complexity increases
from polynomial to exponential. In our Hard Suite evaluations, models such as
Gemini-2.5-pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Qwen2.5-72B achieved average accuracies of
56.38%, 26.91%, and 33.60%, respectively. Moreover, we observe that performance
drops drastically without tool usage, with GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5-nano
showing a decline of 16.81%, 28.05%, and 47.59% accuracy on the hard suite. Our
leaderboard is publicly available at https://ctrl-gaurav.github.io/BeyondBench/

*Zahra Atf,Peter R Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScenarioBench是一个用于评估文本到SQL和检索增强生成在合规场景中的基准测试，包含端到端评分系统，强调决策准确性和可追溯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL或KILT/RAG基准测试缺乏将决策与条款级证据严格关联的机制，无法在明确时间预算下评估解释质量。

Method: 通过YAML场景包含不可见的黄金标准包、最小见证轨迹、管辖条款集和规范SQL，系统必须使用相同政策规范中的条款ID来证明输出。

Result: 评估器报告决策准确性、轨迹质量、检索效果、SQL正确性、政策覆盖率、延迟和解释幻觉率，并引入标准化场景难度指数。

Conclusion: ScenarioBench在严格基础和不可见规则下将每个决策与条款级证据关联，在明确时间预算下将收益转向解释质量。

Abstract: ScenarioBench is a policy-grounded, trace-aware benchmark for evaluating
Text-to-SQL and retrieval-augmented generation in compliance contexts. Each
YAML scenario includes a no-peek gold-standard package with the expected
decision, a minimal witness trace, the governing clause set, and the canonical
SQL, enabling end-to-end scoring of both what a system decides and why. Systems
must justify outputs using clause IDs from the same policy canon, making
explanations falsifiable and audit-ready. The evaluator reports decision
accuracy, trace quality (completeness, correctness, order), retrieval
effectiveness, SQL correctness via result-set equivalence, policy coverage,
latency, and an explanation-hallucination rate. A normalized Scenario
Difficulty Index (SDI) and a budgeted variant (SDI-R) aggregate results while
accounting for retrieval difficulty and time. Compared with prior Text-to-SQL
or KILT/RAG benchmarks, ScenarioBench ties each decision to clause-level
evidence under strict grounding and no-peek rules, shifting gains toward
justification quality under explicit time budgets.

Result: MoVa的提示策略在多个领域和框架中优于微调模型，新应用有助于评估心理调查问卷。

Conclusion: MoVa的数据和方法可以促进对人类和机器通信的细粒度解释，对机器行为对齐具有潜在影响。

Abstract: Identifying human morals and values embedded in language is essential to
empirical studies of communication. However, researchers often face substantial
difficulty navigating the diversity of theoretical frameworks and data
available for their analysis. Here, we contribute MoVa, a well-documented suite
of resources for generalizable classification of human morals and values,
consisting of (1) 16 labeled datasets and benchmarking results from four
theoretically-grounded frameworks; (2) a lightweight LLM prompting strategy
that outperforms fine-tuned models across multiple domains and frameworks; and
(3) a new application that helps evaluate psychological surveys. In practice,
we specifically recommend a classification strategy, all@once, that scores all
related concepts simultaneously, resembling the well-known multi-label
classifier chain. The data and methods in MoVa can facilitate many fine-grained
interpretations of human and machine communication, with potential implications
for the alignment of machine behavior.

Abstract: This paper presents the opdainlp team's solution for the GPU track of the
CPDC 2025 challenge. The challenge consists of three tasks, aiming to build an
in-game conversational AI that adheres to character personas, aligns with the
game's worldview, and supports function calling. Considering both effectiveness
and resource/time constraints during inference, we synthesized data for some of
the tasks based on the datasets provided by the competition organizers. We
employed Qwen3-14B with LoRA fine-tuning and model fusion, and utilized a base
model integrated with multiple LoRA adapters during inference. Specifically, in
the competition, we used three distinct LoRA adapters to handle tool calling,
response generation with tool call results, and response generation without
tool call results, respectively. MultiLoRA inference was implemented using
vLLM. Our solution achieved the first place in Task 1 and Task 3, and the
second place in Task 2 of the GPU track.

TL;DR: MetaTuner是一个联合集成提示优化和微调的新框架，通过共享编码层实现知识共享，在多个基准测试中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常孤立地研究提示优化和微调这两种提升大语言模型性能的方法，而它们之间的协同潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入两个神经网络分别生成提示和参数，共享底层编码层实现知识共享，设计监督正则化损失来有效训练框架。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MetaTuner成功展示了提示优化和微调的协同作用，为大语言模型训练提供了新的有效框架。

Abstract: Prompt optimization and fine-tuning are two major approaches to improve the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). They enhance the capabilities of
LLMs from complementary perspectives: the former through explicit natural
language, and the latter through implicit parameter updates. However, prior
work has typically studied them in isolation, leaving their synergistic
potential largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we
introduce MetaTuner, a novel framework that jointly integrates prompt
optimization and fine-tuning for LLM training. Specifically, we introduce two
neural networks to generate prompts and parameters, respectively, while
allowing them to share a common bottom encoding layer to enable knowledge
sharing. By the guidance of the final supervised signals, our framework is
optimized to discover the optimal combinations between the prompts and
parameters. Given that prompt learning involves discrete optimization while
fine-tuning operates in a continuous parameter space, we design a supervised
regularization loss to train our framework effectively. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms the
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能家居环境中LLM代理面临的独特挑战：潜在用户意图理解、时间依赖、设备约束、调度等，以及缺乏真实模拟环境和评估基准的问题。

Method: 开发基于Matter协议的SimuHome模拟器，支持时间加速、设备模拟、API调用和环境变量变化，提供600个测试场景的基准。

Result: 评估11个代理显示，即使最佳模型GPT-4.1成功率仅54%，代理在潜在意图推理、状态验证和时间调度方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够可靠验证当前状态并通过工具协调时间相关操作的方法，以提升智能家居代理的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks.
However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle
latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and
more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such
capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where
agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a
challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce
$\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart
devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables.
By building the simulator on the Matter protocol (the global industry standard
for smart home communication), SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment,
and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant
devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600
episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned
capabilities. Our evaluation of 11 agents under a unified ReAct framework
reveals that while models perform well on simple tasks, they struggle with
latent intent inference, state verification, and especially temporal
scheduling. Even the top-performing model, GPT-4.1, reaches only 54% success
rate. These findings highlight a critical need for methods that can reliably
verify the current state via tools before acting and coordinate time-dependent
actions.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的嵌入方法通常采用编码器范式，将LLM视为静态特征提取器，忽视了其核心的生成能力。

Method: 提出GIRCSE框架，利用自回归生成迭代优化语义表示，通过生成软标记序列并在对比目标下优化，捕捉编码器方法容易忽略的潜在概念和隐式语义。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试和指令跟随任务中超越了强大的LLM嵌入基线，并展现出测试时扩展特性：推理时生成更多标记能持续提升嵌入质量。

Conclusion: 生成式迭代优化为表示学习建立了新的范式。

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM)-based embeddings typically adopt an
encoder-only paradigm, treating LLMs as static feature extractors and
overlooking their core generative strengths. We introduce GIRCSE (Generative
Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework
that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic
representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under
contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics
that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an
Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each
refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show
that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB
benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an
emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference
steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative
refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.

Abstract: Grounded theory offers deep insights from qualitative data, but its reliance

Current computational tools stop short of true automation, keeping researchers
firmly in the loop. We introduce LOGOS, a novel, end-to-end framework that
fully automates the grounded theory workflow, transforming raw text into a
structured, hierarchical theory. LOGOS integrates LLM-driven coding, semantic
clustering, graph reasoning, and a novel iterative refinement process to build
highly reusable codebooks. To ensure fair comparison, we also introduce a
principled 5-dimensional metric and a train-test split protocol for
standardized, unbiased evaluation. Across five diverse corpora, LOGOS
consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves a remarkable $88.2\%$
alignment with an expert-developed schema on a complex dataset. LOGOS
demonstrates a powerful new path to democratize and scale qualitative research

Motivation: 扩散大语言模型由于其迭代和并行生成机制，存在与自回归LLMs根本不同的安全漏洞，需要专门的安全防御方案。

Method: 提出DiffuGuard防御框架，包含随机退火重掩码(动态引入可控随机性)和块级审计修复(利用内部模型表示进行风险检测和引导修正)。

Result: 在四个dLLM上的实验表明，DiffuGuard能有效抵御六种不同的越狱方法，将攻击成功率从47.9%降至14.7%，同时保持模型效用和效率。

Conclusion: dLLMs具有显著的内在安全潜力，DiffuGuard通过训练免费的防御框架成功解锁了这种潜力，为dLLM安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduces
unprecedented vulnerabilities that are fundamentally distinct from
Autoregressive LLMs, stemming from their iterative and parallel generation
mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of dLLM
vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks across two distinct dimensions: intra-step
and inter-step dynamics. Experimental results reveal a harmful bias inherent in
the standard greedy remasking strategy and identify a critical phenomenon we
term Denoising-path Dependence, where the safety of early-stage tokens
decisively influences the final output. These findings also indicate that while
current decoding strategies constitute a significant vulnerability, dLLMs
possess a substantial intrinsic safety potential. To unlock this potential, we
propose DiffuGuard, a training-free defense framework that addresses
vulnerabilities through a dual-stage approach: Stochastic Annealing Remasking
dynamically introduces controlled randomness to mitigate greedy selection bias,
while Block-level Audit and Repair exploits internal model representations for
autonomous risk detection and guided correction. Comprehensive experiments on
four dLLMs demonstrate DiffuGuard's exceptional effectiveness, reducing Attack
Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while
preserving model utility and efficiency. Our code is available at:

Result: 实验显示最先进模型能生成MMQAs但仍有明显差距，顶级理解模型在质量评估上与人类判断高度一致。Q-Mirror代理将平均分从78.90提升到85.22，通过率从72%提升到95%。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模科学基准测试提供了实用路径，通过自动化框架有效提升了多模态问答对的质量和评估效果。

Abstract: High-quality, multi-modal benchmarks are crucial for advancing scientific
reasoning in large models yet their manual creation is costly and unscalable.
To address this bottleneck, we explore the potential for transforming Text-Only
QA Pairs (TQAs) into high-quality Multi-Modal QA Pairs (MMQAs), which include
three parts: 1) Task Definition \& Evaluation Rubric: We develop a TQA-to-MMQA
framework and establish a comprehensive, multi-dimensional MMQA quality rubric
that provides principles for the transformation. 2) Benchmark Construction:
Then we construct two extensive benchmarks to rigorously evaluate
state-of-the-art generation \& understanding models on the distinct tasks of
MMQA generation \& MMQA quality evaluation. 3) Preliminary Solution: We develop
an agentic system (Q-Mirror), which operationalizes our framework by
integrating MMQA generation and evaluation into a closed loop for iterative
refinement. Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art models can
generate MMQAs, their outputs still leave substantial gaps, underscoring the
need for reliable evaluation. We further demonstrate that top-tier
understanding models align closely with human judgment in MMQA quality
assessment. Leveraging both insights, the Q-Mirror agent raises average scores
from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72\% to 95\%, offering a practical path
to large-scale scientific benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了LLMs表达价值观的两种机制：内在表达（训练习得）和提示表达（通过显式提示引发），发现它们部分共享关键组件但各有独特元素，导致不同的可操控性和响应多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs价值观表达的内在机制和提示机制是否重叠或依赖不同机制，这对价值观对齐和角色引导应用至关重要。

Method: 使用两种方法分析机制：(1) 价值观向量 - 从残差流中提取代表价值观机制的特征方向；(2) 价值观神经元 - 贡献于价值观表达的MLP神经元。

Result: 发现内在和提示价值观机制部分共享诱导价值观表达的关键组件，但也各有独特元素，导致不同的可操控性（提示>内在）和响应多样性（内在>提示）。

Conclusion: 内在机制独特组件促进词汇多样性，而提示机制独特组件主要强化指令遵循，甚至在越狱等远程任务中也发挥作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct
ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned
during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts.
Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is
paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly
whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially
different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at
the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature
directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream,
and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We
demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common
components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess
unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms
lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and
response diversity (intrinsic > prompted). In particular, components unique to
the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas
those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances in
language understanding, marking a significant step toward artificial general
intelligence (AGI). With increasing demands for higher-level semantics and
cross-modal fusion, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged,
integrating diverse information sources (e.g., text, vision, and audio) to
enhance modeling and reasoning in complex scenarios. In AI for Science,
multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning has become a rapidly growing
frontier. While LLMs and MLLMs have achieved notable progress in this area, the
field still lacks a systematic review that consolidates recent developments. To
address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLMs and MLLMs
for emotion recognition and reasoning, covering model architectures, datasets,
and performance benchmarks. We further highlight key challenges and outline
future research directions, aiming to offer researchers both an authoritative
reference and practical insights for advancing this domain. To the best of our
knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to comprehensively survey the
intersection of MLLMs with multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning. The

*Sungkyun Kim,Jaemin Kim,Dogyung Yoon,Jiho Shin,Junyeol Lee,Jiwon Seo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Speculative Verification (SV)方法，通过动态预测推测准确率和自适应验证长度来提高大语言模型推理效率，相比传统推测解码方法性能提升最高达2倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码方法在推测准确率低时，由于拒绝令牌的开销会抵消其优势，特别是在大批量情况下效率受限

Method: 引入一个与草稿模型大小相似的辅助模型来估计草稿模型和目标模型分布的对齐程度，动态调整验证长度以最大化吞吐量

Result: 在9种不同模型组合和3个NLP任务上的实验表明，SV在所有批次大小(4-80)下都优于传统推测解码和目标模型标准解码，大批量设置下平均加速1.4倍

Conclusion: SV方法具有鲁棒性、可扩展性和实用价值，无需修改草稿或目标模型，且与现有推测解码变体兼容

Abstract: LLMs have low GPU efficiency and high latency due to autoregressive decoding.
Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this using a small draft model to
speculatively generate multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by
a target model. However, when speculation accuracy is low, the overhead from
rejected tokens can offset the benefits, limiting SD's effectiveness,
especially at large batch sizes. To address this, we propose Speculative
Verification (SV), an efficient augmentation to SD that dynamically predicts
speculation accuracy and adapts the verification length to maximize throughput.
SV introduces a companion model - a small auxiliary model similar in size to
the draft model - to estimate the alignment between draft and target model
distributions. By maximizing the information gain from quantifying this
alignment, SV refines verification decisions, reducing wasted computation on
rejected tokens and improving decoding efficiency. Moreover, SV requires no
modifications to the draft or target models and is compatible with existing SD
variants. We extensively evaluated SV on publicly available LLMs across three
NLP tasks using nine combinations of draft, companion, and target models,
including 13B-72B target models and three types of variations: base (no
finetuning), instruction-tuned, and task fine-tuned. Across all experiments and
batch sizes (4-80), SV consistently outperforms both SD and standard decoding
with the target model. It improves SD performance by up to 2$\times$, with an
average speedup of 1.4 $\times$ in large-batch settings (batch sizes 32-80).
These results demonstrate SV's robustness, scalability, and practical utility
for efficient LLM inference.

### [135] [AlignX: Advancing Multilingual Large Language Models with Multilingual Representation Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24338)
*Mengyu Bu,Shaolei Zhang,Zhongjun He,Hua Wu,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AlignX是一个两阶段表示级框架，通过多语言语义对齐和指令微调来提升预训练大语言模型的多语言性能，缩小非主导语言的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在非主导语言上的性能和跨语言对齐能力往往不足，现有的大规模多语言语料微调方法存在对齐不精确和知识转移效果有限的问题。

Method: 提出AlignX两阶段框架：第一阶段通过多语言语义对齐和语言特征整合来对齐多语言表示；第二阶段通过多语言指令微调来激发LLM的多语言能力。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法提升了LLM的多语言通用能力和跨语言生成能力，使多语言表示更加接近并改善了跨语言对齐。

Conclusion: AlignX框架有效缩小了多语言性能差距，增强了预训练LLM在多语言任务上的表现。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) possess impressive multilingual
understanding and generation capabilities. However, their performance and
cross-lingual alignment often lag for non-dominant languages. A common solution
is to fine-tune LLMs on large-scale and more balanced multilingual corpus, but
such approaches often lead to imprecise alignment and suboptimal knowledge
transfer, struggling with limited improvements across languages. In this paper,
we propose AlignX to bridge the multilingual performance gap, which is a
two-stage representation-level framework for enhancing multilingual performance
of pre-trained LLMs. In the first stage, we align multilingual representations
with multilingual semantic alignment and language feature integration. In the
second stage, we stimulate the multilingual capability of LLMs via multilingual
instruction fine-tuning. Experimental results on several pre-trained LLMs
demonstrate that our approach enhances LLMs' multilingual general and
cross-lingual generation capability. Further analysis indicates that AlignX
brings the multilingual representations closer and improves the cross-lingual
alignment.

### [136] [Beyond Repetition: Text Simplification and Curriculum Learning for Data-Constrained Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24356)
*Matthew Theodore Roque,Dan John Velasco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究数据受限环境下语言模型预训练，探讨文本复杂度排序和简化数据增强对表示质量的影响。发现添加简化数据能提升微调和零样本性能，小模型适合从低到高复杂度排序，大模型适合交错排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数语言模型预训练研究关注大数据集，而在数据受限环境下，训练数据顺序和包含同一文本的替代版本的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用平行语料库（人类写作段落与LLM简化版本对齐），测试四种数据调度策略：重复暴露、低到高复杂度、高到低复杂度、交错排序。通过微调和零样本任务评估表示质量。

Result: 添加简化数据相比重复使用原始数据能改善微调和零样本性能。小模型从低到高复杂度排序中受益，而大模型在交错排序下表现更好。

Conclusion: 在数据受限的预训练中，数据调度策略对模型性能有显著影响，简化数据增强是有效的策略，且最优排序策略取决于模型规模。

Abstract: Most studies on language model pretraining focus on large datasets, leaving
open questions about optimization in data-constrained settings. In such
settings, the effects of training data order and of including alternative
versions of the same text remain underexplored. We address this by studying
curriculum learning in pretraining, focusing on text-complexity ordering and
data augmentation via simplification. We ask: (1) Does simplifying texts
enhance representation quality more than reusing the original data? and (2)
Does ordering data by text complexity yield better representations? To answer,
we build on a pair of parallel corpora where human-written paragraphs are
aligned with LLM-simplified variants, and test four data schedules: repeated
exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low, and interleaved. We analyze
models' representation quality from a sample efficiency perspective via
fine-tuning, as well as its zero-shot performance on linguistic knowledge,
entity tracking, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our findings show
that adding simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over
a repeated-exposure baseline: smaller models benefit from low-to-high
complexity, while larger models perform better with interleaved ordering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了强化中训练(RMT)作为大语言模型开发的新阶段，通过动态token预算、课程自适应采样和双重训练策略，显著提升性能并减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型开发流程只有预训练和后训练两个阶段，缺乏中间阶段来获得更强的性能提升。

Method: RMT框架包含三个核心组件：动态token预算机制限制不必要推理步骤；课程自适应采样方法实现从易到难的渐进学习；双重训练策略结合强化学习和下一token预测。

Result: 在语言建模中性能提升高达64.91%，同时推理长度减少到仅21%；数学领域后训练性能提升达18.76%。

Conclusion: 强化中训练是有效的中间阶段，能显著提升模型性能并优化训练效率，为后续后训练带来额外收益。

Abstract: The development of state-of-the-art large language models is commonly
understood as a two-stage process involving pre-training and post-training. We
point out the need for an additional intermediate stage called reinforcement
mid-training with potential for strong performance gains. In this paper, we
formally define the problem and identify three key challenges: (1) inefficient
training due to excessive reasoning steps, (2) disregard of the imbalanced
token entropy distribution, and (3) underutilization of token information. To
address these challenges, we propose RMT, a framework for efficient, adaptive,
and unified reinforcement mid-training with various innovative components. In
particular, we first introduce a dynamic token budget mechanism that constrains
unnecessary reasoning steps and mitigates model overthinking. Next, we design a
curriculum-based adaptive sampling method that fosters a progressive learning
trajectory from easy to hard tokens. Finally, we present a dual training
strategy that combines reinforcement learning with next-token prediction,
ensuring targeted learning on key tokens and full exploitation of all token
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RMT over
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +64.91% performance improvement with
only 21% of the reasoning length in language modeling. We also show that
checkpoints obtained after reinforcement mid-training can benefit the
subsequent post-training, yielding up to +18.76% improvement in the
mathematical domain.

TL;DR: 提出了HarmMetric Eval基准，用于系统评估LLM有害性评估指标和评判者的质量，发现传统指标METEOR和ROUGE-1在评估模型响应有害性方面优于基于LLM的评判者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统基准来评估各种有害性评估指标和评判者的质量，这削弱了报告越狱攻击有效性和其他风险的可信度。

Method: 构建包含代表性有害提示与多样化有害/无害模型响应的高质量数据集，并设计兼容多种指标和评判者的灵活评分机制。

Result: 实验发现传统指标METEOR和ROUGE-1在评估模型响应有害性方面优于基于LLM的评判者，挑战了LLM在此领域优越性的普遍认知。

Conclusion: HarmMetric Eval为评估有害性评估指标提供了系统基准，揭示了传统指标在特定任务中的优势，有助于提高LLM安全部署的可信度。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe deployment, yet jailbreak attacks can subvert this alignment to
elicit harmful outputs from LLMs. In recent years, a proliferation of jailbreak
attacks has emerged, accompanied by diverse metrics and judges to assess the
harmfulness of the LLM outputs. However, the absence of a systematic benchmark
to assess the quality and effectiveness of these metrics and judges undermines
the credibility of the reported jailbreak effectiveness and other risks. To
address this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness
metrics and judges. Our benchmark includes a high-quality dataset of
representative harmful prompts paired with diverse harmful and non-harmful
model responses, alongside a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various
metrics and judges. With HarmMetric Eval, our extensive experiments uncover a
surprising result: two conventional metrics--METEOR and ROUGE-1--outperform
LLM-based judges in evaluating the harmfulness of model responses, challenging
prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in this domain. Our dataset is
publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/qusgo/HarmMetric_Eval,

TL;DR: LLaDA-MoE是一个基于混合专家架构的大规模语言扩散模型，在20T token上从头训练，通过仅激活1.4B参数实现高效推理，性能优于之前的扩散语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将稀疏MoE架构集成到掩码扩散语言模型的训练目标中，在保持高效推理的同时发挥MoE的优势，为扩散语言模型探索提供新方向。

Method: 采用混合专家架构，维持7B参数容量但推理时仅激活1.4B参数，从头训练于约20T token，并进行指令调优。

Result: 在多个基准测试中超越LLaDA、LLaDA 1.5和Dream等扩散语言模型，LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct在知识理解、代码生成、数学推理等任务上表现与Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct相当但使用更少激活参数。

Conclusion: MoE架构在扩散语言模型中仍能发挥优势，实现高效推理，为未来扩散语言模型研究开辟了广阔探索空间。

Abstract: We introduce LLaDA-MoE, a large language diffusion model with the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, trained from scratch on approximately
20T tokens. LLaDA-MoE achieves competitive performance with significantly
reduced computational overhead by maintaining a 7B-parameter capacity while
activating only 1.4B parameters during inference. Our empirical evaluation
reveals that LLaDA-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion
language models with larger parameters, surpassing previous diffusion language
models LLaDA, LLaDA 1.5, and Dream across multiple benchmarks. The
instruct-tuned model LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct demonstrates capabilities
comparable to Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct in knowledge understanding, code generation,
mathematical reasoning, agent and alignment tasks, despite using fewer active
parameters. Our results show that integrating a sparse MoE architecture into
the training objective of masked diffusion language models still brings out
MoE's strengths under efficient inference with few active parameters, and opens
ample room for further exploration of diffusion language models. LLaDA-MoE
models are available at Huggingface.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的Text-to-SQL方法在BIRD等挑战性基准测试中仍显著落后于人类专家，现有测试时扩展方法缺乏协调策略且忽视了模型的内部推理过程

Method: 采用协调的测试时扩展策略，结合三个不同视角：通过RL增强的内在推理进行内部扩展、通过迭代精化进行顺序扩展、通过多样化合成和锦标赛选择进行并行扩展

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中达到81.67%的执行准确率，在官方排行榜上排名第一

Conclusion: Agentar-Scale-SQL展示了一条通向人类水平性能的有效路径，是一个易于适应新数据库和更强大语言模型的通用框架

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Text-to-SQL methods still lag significantly behind
human experts on challenging benchmarks like BIRD. Current approaches that
explore test-time scaling lack an orchestrated strategy and neglect the model's
internal reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce Agentar-Scale-SQL,
a novel framework leveraging scalable computation to improve performance.
Agentar-Scale-SQL implements an Orchestrated Test-Time Scaling strategy that
synergistically combines three distinct perspectives: i) Internal Scaling via
RL-enhanced Intrinsic Reasoning, ii) Sequential Scaling through Iterative
Refinement, and iii) Parallel Scaling using Diverse Synthesis and Tournament
Selection. Agentar-Scale-SQL is a general-purpose framework designed for easy
adaptation to new databases and more powerful language models. Extensive
experiments show that Agentar-Scale-SQL achieves SOTA performance on the BIRD
benchmark, reaching 81.67\% execution accuracy on the test set and ranking
first on the official leaderboard, demonstrating an effective path toward
human-level performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL基准主要是英文的，限制了多语言进展。需要创建多语言基准来评估模型在不同语言和方言上的表现。

Method: 扩展Spider 2.0到8种语言（英、德、法、西、葡、日、中、越），保持结构难度同时增加语言和方言变异性。提出协作驱动的语言代理基线，通过迭代优化查询。

Result: 最先进LLMs（如DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI o1）仅达到4%执行准确率，而MultiSpider 1.0上为60%。协作方法将准确率提升至15%。

Conclusion: 存在显著的多语言差距，需要开发跨语言鲁棒的方法以适应实际企业部署需求。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables natural access to databases, yet most benchmarks are
English-only, limiting multilingual progress. We introduce MultiSpider 2.0,
extending Spider 2.0 to eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese). It preserves Spider 2.0's
structural difficulty while adding linguistic and dialectal variability,
demanding deeper reasoning for complex SQL. On this benchmark, state-of-the-art
LLMs (such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1) reach only 4\% execution accuracy when
relying on intrinsic reasoning, versus 60\% on MultiSpider 1.0. Therefore, we
provide a collaboration-driven language agents baseline that iteratively
refines queries, improving accuracy to 15\%. These results reveal a substantial
multilingual gap and motivate methods that are robust across languages and
ready for real-world enterprise deployment. Our benchmark is available at

TL;DR: 提出CDT框架来全面评估大语言模型能力，通过认知-领域-任务三个维度进行综合测量，并应用于数据集能力评估和数据选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往只关注孤立能力，缺乏评估LLM能力的整体框架，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出Cognition-Domain-Task(CDT)框架，结合Cattell-Horn-Carroll认知理论，在认知层面扩展模型能力定义，应用于数据集能力评估和数据选择。

Result: 能力指标与下游性能相关性良好，在数据选择实验中，通用和特定基准分别达到44.3和45.4分，比基线提高1.6和2.2分。

Conclusion: CDT框架在模型能力评估和数据选择方面具有有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
their capabilities, highlighting the need for comprehensive evaluation
frameworks that extend beyond task-specific benchmarks. However, existing
benchmarks often focus on isolated abilities, lacking a holistic framework for
assessing LLM capabilities. To address this gap, we propose the
Cognition-Domain-Task (CDT) framework, which comprehensively measures a model's
capabilities across three dimensions. We expand the scope of model capability
definitions at the cognitive level by incorporating the Cattell-Horn-Carroll
cognitive theory, refining the categorization of model capabilities. We apply
CDT in two directions: dataset capability evaluation and data selection.
Experiments show that our capability metrics correlate well with downstream
performance and can support effective dataset analysis and construction. The
experiments on data selection also show significant improvements in both
general and specific benchmarks, achieving scores of 44.3 and 45.4, with an
increase of 1.6 and 2.2 points over the baselines, respectively. These results
validate the effectiveness and practicality of CDT. Source code and models are

TL;DR: 本调查论文系统梳理了下一代语言模型的替代范式，将现有方法分为五大类，旨在解决传统下一个词预测(NTP)的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统下一个词预测(NTP)范式虽然推动了LLM的成功，但也导致了长期规划能力差、错误累积和计算效率低等固有问题，需要探索替代方案。

Method: 将替代方法分为五类：(1)多词预测；(2)先规划后生成；(3)潜在推理；(4)连续生成方法；(5)非Transformer架构。

Result: 建立了一个分类体系，为研究超越词级生成局限性的新型模型提供了指导框架。

Conclusion: 通过系统分类现有替代方法，为开发能够克服NTP局限性的变革性NLP模型提供了研究路线图。

Abstract: The paradigm of Next Token Prediction (NTP) has driven the unprecedented
success of Large Language Models (LLMs), but is also the source of their most
persistent weaknesses such as poor long-term planning, error accumulation, and
computational inefficiency. Acknowledging the growing interest in exploring
alternatives to NTP, the survey describes the emerging ecosystem of
alternatives to NTP. We categorise these approaches into five main families:
(1) Multi-Token Prediction, which targets a block of future tokens instead of a
single one; (2) Plan-then-Generate, where a global, high-level plan is created
upfront to guide token-level decoding; (3) Latent Reasoning, which shifts the
autoregressive process itself into a continuous latent space; (4) Continuous
Generation Approaches, which replace sequential generation with iterative,
parallel refinement through diffusion, flow matching, or energy-based methods;
and (5) Non-Transformer Architectures, which sidestep NTP through their
inherent model structure. By synthesizing insights across these methods, this
survey offers a taxonomy to guide research into models that address the known
limitations of token-level generation to develop new transformative models for
natural language processing.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SOBACO基准测试，用于评估日语LLMs中的社会偏见和文化常识，发现去偏见方法会显著降低LLMs在文化常识任务上的性能（准确率下降高达75%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏见方法主要评估对通用语言理解能力的影响，但文化常识与社会偏见密切相关，两者都源于社会规范和价值观。去偏见方法对LLMs文化常识的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出SOBACO（社会偏见和文化常识基准测试），这是一个日语基准测试，以统一格式评估LLMs中的社会偏见和文化常识。评估了多个LLMs在SOBACO上的表现，研究去偏见方法如何影响文化常识。

Result: 去偏见方法显著降低了LLMs在文化常识任务上的性能，准确率下降高达75%。

Conclusion: 开发去偏见方法时需要权衡文化常识的保留，以提高LLMs的公平性和实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases, prompting the development
of various debiasing methods. However, debiasing methods may degrade the
capabilities of LLMs. Previous research has evaluated the impact of bias
mitigation primarily through tasks measuring general language understanding,
which are often unrelated to social biases. In contrast, cultural commonsense
is closely related to social biases, as both are rooted in social norms and
values. The impact of bias mitigation on cultural commonsense in LLMs has not
been well investigated. Considering this gap, we propose SOBACO (SOcial BiAs
and Cultural cOmmonsense benchmark), a Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate
social biases and cultural commonsense in LLMs in a unified format. We evaluate
several LLMs on SOBACO to examine how debiasing methods affect cultural
commonsense in LLMs. Our results reveal that the debiasing methods degrade the
performance of the LLMs on the cultural commonsense task (up to 75% accuracy
deterioration). These results highlight the importance of developing debiasing
methods that consider the trade-off with cultural commonsense to improve
fairness and utility of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音识别评估指标（如词错误率）主要受高频词影响，而罕见词、命名实体和领域特定词汇的错误更具语义重要性但被聚合指标掩盖，需要更精细的错误分析。

Method: 开发了一种结合动态规划和波束搜索评分的新型对齐算法，相比传统文本对齐方法能更准确地定位个体错误。

Result: 该算法能够提供更准确的错误对齐，支持可靠的错误分析，已通过PyPI发布。

Conclusion: 提出的对齐算法解决了传统方法在精细错误分析中的局限性，为语音识别系统的改进提供了更好的诊断工具。

Abstract: Modern neural networks have greatly improved performance across speech
recognition benchmarks. However, gains are often driven by frequent words with
limited semantic weight, which can obscure meaningful differences in word error
rate, the primary evaluation metric. Errors in rare terms, named entities, and
domain-specific vocabulary are more consequential, but remain hidden by
aggregate metrics. This highlights the need for finer-grained error analysis,
which depends on accurate alignment between reference and model transcripts.
However, conventional alignment methods are not designed for such precision. We
propose a novel alignment algorithm that couples dynamic programming with beam
search scoring. Compared to traditional text alignment methods, our approach
provides more accurate alignment of individual errors, enabling reliable error
analysis. The algorithm is made available via PyPI.

Conclusion: Self-Sanitize为更安全的LLM部署提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案，支持实时流式监控和无缝修复。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide
range of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding
the generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite
significant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards,
adversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses.
Existing mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering,
which introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is
incompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce
Self-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive
psychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during
conversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that
continuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level
via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place
correction of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues.
This design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with
negligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that
privacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous
studies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy
leakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior
mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility
of LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出GRPO-MA方法解决GRPO算法在训练思维链推理时的三个挑战：思维与答案的梯度耦合、稀疏奖励信号和优势估计不稳定。通过每个思维过程生成多个答案来降低优势方差，提高训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GRPO算法在训练思维链推理时面临的三个主要挑战：梯度耦合问题、稀疏奖励信号和优势估计不稳定，这些限制了训练效率和模型性能。

Method: 提出GRPO-MA方法，通过每个思维过程生成多个答案，利用多答案生成来降低思维优势的方差，实现更稳健和高效的优化。

Result: 理论分析表明思维优势方差随每个思维的答案数量增加而降低。实验验证GRPO-MA减少了梯度尖峰，在数学、代码和多模态任务上显著提升了性能和训练效率。消融研究显示增加每个思维的答案数量能持续提升模型性能。

Conclusion: GRPO-MA通过多答案生成有效解决了GRPO的局限性，提供了更稳定和高效的思维链推理训练方法，在多个任务上表现出显著性能提升。

Abstract: Recent progress, such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that the GRPO algorithm, a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, can effectively train Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling
between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel
sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we
propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages
multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and
efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought
advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases.
Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA
reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and
diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves
performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that
increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model
performance.

TL;DR: SUIT方法通过识别和修改与编辑相关的关键特征子空间，显著减少了知识编辑对语言模型的扰动，在保持高编辑效果的同时大幅提升了知识保留能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识编辑方法在修改MLP层时缺乏对关键向量和值向量的约束，导致对编辑模型产生显著扰动。

Method: 提出SUIT方法，识别并仅修改与编辑相关的关键特征子空间，而不是整个MLP层。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B、GPT-J-6B和Qwen2.5-7B模型上的实验表明，SUIT在保持高编辑效果的同时，显著改善了知识保留能力。

Conclusion: SUIT成功识别了编辑的关键子空间，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently correct factual errors in Language
Models (LMs). The popular locate-then-edit approach modifies an MLP layer by
finding an optimal mapping between its input vector (key) and output vector
(value) that leads to the expression of the edited knowledge. However, existing
methods without any constraints on the key and value vectors cause significant
perturbations to the edited model. To address this, we propose Subspace
Knowledge Edit (SUIT), a method that identifies and modifies only the subspace
of critical features relevant to the edit. Our empirical results on LLaMA-3-8B,
GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B models show that SUIT dramatically improves knowledge
preservation over strong baselines while maintaining high edit efficacy. This
effectiveness confirms that SUIT successfully identifies the critical subspace
for the edit. Further analyses provide additional validation for our approach.
The source code and data will be released to the public upon publication of the
paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的评估通常缺乏对最终用户现实生活的关注，特别是在医疗等关键领域需要超越人工或模拟任务，反映社区的日常需求、文化实践和细微情境。

Method: 与民间组织和社区成员合作，通过社区驱动的流程进行可扩展的自动化基准测试，社区反馈指导评估内容、基准构建方式和输出评分标准。

Result: 在印度医疗领域展示了该方法，分析了当前多语言大型语言模型处理细微社区健康查询的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为大型语言模型提供了情境基础和包容性评估的可扩展路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated through general or
domain-specific benchmarks testing capabilities that often lack grounding in
the lived realities of end users. Critical domains such as healthcare require
evaluations that extend beyond artificial or simulated tasks to reflect the
everyday needs, cultural practices, and nuanced contexts of communities. We
propose Samiksha, a community-driven evaluation pipeline co-created with
civil-society organizations (CSOs) and community members. Our approach enables
scalable, automated benchmarking through a culturally aware, community-driven
pipeline in which community feedback informs what to evaluate, how the
benchmark is built, and how outputs are scored. We demonstrate this approach in
the health domain in India. Our analysis highlights how current multilingual
LLMs address nuanced community health queries, while also offering a scalable
pathway for contextually grounded and inclusive LLM evaluation.

TL;DR: AdaThink-Med是一个端到端框架，通过不确定性引导的长度校准来增强医学LLMs的自适应思维能力，在保持性能的同时显著减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学LLMs无论问题难易都进行冗长推理，导致实际应用中的推理成本增加，需要开发能够根据问题难度自适应调整推理深度的模型。

Method: 首先生成多个候选输出，评估每个候选的正确性和不确定性，然后通过不确定性引导的长度校准模块估计问题难度，对简单问题惩罚长推理路径，对复杂问题鼓励扩展思维链。

Result: 在六个公共医学QA基准测试中，AdaThink-Med平均实现了6.4倍的推理长度减少，同时性能仅有最小程度的下降。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了医学LLMs的自适应推理能力，并自发发展出"非思考"和"思考"两种推理模式，能够动态抑制冗余推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought
have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and
medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in
lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question,
leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore,
enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and
think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs
in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches
designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while
providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and
computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first
end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical
reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first
generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the
correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem
difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs
with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer
reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers,
it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions.
On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length
reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation.
Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct
reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking",
demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes
dynamically.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统研究阅读障碍的方法在检验因果假设方面存在局限，需要新的计算框架来研究阅读障碍的潜在机制。

Method: 在视觉语言模型中识别视觉词汇形式选择性单元，并对其进行针对性消融，同时保持随机单元不变作为对照。

Result: 针对性消融视觉词汇形式选择性单元会导致阅读任务选择性受损，而一般视觉和语言理解能力保持完整，这与阅读障碍患者的语音缺陷模式一致。

Conclusion: 该建模结果复制了阅读障碍的关键特征，为研究阅读障碍建立了计算框架。

Abstract: Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading
difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area
in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying
dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable
insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about
the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use
large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally
identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using
stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective
units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike
ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while
general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In
particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits
without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our
modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a
computational framework for investigating reading disorders.

Motivation: 尽管多语言自动语音识别(ASR)有所进展，但语码转换(CS)在日常语音中常见的语言混合现象仍然是一个严重未被充分探索的挑战，特别是在韩英语码转换领域缺乏评估框架。

Method: 构建HiKE基准测试框架，包含高质量自然语码转换数据、借词标签和分层CS级别标注方案（词级、短语级和句子级），通过评估多样化多语言ASR模型和微调实验来验证框架有效性。

Result: 评估表明大多数多语言ASR模型在初始阶段难以处理CS-ASR任务，但通过使用CS数据进行微调可以显著提升其语码转换处理能力。

Conclusion: HiKE框架为韩英语码转换研究提供了首个系统评估工具，证明了通过CS数据微调可以激活多语言ASR模型的语码转换能力，将促进该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: Despite advances in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR),
code-switching (CS), the mixing of languages within an utterance common in
daily speech, remains a severely underexplored challenge. In this paper, we
introduce HiKE: the Hierarchical Korean-English code-switching benchmark, the
first globally accessible evaluation framework for Korean-English CS, aiming to
provide a means for the precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and to
foster research in the field. The proposed framework not only consists of
high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides
meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word,
phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's
ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of
diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper
demonstrates that while most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with
CS-ASR, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data. HiKE

Method: 制定识别夸大语言的正式标注指南，在NIH基金申请语料库上进行标注，评估传统文本分类器和语言模型的性能，并与人类基准进行比较。

Conclusion: 该任务具有语言复杂性，可能需要领域知识和时间事实意识。这是首次将夸大检测作为自然语言处理任务进行研究。

Abstract: In science, promotional language ('hype') is increasing and can undermine
objective evaluation of evidence, impede research development, and erode trust
in science. In this paper, we introduce the task of automatic detection of
hype, which we define as hyperbolic or subjective language that authors use to
glamorize, promote, embellish, or exaggerate aspects of their research. We
propose formalized guidelines for identifying hype language and apply them to
annotate a portion of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant application
corpus. We then evaluate traditional text classifiers and language models on
this task, comparing their performance with a human baseline. Our experiments
show that formalizing annotation guidelines can help humans reliably annotate
candidate hype adjectives and that using our annotated dataset to train machine
learning models yields promising results. Our findings highlight the linguistic
complexity of the task, and the potential need for domain knowledge and
temporal awareness of the facts. While some linguistic works address hype
detection, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach it as a
natural language processing task.

Motivation: 标准Transformer的自注意力机制在处理长序列时面临计算和内存瓶颈，现有可训练稀疏注意力方法引入过多额外参数并破坏预训练-微调流程。

Method: 提出密集-稀疏可切换注意力框架，通过参数免费架构修改复用密集注意力参数，短序列使用密集注意力，长序列平滑切换到稀疏注意力。

Result: 实验表明InfLLM-V2比密集注意力快4倍，在长上下文理解和思维链推理任务中分别保持98.1%和99.7%的性能。

Conclusion: InfLLM-V2有效解决了长序列处理的计算效率问题，并基于此框架训练开源了MiniCPM4.1混合推理模型。

Abstract: Long-sequence processing is a critical capability for modern large language
models. However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer
architecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing
long sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising
solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters
and disrupt the conventional \textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long}
workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention
framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that
seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2
reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture
modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence
processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all
sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly
transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical
acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2
that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on
long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that
InfLLM-V2 is 4$\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and
99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we
have trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1
(https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model,
providing a reproducible implementation for the research community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了unPact框架，通过提示归因和贡献追踪来解释LLM遗忘机制，发现现有遗忘方法存在两难困境：要么知识仍可通过关键词强调恢复，要么因灾难性遗忘导致通用性能崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM遗忘方法的效果存在争议，一方面"遗忘"的知识可以通过微调恢复，另一方面遗忘可能导致灾难性遗忘。由于难以追踪LLM复杂架构中的知识，缺乏对遗忘机制的可解释性分析。

Method: 提出unPact框架，通过量化提示中每个token对输出的影响，进行遗忘前后的比较分析。在6种主流遗忘方法、3个LLM和3个基准测试上进行评估。

Result: 发现：(1)遗忘通过破坏对提示关键词的关注而显得有效；(2)大部分知识并未真正擦除，仅通过强调关键词即可恢复；(3)灾难性遗忘源于对所有token的无差别惩罚。

Conclusion: 现有遗忘方法面临两难困境：要么不足够有效（知识可通过关键词强调恢复），要么过于破坏性（因灾难性遗忘导致通用性能崩溃），距离可靠的遗忘仍有差距。

Abstract: Unlearning seeks to remove specific knowledge from large language models
(LLMs), but its effectiveness remains contested. On one side, "forgotten"
knowledge can often be recovered through interventions such as light
fine-tuning; on the other side, unlearning may induce catastrophic forgetting
that degrades general capabilities. Despite active exploration of unlearning
methods, interpretability analyses of the mechanism are scarce due to the
difficulty of tracing knowledge in LLMs' complex architectures. We address this
gap by proposing unPact, an interpretable framework for unlearning via prompt
attribution and contribution tracking. Typically, it quantifies each prompt
token's influence on outputs, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons to
reveal what changes. Across six mainstream unlearning methods, three LLMs, and
three benchmarks, we find that: (1) Unlearning appears to be effective by
disrupting focus on keywords in prompt; (2) Much of the knowledge is not truly
erased and can be recovered by simply emphasizing these keywords in prompts,
without modifying the model's weights; (3) Catastrophic forgetting arises from
indiscriminate penalization of all tokens. Taken together, our results suggest
an unlearning dilemma: existing methods tend either to be insufficient -
knowledge remains recoverable by keyword emphasis, or overly destructive -
general performance collapses due to catastrophic forgetting, still leaving a
gap to reliable unlearning.

TL;DR: 本文研究无参考文本的LLM评分可靠性问题，提出了Latent Judges方法，通过内部模型信号获得更稳定、细粒度的确定性评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为评判者的单次响应评分存在不稳定性和校准问题，导致评分压缩和频繁平局，需要更可靠的参考免费评估方法。

Method: 提出三种潜在评判方法：(i)基于整数评分的概率加权分数，(ii)验证器式的"是"概率，(iii)在评分位置训练线性探针的模型激活分析。

Result: 在广泛的成对和单评分基准测试中，潜在方法匹配或超越标准提示方法，在成对准确性和列表排序方面表现一致提升。概率加权分数在单评分相关性方面最强，探针方法在输出logits校准不良时能恢复有用信号。

Conclusion: 潜在信息为参考免费评估提供了确定性和更具区分度的信号，可以改进Best-of-N选择、多教师蒸馏和路由等选择与训练方法。

Abstract: How reliable are single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings without references,
and can we obtain fine-grained, deterministic scores in this setting? We study
the common practice of asking a judge model to assign Likert-scale scores to
free-text responses and show two systematic issues: scores are unstable under
sampling and poorly calibrated, leading to compression near the top of the
scale and frequent ties. We then propose and evaluate Latent Judges, which
derive scalar ratings from internal model signals: (i) probability-weighted
scores over integer ratings, (ii) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and
(iii) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position. Across
a broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or
surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and
listwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection. Probability-weighted scores
achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful
signals when output logits are miscalibrated. These results indicate that
latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for
reference-free evaluation, and can improve selection and training approaches
like Best-of-$N$, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.

Motivation: 现有记忆范式存在局限：参数化记忆强制调整模型参数，检索式记忆将经验外部化到结构化数据库中，都无法模拟人类认知中推理与记忆的流畅交织

Method: MemGen包含记忆触发器（监控智能体推理状态决定显式记忆调用）和记忆编织器（以智能体当前状态为刺激构建潜在token序列作为机器原生记忆来丰富推理）

Result: 在8个基准测试中，MemGen超越领先的外部记忆系统ExpeL和AWM达38.22%，超过GRPO达13.44%，并表现出强大的跨领域泛化能力

Conclusion: MemGen在没有显式监督的情况下自发演化出类似人类的记忆能力，包括规划记忆、程序记忆和工作记忆，表明机器认知向更自然形式发展的新兴轨迹

Abstract: Agent memory shapes how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, akin to
the human brain, progressively refine themselves through environment
interactions. Existing paradigms remain constrained: parametric memory forcibly
adjusts model parameters, and retrieval-based memory externalizes experience
into structured databases, yet neither captures the fluid interweaving of
reasoning and memory that underlies human cognition. To address this gap, we
propose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a
human-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \textit{memory trigger}, which
monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and
a \textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to
construct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its
reasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent
memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and
cognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen
surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to
$38.22\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization ability. More importantly, we find that without explicit
supervision, MemGen spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties,
including planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, suggesting an
emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.

Conclusion: Socratic-Zero框架能够自主生成高质量训练数据，显著提升模型性能，并证明了合成数据可以超越商业LLM的表现。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks rely
heavily on massive, high-quality datasets-typically human-annotated and thus
difficult to scale. While data synthesis or distillation offers a promising
alternative, existing methods struggle with inconsistent data quality and an
inability to dynamically adapt to the evolving capabilities of the model,
leading to suboptimal training signals. To address these limitations, we
introduce Socratic-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
high-quality training data from minimal seed examples through the co-evolution
of three agents: the Teacher, the Solver, and the Generator. The Solver
continuously refines its reasoning by learning from preference feedback on both
successful and failed trajectories; the Teacher adaptively crafts increasingly
challenging questions based on the Solver's weaknesses; and the Generator
distills the Teacher's question-design strategy to enable scalable,
high-fidelity curriculum generation. This closed-loop system produces a
self-improving curriculum-requiring no pre-existing tasks or labels.
Remarkably, starting from only 100 seed questions, our Socratic-Solver-8B
achieves an average gain of +20.2 percentage points over prior data synthesis
methods across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24-25,
Olympiad, MATH-500, Minerva, and GSM8K), with consistent gains on both Qwen3
and GLM4 series models. Even more surprisingly, synthetic data from
Socratic-Generator-32B enables student LLMs to achieve superior performance
compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) commercial LLMs on these benchmarks,
including Qwen3-235B-A22B, DeepSeek-V3.1-671B, GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4,

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms limits the efficiency of
Large Language Models (LLMs) on long-text tasks. Recently, methods that
dynamically estimate block importance have enabled efficient block sparse
attention, leading to significant acceleration in long-text pre-filling of
LLMs. However, their coarse-grained estimation inevitably leads to performance
degradation at high sparsity rates. In this work, we propose ProxyAttn, a
training-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block
estimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads. Based on our
observation of the similarity among multiple attention heads, we use the scores
of pooled representative heads to approximate the scores for all heads. To
account for the varying sparsity among heads, we also propose a block-aware
dynamic budget estimation method. By combining the scores from representative
proxy heads with multi-head dynamic budgets, we achieve a more fine-grained
block importance evaluation at low computational cost. Experiments on a variety
of mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity
among attention heads. Leveraging a fine-grained estimation, the proposed
method achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to
existing methods. More precisely, ProxyAttn can achieve up to 10.3x attention
acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance
loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/wyxstriker/ProxyAttn.

TL;DR: 提出了LatentEvolve框架，通过模拟人类互补学习系统，让LLM在推理阶段自我进化学习如何更有效地进行测试时计算缩放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法相互独立，LLM未能进化学习如何更有效地进行缩放计算。受人类大脑互补学习系统启发，希望让LLM能够渐进式学习缩放策略。

Method: 基于CLS理论的双组件框架：白天缩放快速检索历史潜在表征指导当前推理；夜间缩放整合过去潜在优化，模拟人脑睡眠中的经验巩固。通过昼夜交替实现快速和慢速进化。

Result: 在8个基准测试和5个模型骨干上的实验表明，LatentEvolve超越最先进的TTS方法（如LatentSeek和TTRL）达13.33%，并展现出优异的跨领域和跨骨干泛化能力。

Conclusion: LatentEvolve成功实现了LLM在测试时计算缩放方面的自我进化学习，模拟了人类认知动态，在完全无监督的方式下显著提升了推理能力。

Abstract: Test-time Scaling (TTS) has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during the inference
phase without altering model parameters. However, existing TTS methods are
largely independent, implying that LLMs have not yet evolved to progressively
learn how to scale more effectively. With the objective of evolving LLMs to
learn ``how to scale test-time computation,'' we propose LatentEvolve, a
self-evolving latent TTS framework inspired by the complementary learning
system (CLS) theory. Analogous to the human brain's dual system of a
fast-recall hippocampus and a slow-consolidating neocortex, LatentEvolve
comprises two evolutionary components: \textit{daytime scaling}, which rapidly
retrieves historical latent representations to better guide current LLM
reasoning; and \textit{nighttime scaling}, which integrates past latent
optimizations in a manner akin to the human brain's consolidation of
experiences during sleep. The alternation of daytime and nighttime processes
facilitates a fast and slow evolution of LLM TTS, mirroring human cognitive
dynamics in a fully unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks and five model backbones demonstrate that our LatentEvolve surpasses
state-of-the-art TTS methods such as LatentSeek and TTRL by up to $13.33\%$ and
exhibits exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeaPO是一种战略错误放大方法，通过在模型偏好优化中引入三种常见错误模式，确保负样本比正样本更错误，从而增强偏好学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法在LLM偏好优化中，由于模型评分或生成能力有限，正负样本质量可能趋于相似，这给偏好学习优化带来困难。

Method: 利用LLM中常见的三种错误类型，在模型偏好优化中引入特定错误模式，确保负样本比正样本更错误，并通过基于偏好的训练来减少这些错误。

Result: 在五个能力维度和不同模型规模（1.5B到14B）上的评估显示，生成的数据显著提升了整体模型性能，特别是在真实性方面有5-10个百分点的提升。

Conclusion: 任务性能取决于引入的错误类型：注入最常见错误类型能提升相关任务性能，而混合错误类型则带来更广泛的性能提升，大多数任务稳定改进，部分任务显著提升。

Abstract: Existing alignment methods for preference optimization of large language
models (LLMs) aim to enhance model performance by utilizing pairs of positive
and negative samples. However, due to the limited capacity of models in scoring
or generating responses, the quality of positive and negative samples may
become similar during training, which complicates optimization for preference
learning. To address this issue, we introduce SeaPO, a Strategic Error
Amplification method that leverages three error types commonly occurring in
LLMs to introduce specific error patterns into the model Preference
Optimization. This strategy ensures that negative samples are more erroneous
than positive samples and preference-based training is employed to mitigate the
occurrence of these errors, thereby enhancing model performance. Evaluations
across five capability dimensions and different model scales (1.5B to 14B)
demonstrate that the generated data significantly improved overall model
performance, particularly in terms of truthfulness, with improvements of 5-10
percentage points observed. Further analysis reveals that task performance
varies depending on the error types introduced. Injecting the most common error
types improves performance in related tasks, while a mix of error types leads
to a broader performance enhancement: most tasks show stable improvements,
while a few tasks exhibit significant gains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于树结构的自动评估指标，用于评估LLM生成的分步组装指令，相比BLEU和BERT相似度等传统指标能更准确反映时空构建特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本相似度指标无法有效评估组装指令的时空合理性，需要开发能更好反映实际构建过程的评估方法。

Method: 开发基于树结构的自动评估指标，应用于缝纫指令领域，通过树形结构捕捉指令的时空特性。

Result: 新指标与人工标注的错误计数和人类质量评分相关性更好，且在对抗性反例测试中比传统方法更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 提出的树基评估指标在评估缝纫指令时空合理性方面优于传统文本相似度指标，具有更好的实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel, automatic tree-based evaluation metric for
LLM-generated step-by-step assembly instructions, that more accurately reflects
spatiotemporal aspects of construction than traditional metrics such as BLEU
and BERT similarity scores. We apply our proposed metric to the domain of
sewing instructions, and show that our metric better correlates with
manually-annotated error counts as well as human quality ratings, demonstrating
our metric's superiority for evaluating the spatiotemporal soundness of sewing
instructions. Further experiments show that our metric is more robust than
traditional approaches against artificially-constructed counterfactual examples
that are specifically constructed to confound metrics that rely on textual
similarity.

TL;DR: KnowGuard是一个新的"调查-再弃权"范式，通过系统化的知识图谱探索来改善临床决策中的弃权机制，提高诊断准确性并减少不必要的交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在医学场景中缺乏有效的弃权机制，经常在信息不足时给出过度自信的回答。传统弃权方法仅依赖模型自我评估，缺乏基于外部医学证据的系统化知识边界识别策略。

Method: 提出KnowGuard方法，包含两个关键阶段：1)证据发现阶段，通过图谱扩展和直接检索系统探索医学知识空间；2)证据评估阶段，使用多因素对证据进行排序，根据患者背景和对话历史自适应调整探索策略。

Result: 在开放式多轮临床基准测试中，KnowGuard优于最先进的弃权方法，诊断准确性提高3.93%，同时平均减少7.27次不必要的交互。

Conclusion: KnowGuard通过系统化的知识图谱探索实现了有效的临床决策弃权机制，能够识别医学证据不足的情况，在准确性和效率之间取得更好的平衡。

Abstract: In clinical practice, physicians refrain from making decisions when patient
information is insufficient. This behavior, known as abstention, is a critical
safety mechanism preventing potentially harmful misdiagnoses. Recent
investigations have reported the application of large language models (LLMs) in
medical scenarios. However, existing LLMs struggle with the abstentions,
frequently providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information.
This limitation stems from conventional abstention methods relying solely on
model self-assessments, which lack systematic strategies to identify knowledge
boundaries with external medical evidences. To address this, we propose
\textbf{KnowGuard}, a novel \textit{investigate-before-abstain} paradigm that
integrates systematic knowledge graph exploration for clinical decision-making.
Our approach consists of two key stages operating on a shared contextualized
evidence pool: 1) an evidence discovery stage that systematically explores the
medical knowledge space through graph expansion and direct retrieval, and 2) an
evidence evaluation stage that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt
exploration based on patient context and conversation history. This two-stage
approach enables systematic knowledge graph exploration, allowing models to
trace structured reasoning paths and recognize insufficient medical evidence.
We evaluate our abstention approach using open-ended multi-round clinical
benchmarks that mimic realistic diagnostic scenarios, assessing abstention
quality through accuracy-efficiency trade-offs beyond existing closed-form
evaluations. Experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that KnowGuard
outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic
accuracy by 3.93\% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on
average.

TL;DR: DiaCDM是首个在对话场景中进行认知诊断的模型，通过改编教育理论中的IRE框架和开发基于图的编码方法，显著提高了诊断准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知诊断模型无法处理动态、非结构化的师生对话，且难以从冗长对话中准确提取诊断语义，需要专门针对对话场景的解决方案。

Method: 改编教育理论中的IRE（发起-回应-评价）框架设计对话诊断框架，开发基于图的编码方法整合教师问题和相关知识组件，以更精确捕捉关键信息。

Result: 在三个真实对话数据集上的实验表明，DiaCDM显著提高了诊断准确性，同时增强了结果的可解释性。

Conclusion: DiaCDM为教师评估学生认知状态提供了强大工具，是对话场景中认知诊断的首个探索，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: While cognitive diagnosis (CD) effectively assesses students' knowledge
mastery from structured test data, applying it to real-world teacher-student
dialogues presents two fundamental challenges. Traditional CD models lack a
suitable framework for handling dynamic, unstructured dialogues, and it's
difficult to accurately extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy dialogues. To
overcome these hurdles, we propose DiaCDM, an innovative model. We've adapted
the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to
design a diagnostic framework tailored for dialogue. We also developed a unique
graph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant
knowledge components to capture key information more precisely. To our
knowledge, this is the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in a dialogue
setting. Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets confirm that DiaCDM
not only significantly improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances the
results' interpretability, providing teachers with a powerful tool for
assessing students' cognitive states. The code is available at

*Xinye Zhao,Spyridon Mastorakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemShareKV是一个KV缓存共享和压缩框架，通过重用语义相似提示的KV缓存来加速LLM推理，使用局部敏感哈希进行模糊令牌匹配，结合旋转位置嵌入保持位置信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模扩大，推理过程中键值缓存的存储占用已成为显著瓶颈。现有方法主要关注单提示内的压缩或跨提示共享前缀，但在语义相似但词汇不同的场景中效果有限。

Method: 应用局部敏感哈希对令牌嵌入进行模糊令牌匹配，结合旋转位置嵌入更好地保留位置信息，选择性重用参考提示缓存中的相关键值对。

Result: 在多样化摘要数据集上实验显示，5k令牌输入时达到6.25倍加速和42% GPU内存降低，质量退化可忽略。

Conclusion: 语义感知缓存共享在高效LLM推理方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the memory footprint of
key-value (KV) caches during inference has become a significant bottleneck.
Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single
prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across
prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are
semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks
such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose
\textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that
accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts.
Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token
matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and
incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional
information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference
prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining
output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to
6.25$\times$ speedup and 42\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with
negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of
semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在专业领域表现不佳，最先进模型在医疗编码任务中准确率仅45.9%，需要解决领域特定的AI局限性

Method: 分层错误校正框架：分析四个专业领域的错误模式，发现错误遵循知识层(58.4%)、推理层(39.6%)和复杂度层(2.0%)的层次结构，据此开发三阶段校正框架

Result: 在医疗转录、法律文档分类、政治偏见检测和法律推理任务中验证，平均提升11.2个百分点(p<0.001)，但在高基线任务(>75%准确率)中效果有限

Conclusion: 系统错误分析可指导专业领域AI增强策略，特别适用于中等基线任务，同时需要理解框架边界以实现最优部署

Abstract: Large Language Models face significant performance challenges in specialized
domains, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 45.9% accuracy on medical
coding tasks. This study proposes a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC)
framework that addresses domain-specific AI limitations through systematic
error analysis and targeted intervention strategies.
  We analyze error patterns across four specialized domains and find that AI
errors follow consistent hierarchical structures: Knowledge-layer errors
(58.4%), Reasoning-layer errors (39.6%), and Complexity-layer errors (2.0%).
Based on these patterns, we develop a three-stage correction framework that
addresses errors according to their hierarchical importance and demonstrates
that framework effectiveness correlates inversely with baseline task
performance.
  Experimental validation across medical transcription (4,921 cases), legal
document classification (1,000 cases), political bias detection (645 cases),
and legal reasoning (1,000 cases) shows consistent improvements. Cross-model
validation across five LLM architectures demonstrates average improvements of
11.2 percentage points (p < 0.001). However, analysis reveals framework
limitations in high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy), where hierarchical
intervention may interfere with effective reasoning processes.
  The results suggest that systematic error analysis can guide effective AI
enhancement strategies in specialized domains, particularly for
moderate-baseline tasks, while highlighting the importance of understanding
framework boundaries for optimal deployment.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在心理健康危机检测和响应方面的能力，发现虽然LLMs在处理明确危机披露时表现一致可靠，但在处理间接风险信号时存在系统性弱点，且存在不当或有害回应的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT等LLM聊天机器人在高风险心理健康支持领域的广泛应用，亟需评估其在检测和响应心理健康危机方面的安全性和有效性，但目前缺乏统一的危机分类体系、标注基准和基于临床最佳实践的实证评估。

Method: 引入六个临床知情心理健康危机类别的统一分类法，策划多样化评估数据集，建立专家设计的响应适当性评估协议，系统性地对三个最先进的LLM进行危机类型分类和生成安全适当响应的基准测试。

Result: LLMs在处理明确危机披露时高度一致且总体可靠，但仍有相当比例的不当或有害回应，开源模型比商业模型失败率更高。系统弱点包括处理间接风险信号困难、依赖公式化默认回复、与用户情境频繁不匹配。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LLM部署中迫切需要加强安全防护、改进危机检测和情境感知干预。该分类法、数据集和评估框架为AI驱动心理健康支持的持续研究和负责任创新奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread use of chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) such
as ChatGPT and Llama has fundamentally reshaped how people seek information and
advice across domains. Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in
high-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns.
While LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and
respond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is
hampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated
benchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In
this work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six
clinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse
evaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing
response appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art
LLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate
responses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and
generally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks
remain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or
harmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher
failure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify
systemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance
on formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with
user context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced
safeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM
deployments. Our taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework lay the
groundwork for ongoing research and responsible innovation in AI-driven mental
health support, helping to minimize harm and better protect vulnerable users.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用大语言模型自动识别文本中的隐喻，比较了检索增强生成、提示工程和微调三种方法，发现微调方法能达到0.79的中位F1分数，表明LLM可以部分自动化隐喻识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐喻是话语中的普遍特征，是研究认知、情感和意识形态的重要视角，但由于其语境敏感性，大规模分析一直受限于需要人工标注。

Method: 比较了三种方法：(1)检索增强生成(RAG)，提供代码书让模型基于规则和示例标注；(2)提示工程，设计特定任务的语言指令；(3)微调，在人工标注文本上训练模型。在提示工程中还测试了零样本、少样本和思维链策略。

Result: 最先进的闭源LLM能达到高准确率，微调方法的中位F1分数为0.79。人类和LLM输出的差异大多是系统性的，反映了隐喻理论中已知的灰色区域和概念挑战。

Conclusion: LLM可以至少部分自动化隐喻识别，并可作为开发和改进隐喻识别协议及其理论基础的工具。

Abstract: Metaphor is a pervasive feature of discourse and a powerful lens for
examining cognition, emotion, and ideology. Large-scale analysis, however, has
been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive
nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare
three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is
provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules
and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal
instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded
texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot,
few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that
state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning
yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs
reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey
areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be
used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a
testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the
theory that underpins them.

TL;DR: 研究表明语言模型可以在推理阶段利用人工插入的填充标记序列作为额外计算空间，提升问题解决能力，特别是在较小模型中效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型是否能在推理阶段利用人工插入的填充标记序列作为额外计算空间，而不需要训练特殊标记。

Method: 首先识别有效的标记类型、数量和插入位置，然后分析模型在训练过程中何时开始利用扩展的计算空间，最后通过注意力图分析这些空间内的动态。

Result: 实验显示适当标记类型和数量因模型而异，但将填充标记直接放在最终'Answer:'标记前最有效。较小模型受益最大，SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct提升12.372个百分点。注意力图显示扩展空间通常延续原始注意力机制，有时聚焦于问题或答案选项。

Conclusion: 填充标记序列可作为额外计算容量而非冗余输入，为问题解决提供有意义的计算空间。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationale enables language models to use additional
task-related text for problem-solving, benefiting not only from detailed
reasoning steps but also from the expanded computational space of longer
inputs. Prior work has trained filler or special tokens to serve as additional
computation spaces. In this study, we investigate whether language models can
leverage artificially inserted sequences of filler tokens solely at inference.
We first identify effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations, then
examine at what stage of training models begin to exploit the expanded
computation space, and finally analyze dynamics within these spaces via
attention maps. Experiments on models ranging from 1.7B to 32B across
open-domain QA and math tasks show that appropriate token types and counts
vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final 'Answer:' token is
most effective. Smaller models benefit most, up to 12.372 percentage points in
SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, indicating that these spaces act as additional
computational capacity rather than redundant input. Attention maps reveal that
expanded spaces often continue the original attention mechanism and sometimes
focus on questions or answer options, suggesting meaningful computation for
problem-solving.

Motivation: 由于信息过载，长文档摘要能力日益重要，但西班牙语文档特别是法律领域缺乏此类摘要资源。

Method: 创建BOE-XSUM数据集，包含西班牙官方公报文档及其简明摘要，然后对中等规模LLM进行微调，并与零样本通用模型进行对比。

Result: 微调模型显著优于非专业化模型，最佳模型BERTIN GPT-J 6B比最佳零样本模型DeepSeek-R1性能提升24%（准确率41.6% vs. 33.5%）。

Conclusion: 针对特定领域微调的LLM在法律文档摘要任务中表现优于通用模型，证明了领域专业化的重要性。

Abstract: The ability to summarize long documents succinctly is increasingly important
in daily life due to information overload, yet there is a notable lack of such
summaries for Spanish documents in general, and in the legal domain in
particular. In this work, we present BOE-XSUM, a curated dataset comprising
3,648 concise, plain-language summaries of documents sourced from Spain's
``Bolet\'{\i}n Oficial del Estado'' (BOE), the State Official Gazette. Each
entry in the dataset includes a short summary, the original text, and its
document type label. We evaluate the performance of medium-sized large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuned on BOE-XSUM, comparing them to general-purpose
generative models in a zero-shot setting. Results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their non-specialized counterparts. Notably, the
best-performing model -- BERTIN GPT-J 6B (32-bit precision) -- achieves a 24\%
performance gain over the top zero-shot model, DeepSeek-R1 (accuracies of
41.6\% vs.\ 33.5\%).

Motivation: 大型语言模型能生成流畅文本，但其复制特定人类作者独特风格的能力尚不清楚。

Method: 集成TF-IDF字符n-gram与transformer嵌入，通过经验距离分布分类文本对，无需监督训练或阈值调优。

Result: 在学术论文上达到97.5%准确率，跨域评估94.5%，相比参数基线减少91.8%训练时间和59%内存使用。提示策略比模型大小对风格保真度影响更大。

Conclusion: 风格保真度和统计可检测性是可分离的，为未来作者建模、检测和身份条件生成建立了可复现基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, but their ability to
replicate the distinctive style of a specific human author remains unclear. We
present a fast, training-free framework for authorship verification and style
imitation analysis. The method integrates TF-IDF character n-grams with
transformer embeddings and classifies text pairs through empirical distance
distributions, eliminating the need for supervised training or threshold
tuning. It achieves 97.5\% accuracy on academic essays and 94.5\% in
cross-domain evaluation, while reducing training time by 91.8\% and memory
usage by 59\% relative to parameter-based baselines. Using this framework, we
evaluate five LLMs from three separate families (Llama, Qwen, Mixtral) across
four prompting strategies - zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and text completion.
Results show that the prompting strategy has a more substantial influence on
style fidelity than model size: few-shot prompting yields up to 23.5x higher
style-matching accuracy than zero-shot, and completion prompting reaches 99.9\%
agreement with the original author's style. Crucially, high-fidelity imitation
does not imply human-like unpredictability - human essays average a perplexity
of 29.5, whereas matched LLM outputs average only 15.2. These findings
demonstrate that stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are
separable, establishing a reproducible basis for future work in authorship
modeling, detection, and identity-conditioned generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前关于大语言模型推理能力的两个普遍假设：推理能力只在大模型中涌现，以及需要海量训练数据。重点关注第二个假设，即推理能力是否真的需要极大规模的数据集。

Method: 通过设计指标精心筛选和重采样开源数据集，仅使用约2T tokens的高质量数据进行预训练，然后采用4.2T tokens的重采样数据集进行预训练，并配合标准的后训练流程。

Result: 开发出MobileLLM-R1系列模型，其中950M参数的模型在AIME基准上获得15.5分，远超其他开源模型（OLMo-2-1.48B仅0.6分，SmolLM-2-1.7B仅0.3分）。尽管训练数据仅为Qwen3的11.7%，但在多个推理基准上达到或超越了Qwen3-0.6B。

Conclusion: 推理能力的涌现不一定需要海量数据，高质量的数据筛选和重采样策略可以显著降低数据需求，为开发高效的小型推理模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: The paradigm shift in large language models (LLMs) from instinctive responses
to chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has fueled two prevailing assumptions: (1)
reasoning capabilities only emerge in sufficiently large models, and (2) such
capabilities require training on massive datasets. While the first assumption
has already been challenged by recent sub-billion-parameter reasoning models
such as Qwen3-0.6B and DeepSeek distilled variants, the second remains largely
unquestioned. In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely
large corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and
resampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our
designed metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge
with far less data. Specifically, we show that only ~2T tokens of high-quality
data are sufficient, and pre-training with 4.2T tokens on the dataset resampled
from these ~2T tokens, followed by a established post-training procedure,
enables the development of MobileLLM-R1, a series of sub-billion-parameter
reasoning models that substantially outperform prior models trained on fully
open-sourced data. For example, MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves an AIME score of
15.5, compared to just 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B.
Remarkably, despite being trained on only 11.7% of the tokens compared to
Qwen3's proprietary 36T-token corpus for pretraining, MobileLLM-R1-950M matches
or surpasses Qwen3-0.6B across multiple reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate
further research in this direction, we have released the complete training
recipe, data sources, data mixing ratio, and model checkpoints, together with
the key insights obtained throughout this study.

### [173] [The Dialogue That Heals: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Doctor Agents' Inquiry Capability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24958)
*Linlu Gong,Ante Wang,Yunghwei Lai,Weizhi Ma,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAQuE是最大的医疗多轮问诊自动评估基准，包含3000个模拟患者代理，评估AI医生的问诊能力、对话能力、效率和患者体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI医生主要关注诊断技能，但忽视了同理心、沟通等优秀医生的其他重要品质，需要全面评估医疗问诊能力。

Method: 构建包含3000个模拟患者代理的基准，这些代理具有多样化语言模式、认知限制、情绪反应和被动披露倾向，并引入多维度评估框架。

Result: 实验显示不同LLM在评估维度上都面临显著挑战，最先进模型在问诊能力上仍有很大改进空间，对患者行为变化高度敏感。

Conclusion: 需要平衡性能与实用性，细粒度指标揭示了不同评估视角之间的权衡，为现实临床环境中的AI医生开发提供重要指导。

Abstract: An effective physician should possess a combination of empathy, expertise,
patience, and clear communication when treating a patient. Recent advances have
successfully endowed AI doctors with expert diagnostic skills, particularly the
ability to actively seek information through inquiry. However, other essential
qualities of a good doctor remain overlooked. To bridge this gap, we present
MAQuE(Medical Agent Questioning Evaluation), the largest-ever benchmark for the
automatic and comprehensive evaluation of medical multi-turn questioning. It
features 3,000 realistically simulated patient agents that exhibit diverse
linguistic patterns, cognitive limitations, emotional responses, and tendencies
for passive disclosure. We also introduce a multi-faceted evaluation framework,
covering task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry
efficiency, and patient experience. Experiments on different LLMs reveal
substantial challenges across the evaluation aspects. Even state-of-the-art
models show significant room for improvement in their inquiry capabilities.
These models are highly sensitive to variations in realistic patient behavior,
which considerably impacts diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, our fine-grained
metrics expose trade-offs between different evaluation perspectives,
highlighting the challenge of balancing performance and practicality in
real-world clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为SemanticShield的两阶段检测框架，通过整合项目侧语义信息来防御推荐系统中的shilling攻击，使用LLM进行语义一致性评估，并在六种攻击策略上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要关注用户侧行为，忽视了项目侧特征（如标题和描述）可能暴露的恶意意图，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 采用两阶段检测：第一阶段使用低成本行为标准预筛选可疑用户，第二阶段使用LLM进行语义一致性审计。通过强化学习微调轻量级LLM，设计专门的奖励函数来增强审计模型。

Result: 在六种代表性攻击策略上验证了SemanticShield的有效性，对未见过的攻击方法也表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SemanticShield通过整合项目侧语义信息，能够有效检测和防御推荐系统中的shilling攻击，并具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are widely used in e-commerce for personalized
suggestions, yet their openness makes them susceptible to shilling attacks,
where adversaries inject fake behaviors to manipulate recommendations. Most
existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side
features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To
address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates
item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage
pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second
stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore,
we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a
lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a
specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative
attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against
shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods
shows its strong generalization capability. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出广义正确性模型(GCM)，通过注入历史正确性信息来改进LLM置信度估计，发现可靠置信度估计是可泛化的技能而非依赖自我反思。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在高风险应用中需要准确校准的置信度估计，但现有方法依赖模型的"自我认知"能力，效果有限。

Method: 提出多种注入历史正确性信息的方法，训练GCM模型，并探索上下文示例和事后校准等替代方法。

Result: GCM在5个模型家族和多个数据集上表现良好，在选择性预测任务中有效，发现答案措辞是正确性的强预测因子。

Conclusion: 可靠置信度估计是通过系统编码正确性历史学习的可泛化技能，而非依赖模型特定自我反思能力。

Abstract: Generating accurate and calibrated confidence estimates is critical for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes or user-facing applications, and remains an open
challenge. Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting
a model's "self-knowledge", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its
own answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some
privileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the
model itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict
the correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an
unrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a
"Correctness Model" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical
predictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness
information, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that
GCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns
for correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use
CMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its
generalization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that
answer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore
alternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that
including history as in-context examples can help improve correctness
prediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in
calibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families
and the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective
prediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a
generalizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding
correctness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on
self-introspection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型蒸馏只关注行为模仿，将教师模型的内部计算视为黑盒。本文旨在蒸馏教师模型实现的基础计算机制。

Method: 提出电路蒸馏方法，匹配功能对应的电路组件，并引入反映这些组件诱导表示相似性的损失函数。

Result: 在Llama3系列模型上的实验表明，电路蒸馏优于标准蒸馏，仅调整学生模型的小部分参数就能成功转移算法能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了转移机制的可行性，可能通过可解释和可控的内部学生机制实现有针对性的教师能力高效蒸馏。

Abstract: Model distillation typically focuses on behavioral mimicry, where a student
model is trained to replicate a teacher's output while treating its internal
computations as a black box. In this work we propose an alternative approach:
Distilling the underlying computational mechanisms implemented by a teacher
model. Specifically, we propose circuit distillation, which introduces an
objective to align internal representations between analogous circuit
components in teacher and student models. We propose a method to match
``functionally correspondent'' circuit components and introduce a loss
reflecting similarities between the representations that these induce. We
evaluate circuit distillation on entity tracking and theory of mind (ToM) tasks
using models from the Llama3 family. Our results demonstrate that circuit
distillation outperforms standard distillation, successfully transferring
algorithmic capabilities by adjusting only a small, targeted subset of student
model parameters. This work establishes the feasibility of transferring
mechanisms, which may in turn allow for efficient distillation of targeted
teacher capabilities via interpretable and controllable internal student
mechanisms.

Conclusion: DiDi-Instruct是一种高效有效的蒸馏方法，能够实现眨眼间的语言生成，代码和模型将在GitHub发布。

Abstract: Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the
AI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct
(DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation
models by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language
model (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM
counterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical
part of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of
integral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We
also introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state
matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly
improve the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference
performances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated
language generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard
dLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128
NFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss
of about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further
validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive
ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein
sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective
distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We
will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态方面级情感分析模型难以过滤视觉噪声，无法有效对齐文本方面与跨模态的意见内容。

Method: 引入三个专门的mLSTM：Syn-mLSTM整合句法结构，Sem-mLSTM强调方面-语义相关性，Fuse-mLSTM执行选择性多模态融合。

Result: 在两个Twitter基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，GateMABSA优于多个基线模型。

Conclusion: GateMABSA通过门控多模态架构有效解决了MABSA中的噪声过滤和跨模态对齐挑战。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has recently advanced into the
multimodal domain, where user-generated content often combines text and images.
However, existing multimodal ABSA (MABSA) models struggle to filter noisy
visual signals, and effectively align aspects with opinion-bearing content
across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GateMABSA, a novel
gated multimodal architecture that integrates syntactic, semantic, and
fusion-aware mLSTM. Specifically, GateMABSA introduces three specialized
mLSTMs: Syn-mLSTM to incorporate syntactic structure, Sem-mLSTM to emphasize
aspect--semantic relevance, and Fuse-mLSTM to perform selective multimodal
fusion. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Twitter datasets demonstrate
that GateMABSA outperforms several baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的LLM向量空间解码方法——超维探针，结合符号表示和神经探测技术，通过向量符号架构将模型的残差流投影到可解释概念中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的可解释性方法（如直接对数归因和稀疏自编码器）对LLM内部表示的理解有限，存在模型输出词汇限制和特征名称不清晰等问题。

Method: 使用向量符号架构（VSAs）将LLM残差流投影到可解释概念空间，结合稀疏自编码器和传统探针的优点，克服其关键限制。

Result: 实验表明该探针能在不同LLM、嵌入大小和输入领域中可靠提取有意义概念，并帮助识别LLM失败情况。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了LLM向量空间中的信息解码，能够从神经表示中提取更具信息性、可解释性和结构化的特征。

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with
limited understanding of their internal representations. Current
interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse
autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the
model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces
Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM
vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural
probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via
Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs
and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our
decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's
final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern
recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess
it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both
before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably
extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input
domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information
decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative,
interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型作为语音识别后处理模块的能力，重点关注其在语音障碍语音错误纠正方面的应用，解决传统方法在不确定ASR区域过度纠正的问题。

Method: 提出置信度提示方法，将词级不确定性估计直接嵌入到LLM训练中，通过微调LLaMA 3.1模型，并与仅使用转录文本的微调和后处理置信度过滤方法进行比较。

Result: 在Speech Accessibility Project自发语音数据集上相对WER降低10%，在TORGO数据集上降低47%，证明了置信度感知微调对受损语音的有效性。

Conclusion: 置信度提示方法能够有效指导模型关注不确定的ASR区域，减少过度纠正，显著提高语音障碍语音识别的准确性。

Abstract: We investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) as post-processing
modules for automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on their ability to
perform error correction for disordered speech. In particular, we propose
confidence-informed prompting, where word-level uncertainty estimates are
embedded directly into LLM training to improve robustness and generalization
across speakers and datasets. This approach directs the model to uncertain ASR
regions and reduces overcorrection. We fine-tune a LLaMA 3.1 model and compare
our approach to both transcript-only fine-tuning and post hoc confidence-based
filtering. Evaluations show that our method achieves a 10% relative WER
reduction compared to naive LLM correction on the Speech Accessibility Project
spontaneous speech and a 47% reduction on TORGO, demonstrating the
effectiveness of confidence-aware fine-tuning for impaired speech.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Transformer在程序轨迹生成任务上的表现，发现虽然模型在分布内准确率高，但在泛化到不同因素时存在系统性失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer在程序轨迹生成任务上的表现，该任务通过长轨迹外部化推理过程，每个步骤都很简单。

Method: 训练小型Transformer，采用多样化的修改，包括替代位置编码、softmax替代、混合模型和短卷积等。

Result: 模型在分布内达到强准确率，但在泛化到程序长度、轨迹步骤等不同因素时出现系统性失败，某些设计显著改善了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 虽然Transformer在程序轨迹生成任务上表现良好，但在泛化方面仍存在挑战，某些架构修改能够改善泛化性能。

Abstract: We study Transformers on the task \emph{program trace generation} (PTG),
where models produce step-by-step execution traces for synthetic programs.
Unlike existing algorithmic problems, PTG externalizes reasoning through long
traces where each step is trivial. We train small Transformers with diverse
modifications, including alternative position encodings, softmax replacements,
hybrid model, and short convolutions. While these models achieve strong
in-distribution accuracy, they exhibit systematic failures when generalizing to
various factors (e.g., program length, trace steps), though some designs
significantly improve generalization.

Motivation: 当前的数据分析智能体严重依赖基于专有模型的提示工程，而开源模型在处理多样化格式、大规模数据文件以及现实分析所需的长周期多步推理方面存在困难。

Method: DataMind采用：1）细粒度任务分类和递归易到难任务组合机制；2）知识增强的轨迹采样策略；3）动态可调的SFT和RL损失组合训练目标；4）内存节省且稳定的基于代码的多轮推理框架。

Result: 基于DataMind构建的DataMind-14B在多个数据分析基准测试中平均得分71.16%，超过了最强的专有基线DeepSeek-V3.1和GPT-5；DataMind-7B在所有开源模型中表现最佳，得分68.10%。

Conclusion: DataMind成功构建了高性能的开源数据分析智能体，提供了可扩展的训练方法和高质量的数据集，为社区提供了实用的智能体训练见解。

Abstract: Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific
discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however,
rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source
models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and
long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This
paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe
designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key
challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient
data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn
rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a
recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and
difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling
strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically
adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a
memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on
DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning
diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic
tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with
an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming
the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B
also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also
incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the
analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic
training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B
for the community's future research.

Motivation: 传统晚交互模型如ColBERT采用分离编码和多向量匹配，缺乏文档间的丰富交互。本文旨在开发更紧凑高效的交互方法。

Method: 提出"最后但不晚交互"方法，在相同上下文窗口中对查询和文档进行因果自注意力计算，在提取每个文档最后一个token的上下文嵌入前实现跨文档交互。

Result: 在BEIR基准测试中达到61.94 nDCG@10的最先进性能，模型大小仅为0.6B参数，比生成式列表重排序器小十倍。

Abstract: jina-reranker-v3 is a 0.6B parameter multilingual document reranker that
introduces a novel last but not late interaction. Unlike late interaction
models such as ColBERT that perform separate encoding followed by multi-vector
matching, our approach conducts causal self-attention between query and
documents within the same context window, enabling rich cross-document
interactions before extracting contextual embeddings from the last token of
each document. This compact architecture achieves state-of-the-art BEIR
performance with 61.94 nDCG@10 while being ten times smaller than generative
listwise rerankers.

Method: 利用可在本地部署的小型LLM，探索知识蒸馏与合成数据以及上下文学习作为基线方法，并提出基于模型输出概率的有害简化检测过滤策略。

Result: 实验在五种语言中进行，手动分析显示知识蒸馏虽然提高自动指标得分，但会增加有害简化。模型输出概率是检测有害简化的有效信号，过滤策略能有效抑制有害简化同时保留有益简化。

Conclusion: 为使用小型LLM的高效安全词汇简化建立了基准，揭示了性能、效率和安全性之间的关键权衡，展示了安全实际部署的有前景方法。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance, large language models (LLMs) face
challenges in real-world application of lexical simplification (LS),
particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments.
Moreover, since vulnerable user groups (e.g., people with disabilities) are one
of the key target groups of this technology, it is crucial to ensure the safety
and correctness of the output of LS systems. To address these issues, we
propose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs
deployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge
distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our
experiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and
manually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts
automatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing
harmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output
probability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications.
Leveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful
simplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes
a benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key
trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a
promising approach for safe real-world deployment.

pairs 50 diverse research tasks across 10 domains with 25 authentic user

contexts, yielding 250 realistic user-task queries. To assess system
performance, we propose the PQR Evaluation Framework, which jointly measures
(P) Personalization Alignment, (Q) Content Quality, and (R) Factual
Reliability. Our experiments on a range of systems highlight current
capabilities and limitations in handling personalized deep research. This work

Our results show that web-scale knowledge extraction remains a challenging task
for LLMs. Despite achieving high QA accuracy, LLMs can still benefit from
knowledge extraction, through augmentation with extracted triples and
multi-task learning. These findings provide insights into the evolving role of
knowledge triple extraction in web-based QA and highlight strategies for
maximizing LLM effectiveness across different model sizes and resource
settings.

TL;DR: 该论文研究多语言大语言模型在事实核查中的语言偏见和检索偏见问题，评估了6个开源多语言LLM在20种语言上的表现，揭示了模型性能的不均衡性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在跨语言事实核查中表现出强大的能力，但这些模型存在语言偏见，在高资源语言（如英语）上的表现明显优于低资源语言。同时，检索系统也存在偏见，倾向于某些信息而忽略其他信息。

Method: 使用AMC-16K数据集，通过完全多语言提示策略评估6个开源多语言LLM在20种语言上的表现。将任务提示翻译成每种语言，分析单语和跨语言性能差异。同时使用多语言嵌入模型研究检索偏见，分析检索声明的频率分布。

Result: 研究发现LLM行为存在持续偏见，不同模型家族、规模和提示策略表现出关键趋势。检索偏见分析显示某些声明在不同帖子中被不成比例地检索，导致流行声明的检索性能被夸大，而较少见声明被低估。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了LLM行为中的持续偏见，为改善多语言事实核查的公平性提供了建议。需要采取措施减少语言和检索偏见，确保不同语言和声明的公平对待。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities for
cross-lingual fact-checking. However, these models often exhibit language bias,
performing disproportionately better on high-resource languages such as English
than on low-resource counterparts. We also present and inspect a novel concept
- retrieval bias, when information retrieval systems tend to favor certain
information over others, leaving the retrieval process skewed. In this paper,
we study language and retrieval bias in the context of Previously Fact-Checked
Claim Detection (PFCD). We evaluate six open-source multilingual LLMs across 20
languages using a fully multilingual prompting strategy, leveraging the AMC-16K
dataset. By translating task prompts into each language, we uncover disparities
in monolingual and cross-lingual performance and identify key trends based on
model family, size, and prompting strategy. Our findings highlight persistent
bias in LLM behavior and offer recommendations for improving equity in
multilingual fact-checking. To investigate retrieval bias, we employed
multilingual embedding models and look into the frequency of retrieved claims.
Our analysis reveals that certain claims are retrieved disproportionately
across different posts, leading to inflated retrieval performance for popular
claims while under-representing less common ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PbT是一种两阶段师生框架，无需人工标注或平行数据即可合成准确的输入-输出对，通过在低资源NLG场景中让教师LLM将未配对样本压缩为中间表示，训练学生从IR重构输入，从而生成高质量合成数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源自然语言生成场景中只有原始输出（如摘要、问题）或只有原始输入（如文章、对话）但很少同时拥有的问题，避免小模型只能从极少样本学习或依赖大LLM生成成本高、范围广的合成样本。

Method: 两阶段师生管道：1）教师LLM将未配对样本压缩为简洁中间表示；2）训练学生从IR重构输入，使输出能与学生生成的输入配对，产生高质量合成数据。

Result: 在5个基准测试（文档摘要、对话摘要、问题生成）和SwitchBoard未配对设置上，仅使用PbT数据训练的8B学生模型优于使用70B教师生成语料训练的模型和其他无监督基线，ROUGE-L仅比人工标注对低1.2，以三分之一标注成本填补82%的oracle差距。

Conclusion: PbT能生成简洁、忠实且符合目标风格的摘要，其优势在于生成避免不匹配的领域内源数据，限制直接合成的局限性。

Abstract: We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline
that synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel
data. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios,
practitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions,
or only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom
both. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely
on costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses
this by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise
intermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs
from IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs,
yielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five
benchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization
(SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired
setting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained
only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora
and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated
pairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of
direct synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only
PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style,
highlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the
mismatch, limiting direct synthesis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用NVFP4格式稳定训练大型语言模型的新方法，通过结合随机Hadamard变换、二维量化方案、随机舍入和选择性高精度层，在12B参数模型上验证了FP4训练的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM规模不断扩大，训练成本急剧增加。虽然FP8训练已被广泛采用，但转向更窄精度如FP4可以进一步提升计算速度和资源利用率，但4位量化在训练稳定性、收敛性和实现方面面临挑战。

Method: 集成随机Hadamard变换来限制块级异常值，采用二维量化方案确保前向和后向传递的一致性表示，使用随机舍入进行无偏梯度估计，并包含选择性高精度层。

Result: 在12B参数模型上训练10万亿token（迄今为止公开记录的最长4位精度训练运行），结果显示使用NVFP4的训练损失和下游任务准确率与FP8基线相当。

Conclusion: NVFP4结合本文的训练方法代表了窄精度LLM训练算法的重大进步，证明了4位精度训练的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) today are powerful problem solvers across many
domains, and they continue to get stronger as they scale in model size,
training set size, and training set quality, as shown by extensive research and
experimentation across the industry. Training a frontier model today requires
on the order of tens to hundreds of yottaflops, which is a massive investment
of time, compute, and energy. Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore
essential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit
floating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even
narrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional
improvements in computational speed and resource utilization. However,
quantization at this level poses challenges to training stability, convergence,
and implementation, notably for large-scale models trained on long token
horizons.
  In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stable and accurate training
of large language models (LLMs) using the NVFP4 format. Our method integrates
Random Hadamard transforms (RHT) to bound block-level outliers, employs a
two-dimensional quantization scheme for consistent representations across both
the forward and backward passes, utilizes stochastic rounding for unbiased
gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers. We
validate our approach by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion
tokens -- the longest publicly documented training run in 4-bit precision to
date. Our results show that the model trained with our NVFP4-based pretraining
technique achieves training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to
an FP8 baseline. These findings highlight that NVFP4, when combined with our
training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM
training algorithms.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) steering has emerged as a promising paradigm for
controlling model behavior at inference time through targeted manipulation of
hidden states, offering a lightweight alternative to expensive retraining.
However, existing steering frameworks suffer from critical limitations:
computational inefficiency, limited extensibility, and restricted functionality
that hinder both research progress and practical deployment. We present
EasySteer, a unified framework for high-performance, extensible LLM steering
built on vLLM. Our system features modular architecture with pluggable
interfaces for both analysis-based and learning-based methods, fine-grained
parameter control, pre-computed steering vectors for eight application domains,
and an interactive demonstration system. Through deep integration with vLLM's
optimized inference engine, EasySteer achieves 5.5-11.4$\times$ speedup over
existing frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in
overthinking mitigation, hallucination reduction, and other key applications.
EasySteer transforms steering from research technique to production-ready
capability, establishing critical infrastructure for deployable, controllable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法推理成本高，而直接评分回归方法存在尺度不一致问题，需要开发更高效准确的论文质量评估方法。

Method: 采用领域-年份组内的成对学习减少评审评分不一致，引入评审倾向信号(RTS)作为评审分数和置信度的概率整合，构建NAIDv2数据集进行训练评估。

Result: 在ICLR数据集上达到78.2% AUC和0.432 Spearman相关系数的最优性能，在NeurIPS数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力，推理时保持线性时间效率。

Conclusion: NAIPv2为自动化论文质量评估提供了一个去偏且可扩展的框架，是迈向未来科学智能系统的重要一步。

Abstract: The ability to estimate the quality of scientific papers is central to how
both humans and AI systems will advance scientific knowledge in the future.
However, existing LLM-based estimation methods suffer from high inference cost,
whereas the faster direct score regression approach is limited by scale
inconsistencies. We present NAIPv2, a debiased and efficient framework for
paper quality estimation. NAIPv2 employs pairwise learning within domain-year
groups to reduce inconsistencies in reviewer ratings and introduces the Review
Tendency Signal (RTS) as a probabilistic integration of reviewer scores and
confidences. To support training and evaluation, we further construct NAIDv2, a
large-scale dataset of 24,276 ICLR submissions enriched with metadata and
detailed structured content. Trained on pairwise comparisons but enabling
efficient pointwise prediction at deployment, NAIPv2 achieves state-of-the-art
performance (78.2% AUC, 0.432 Spearman), while maintaining scalable,
linear-time efficiency at inference. Notably, on unseen NeurIPS submissions, it
further demonstrates strong generalization, with predicted scores increasing
consistently across decision categories from Rejected to Oral. These findings
establish NAIPv2 as a debiased and scalable framework for automated paper
quality estimation, marking a step toward future scientific intelligence
systems. Code and dataset are released at

TL;DR: 提出了Truthful Text Summarization (TTS)框架，通过激励机制提高文本摘要的事实准确性，无需真实标签即可增强事实鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM搜索和问答系统在合成多个可能冲突的文本时，缺乏对信息源准确性的有效激励，容易受到对抗性内容的影响。

Method: TTS框架包括四个步骤：(i)将草稿摘要分解为原子声明；(ii)获取每个信息源对每个声明的立场；(iii)使用改进的多任务同伴预测机制对信息源评分；(iv)在重新摘要前过滤不可靠信息源。

Result: 实验表明TTS提高了事实准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持了流畅性，使信息曝光与信息性佐证对齐，并抑制了操纵行为。

Conclusion: TTS通过形式化保证使信息源的激励与信息性诚实对齐，使真实报告成为效用最大化的策略，为LLM文本合成提供了有效的激励机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in modern search and
answer systems to synthesize multiple, sometimes conflicting, texts into a
single response, yet current pipelines offer weak incentives for sources to be
accurate and are vulnerable to adversarial content. We introduce Truthful Text
Summarization (TTS), an incentive-aligned framework that improves factual
robustness without ground-truth labels. TTS (i) decomposes a draft synthesis
into atomic claims, (ii) elicits each source's stance on every claim, (iii)
scores sources with an adapted multi-task peer-prediction mechanism that
rewards informative agreement, and (iv) filters unreliable sources before
re-summarizing. We establish formal guarantees that align a source's incentives
with informative honesty, making truthful reporting the utility-maximizing
strategy. Experiments show that TTS improves factual accuracy and robustness
while preserving fluency, aligning exposure with informative corroboration and
disincentivizing manipulation.

TL;DR: 提出了Learn2PD框架，通过训练轻量级自适应过滤器模型来预测每个token位置是否与最终输出匹配，实现动态并行解码，显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码在大语言模型中需要O(n)顺序步骤，限制了推理吞吐量。现有并行解码策略使用固定的输入无关启发式方法，无法适应输入特定特征，导致跨不同NLP任务的速度-质量权衡不佳。

Method: Learn2PD框架训练轻量级自适应过滤器模型预测每个token位置是否匹配最终输出，近似oracle并行解码策略。引入文本结束预测(EoTP)检测解码完成，避免填充token的冗余解码。

Result: 在LLaDA基准测试中，方法实现了最高22.58倍加速且无性能下降，结合KV-Cache时可达57.51倍加速。

Conclusion: Learn2PD提供了一种灵活动态的并行解码方法，通过后训练学习自适应过滤器，在保持质量的同时显著提升推理速度。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ sequential steps for $n$ tokens, fundamentally limiting
inference throughput. Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token
generation through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding
strategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence
thresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting
in suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work,
we explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We
propose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a
lightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position,
whether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter
approximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when
correctly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a
post-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize
it (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction
(EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant
decoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves up to 22.58$\times$ speedup without any performance drop,
and up to 57.51$\times$ when combined with KV-Cache.

Abstract: Building Large Language Model agents that expand their capabilities by
interacting with external tools represents a new frontier in AI research and
applications. In this paper, we introduce InfoAgent, a deep research agent
powered by an innovative data synthesis pipeline and orchestrated web search
tools. To construct challenging, hard-to-find queries,we build entity trees and
apply sub-tree sampling with entity fuzzification to systematically increase
question difficulty. Unlike prior work that relies heavily on commercial search
tools, we develop a dedicated self-hosted search infrastructure, enhancing
transparency of agent environments and facilitating further advancement of
agent capacity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our data pipeline by measuring
the average number of tool calls required to correctly answer a question, and
also show that our agent yields better performance when equipped with our
tools. Our \mbox{InfoAgent} is post-trained from Qwen3-14B using a two-stage

TL;DR: 提出Masked History Learning (MHL)训练框架，通过历史重建任务增强生成式推荐模型对用户意图的理解，超越纯自回归训练的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐系统仅依赖自回归训练，专注于预测下一个物品，但忽略了用户交互历史的丰富内部结构，无法真正理解用户意图。

Method: MHL框架在标准自回归目标基础上增加历史物品重建的辅助任务，包含熵引导的掩码策略和课程学习调度器，从历史重建逐步过渡到未来预测。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于最先进的生成模型，证明了深入理解过去对准确预测用户未来路径的重要性。

Conclusion: 对用户历史行为的全面理解对于准确预测未来路径至关重要，MHL框架通过历史重建任务有效提升了生成式推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Generative recommendation, which directly generates item identifiers, has
emerged as a promising paradigm for recommendation systems. However, its
potential is fundamentally constrained by the reliance on purely autoregressive
training. This approach focuses solely on predicting the next item while
ignoring the rich internal structure of a user's interaction history, thus
failing to grasp the underlying intent. To address this limitation, we propose
Masked History Learning (MHL), a novel training framework that shifts the
objective from simple next-step prediction to deep comprehension of history.
MHL augments the standard autoregressive objective with an auxiliary task of
reconstructing masked historical items, compelling the model to understand
``why'' an item path is formed from the user's past behaviors, rather than just
``what'' item comes next. We introduce two key contributions to enhance this
framework: (1) an entropy-guided masking policy that intelligently targets the
most informative historical items for reconstruction, and (2) a curriculum
learning scheduler that progressively transitions from history reconstruction
to future prediction. Experiments on three public datasets show that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, highlighting that
a comprehensive understanding of the past is crucial for accurately predicting
a user's future path. The code will be released to the public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理和RAG的普及，需要检索与任务间接或隐式相关的文档，这对现有IR技术提出了挑战。

Method: 引入基于标准的关联评分机制，通过明确标准推理任务与文档关系；支持测试时扩展，通过分数集成结合多个推理轨迹；使用新颖的强化学习算法优化推理能力。

Result: 在BRIGHT基准测试中表现优于现有文档检索方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Retro*通过细粒度推理和可扩展的评分机制，有效解决了推理密集型文档检索的挑战。

Abstract: With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly
important to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even
when their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this
problem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance
between the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a
significant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in
reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
applicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a
novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method
introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to
reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly
defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance
score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning
trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance
estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism,
which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each
training sample. Our experiments show that Retro* outperforms existing document
retrieval methods with notable advantages, leading to state-of-the-art
performance on the BRIGHT benchmark.

Motivation: 合成数据虽能提升LLM性能，但其引入的安全风险尚未被充分研究。本文旨在系统评估合成数据训练范式对主流投毒和后门攻击的抵抗力。

Method: 提出病毒感染攻击(VIA)框架，将投毒载荷隐藏在保护壳中，在良性样本中寻找最优劫持点以最大化生成恶意内容的可能性。

Result: 实验表明VIA显著增加了合成数据中的投毒内容，使下游模型的攻击成功率提升到与上游投毒模型相当的水平。

Conclusion: 合成数据训练范式对现有攻击具有抵抗力，但VIA攻击能有效规避这种抵抗力，揭示了合成数据引入的安全风险。

Abstract: Synthetic data refers to artificial samples generated by models. While it has
been validated to significantly enhance the performance of large language
models (LLMs) during training and has been widely adopted in LLM development,
potential security risks it may introduce remain uninvestigated. This paper
systematically evaluates the resilience of synthetic-data-integrated training
paradigm for LLMs against mainstream poisoning and backdoor attacks. We reveal
that such a paradigm exhibits strong resistance to existing attacks, primarily
thanks to the different distribution patterns between poisoning data and
queries used to generate synthetic samples. To enhance the effectiveness of
these attacks and further investigate the security risks introduced by
synthetic data, we introduce a novel and universal attack framework, namely,
Virus Infection Attack (VIA), which enables the propagation of current attacks
through synthetic data even under purely clean queries. Inspired by the
principles of virus design in cybersecurity, VIA conceals the poisoning payload
within a protective "shell" and strategically searches for optimal hijacking
points in benign samples to maximize the likelihood of generating malicious
content. Extensive experiments on both data poisoning and backdoor attacks show
that VIA significantly increases the presence of poisoning content in synthetic
data and correspondingly raises the attack success rate (ASR) on downstream
models to levels comparable to those observed in the poisoned upstream models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在敏感系统中存在隐私风险，而本地部署的SLM在复杂任务上表现不佳，需要一种既能保护隐私又能保持高性能的解决方案。

Method: 使用抽象化作为隐私保护机制，保留必要信息同时丢弃不必要细节，通过控制隐私-效用权衡来实现更好的平衡。

Result: MaskSQL在文本转SQL任务中超越了领先的SLM模型，性能接近最先进的LLM模型，同时有效保护了隐私。

Conclusion: MaskSQL框架成功解决了隐私保护与模型性能之间的权衡问题，为敏感环境下的文本转SQL应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on tasks that
require reasoning, such as text-to-SQL, code generation, and debugging.
However, regulatory frameworks with strict privacy requirements constrain their
integration into sensitive systems. State-of-the-art LLMs are also proprietary,
costly, and resource-intensive, making local deployment impractical.
Consequently, utilizing such LLMs often requires sharing data with third-party
providers, raising privacy concerns and risking noncompliance with regulations.
Although fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) can outperform LLMs on certain
tasks and be deployed locally to mitigate privacy concerns, they underperform
on more complex tasks such as text-to-SQL translation. In this work, we
introduce MaskSQL, a text-to-SQL framework that utilizes abstraction as a
privacy protection mechanism to mask sensitive information in LLM prompts.
Unlike redaction, which removes content entirely, or generalization, which
broadens tokens, abstraction retains essential information while discarding
unnecessary details, striking an effective privacy-utility balance for the
text-to-SQL task. Moreover, by providing mechanisms to control the
privacy-utility tradeoff, MaskSQL facilitates adoption across a broader range
of use cases. Our experimental results show that MaskSQL outperforms leading
SLM-based text-to-SQL models and achieves performance approaching
state-of-the-art LLM-based models, while preserving privacy.

TL;DR: VideoScore2是一个多维度、可解释的视频评估框架，通过三个维度（视觉质量、文本-视频对齐、物理/常识一致性）和思维链推理来评估文本到视频生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频评估方法局限于单一不透明分数，缺乏可解释性，无法全面捕捉视频质量评估的多方面特性。

Method: 使用包含27,168个人工标注视频的大规模数据集VideoFeedback2，采用两阶段训练流程：监督微调后使用GRPO进行强化学习以增强分析鲁棒性。

Result: 在VideoScore-Bench-v2基准测试中达到44.35（+5.94）准确率，在四个外部基准测试中平均性能达到50.37（+4.32）。

Conclusion: VideoScore2提供了可解释的评估，通过有效的奖励建模为可控生成架起桥梁，支持Best-of-N采样。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),
while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between
evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for
Best-of-N sampling. Project Page: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/VideoScore2/

*Zetian Wu,Tianshuo Zhou,Stefan Lee,Liang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的手语翻译方法，通过显式建模骨骼关节关系、引入几何约束和父节点相对重加权机制，显著提升了手语视频生成的自然度和解剖学准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语翻译方法往往忽视人体骨骼运动的解剖学约束和协调模式，导致生成的动作僵硬或不符合生物力学原理，影响聋人和听力障碍者的有效沟通。

Method: 显式建模骨骼关节关系，包括肩部、手臂和手部；引入关节位置、骨骼长度和运动动态的几何约束；采用父节点相对重加权机制增强手指灵活性；使用骨骼姿态损失和骨骼长度约束确保解剖学一致性。

Result: 将先前最佳方法与真实标注之间的性能差距缩小了56.51%，骨骼长度和运动方差不一致性分别减少了18.76%和5.48%，在解剖学真实性和运动自然度方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式建模骨骼约束和协调关系，有效解决了手语翻译中的动作自然度和解剖学准确性问题，为聋人和听力障碍者提供了更有效的沟通工具。

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

*Haorui Yu,Qiufeng Yi,Yijia Chu,Yang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs表面具有文化能力但实际依赖表面模式匹配而非真正文化理解。通过诊断框架分析火主题文化图像，发现模型存在系统性偏见：能识别西方节日但难以理解弱势文化事件，甚至将紧急情况误分类为庆祝活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示VLMs在文化理解上的局限性，这些模型看似文化胜任但实际依赖符号捷径而非深层理解，存在将紧急情况误判为庆祝活动的危险。

Method: 引入诊断框架，通过分类和解释分析来探测VLM对火主题文化图像的推理能力，测试了西方节日、非西方传统和紧急场景。

Result: 模型系统性偏见明显：能正确识别突出的西方节日，但在弱势文化事件上表现不佳，经常提供模糊标签或危险地将紧急情况误分类为庆祝活动。

Conclusion: 这些失败暴露了符号捷径的风险，强调需要超越准确度指标的文化评估，以确保可解释和公平的多模态系统。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We
introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural
imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple
models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes
reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western
festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently
offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as
celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and
highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure
interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

*Sahithya Ravi,Aditya Chinchure,Raymond T. Ng,Leonid Sigal,Vered Shwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPIKE是一个推理时框架，通过量化贝叶斯惊喜来识别视频中的关键时刻，并基于惊喜权重进行帧采样，在多个下游基准测试中优于均匀采样方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视频通常包含常规活动和令人难忘的惊喜事件，但现有Video-LLMs通过均匀采样帧可能错过定义视频叙事的关键时刻。

Method: 引入SPIKE框架量化贝叶斯惊喜，识别新视觉证据与先前信念冲突的时刻；开发SPIKE-RL使用GRPO优化信念假设；基于惊喜权重进行帧采样。

Result: SPIKE能有效定位视频中的惊喜时刻，与人类在正负惊喜基准测试上强相关；惊喜权重帧采样在五个下游基准测试中持续优于均匀采样。

Conclusion: 通过让Video-LLMs跟踪信念并注册惊喜，为构建更鲁棒的模型铺平道路，这些模型能够根据新信息修正理解。

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

*Tanawan Premsri,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FoR-SALE框架，通过引入参考框架概念来改进基于LLM的扩散模型在空间描述生成图像时的性能，特别针对非相机视角的空间描述进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像生成模型在处理非相机视角的空间描述时存在显著性能差距，需要将长期被忽视的参考框架概念整合到多模态语言模型中。

Method: 扩展SLD框架，通过视觉模块提取图像空间配置，将空间表达式映射到相机视角，检测语言与视觉的对齐情况，应用新颖的潜在空间操作调整生成图像的朝向和深度。

Result: 在专门评估参考框架空间理解的两个基准测试中，FoR-SALE将最先进T2I模型的性能提升了高达5.3%，仅需单轮校正。

Conclusion: FoR-SALE框架成功地将参考框架概念整合到文本到图像生成中，显著提升了模型对空间描述的理解和生成能力。

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

### [204] [Multi-modal Data Spectrum: Multi-modal Datasets are Multi-dimensional](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23499)
*Divyam Madaan,Varshan Muhunthan,Kyunghyun Cho,Sumit Chopra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过大规模实证分析发现，多模态基准测试中存在显著的模态依赖不平衡问题，许多旨在减轻文本偏见的基准反而放大了图像依赖，且模型越大越倾向于利用单模态依赖而非真正的多模态推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解单模态依赖（单个模态对目标任务的贡献）和跨模态依赖（模态间关系及其与目标任务的关联）之间的相互作用对于推进多模态学习至关重要，但目前基准评估中这些依赖的性质和相互作用仍缺乏系统表征。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对23个视觉问答基准进行大规模实证研究，涵盖通用知识推理、专家知识推理、光学字符识别和文档理解等领域。

Result: 研究发现视觉、文本及其相互作用的依赖程度在不同基准间和基准内部存在显著差异；许多旨在减轻文本偏见的基准无意中放大了图像依赖；这种特征在不同模型规模中持续存在，大模型常利用单模态依赖实现高性能，掩盖了多模态推理能力的不足。

Conclusion: 研究提供了多模态数据集的量化表征，为多模态基准设计和评估提供了原则性方法，揭示了当前基准测试中存在的模态依赖不平衡问题。

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

*YuQian Li,Limeng Qiao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RIV模型，通过自省训练和递归推理机制为掩码扩散视觉语言模型添加自校正能力，在多个基准测试中实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有掩码扩散视觉语言模型无法纠正生成token中的错误，缺乏自校正能力

Method: 1. 自省训练：引入自省模型识别生成序列中的错误（语法、拼写和逻辑错误）
2. 递归推理：交替进行解掩码→自省→重掩码的递归过程，直到获得可靠结果

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现出色，优于大多数现有MDVLMs

Conclusion: RIV模型成功为掩码扩散视觉语言模型添加了自校正能力，实现了最先进的性能

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了区域理解指数（RCI），这是首个基于模型的评分方法，用于直接量化数据集对全局与局部视觉信息的依赖程度，揭示多模态基准测试中存在的空间偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在视觉语言基准测试中表现优异，但不清楚这些基准是否真正评估全局推理能力，还是允许通过局部视觉线索获得成功。现有评估方法无法明确区分这一点，阻碍了有效数据集构建和面向现实世界的模型开发。

Method: 引入RCI评分方法，通过系统比较参考模型在图像块与完整图像上的性能表现，揭示任务是否需要整体图像理解，还是可以通过部分或局部视觉线索解决。

Result: 将RCI应用于13个广泛使用的多模态基准测试，发现大多数基准倾向于局部推理，并表现出显著的空间偏见，表明在现实世界应用中存在潜在风险。

Conclusion: RCI为研究人员和从业者提供了可操作的工具，用于诊断和缓解这些偏见，从而能够构建促进稳健、企业级多模态系统发展的数据集和基准测试。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on
vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks
assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to
directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual
information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image
patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image
understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &
practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases,
enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development
of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

*Siyuan Gao,Jiashu Yao,Haoyu Wen,Yuhang Guo,Zeming Liu,Heyan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HomeSafeBench基准测试，包含12,900个数据点，涵盖5种常见家庭安全隐患，通过动态第一人称视角图像评估视觉语言模型在家庭安全检查中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在两个关键局限：1）使用文本描述而非视觉信息，阻碍了基于视觉语言模型的具身智能体的准确评估；2）使用单一静态视角，限制了智能体的自由探索，导致某些被遮挡的安全隐患被遗漏。

Method: 构建包含12,900个数据点的基准测试，覆盖火灾、触电、物体坠落、绊倒和儿童安全等5类安全隐患。提供模拟家庭环境中的动态第一人称视角图像，允许具身智能体自由探索房间，获得多个动态视角。

Result: 对主流视觉语言模型的综合评估显示，即使表现最好的模型F1分数也仅为10.23%，表明当前模型存在显著局限性。模型在识别安全隐患和选择有效探索策略方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench为未来家庭安全检查相关研究提供了有价值的参考和支持，数据集和代码将公开发布。

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.
Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PCRI指标，首个系统化、可解释的评估MLLM对视觉上下文粒度变化鲁棒性的方法，通过比较局部图像块和完整图像输入的性能变化来量化模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在实际应用中的可靠性常因对无关或干扰性视觉上下文的敏感性而受损，现有评估指标无法捕捉这一方面。

Method: 引入PCRI指标，系统化评估MLLM在不同视觉上下文粒度下的性能变化，应用于19个先进MLLM在15个视觉语言基准上的测试。

Result: 大多数领先模型对背景噪声仍很脆弱，只有少数模型如InternVL2-26B和Qwen2VL-72B在各项任务中表现出一致的鲁棒性。PCRI分析揭示了不同模型架构如何处理和整合视觉上下文。

Conclusion: PCRI能够进行上下文鲁棒性的严格比较，支持基于原则的模型选择，并指导未来架构和训练策略的开发，以实现稳健的实际部署。

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and
training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

*Zhecheng Li,Guoxian Song,Yiwei Wang,Zhen Xiong,Junsong Yuan,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMS框架通过结合通用视觉语言模型和专用GUI定位模型，采用粗到细的策略显著提升GUI自然语言查询的定位性能，在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上实现35.7%的准确率，比单独模型提升10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GUI中自然语言查询定位的挑战，需要理解多样化的UI元素并准确预测空间坐标，现有单一模型难以同时满足通用性和精确性需求。

Method: 提出GMS框架，将通用VLM作为'Scanner'识别感兴趣区域，专用定位模型作为'Locator'输出精确坐标，采用五阶段分层搜索和跨模态通信实现粗到细的定位。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上，单独Scanner和Locator模型准确率仅为2.0%和3.7%，但GMS框架整合后达到35.7%的准确率，显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GMS框架通过协同利用通用和专用模型的互补优势，有效提升了GUI定位性能，展示了在通用GUI定位任务中的鲁棒性和潜力。

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

TL;DR: 提出了Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR)新范式，直接在视觉嵌入空间进行自回归推理，显著提升感知密集型视觉问答任务的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉信息视为静态前提条件，推理仍局限于语言空间，限制了多模态大语言模型的感知能力

Method: 使用视觉编码器将图像投影到与语言模型共享的联合语义空间中的视觉标记，训练语言模型生成重构关键视觉标记的潜在状态，并采用GRPO算法进行强化学习

Result: 在MMVP上达到71.67%的准确率，相比Qwen2.5-VL的66.67%有显著提升

Conclusion: LVR通过直接在视觉嵌入空间进行推理，显著改善了细粒度视觉理解和感知能力

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从孤立事实问答转向叙事连贯性和基于证据的合成监督信号的VideoQA训练框架，显著提升了模型性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VideoQA模型的监督信号局限于孤立的事实问答对，无法捕捉视频的叙事结构和因果关系，限制了模型的深度理解能力。

Method: 提出两种互补策略：QBP将多样化问题合成连贯叙事段落重建事件结构；QBC生成细粒度视觉依据为每个答案提供具体证据。利用生成模型合成数据，在统一的下一个token预测目标下训练VideoQA模型。

Result: 在STAR和NExT-QA数据集上取得显著精度提升，3B模型在STAR达到72.5%（+4.9%），7B模型在NExT-QA达到80.8%，建立新的SOTA。QBP和QBC都大幅提升跨数据集泛化能力，QBP还加速模型收敛超过2.5倍。

Conclusion: 从孤立事实转向叙事连贯性和基于证据的合成监督信号，能够产生更准确、高效和可泛化的VideoQA训练范式。

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

*Shijie Lian,Changti Wu,Laurence Tianruo Yang,Hang Yuan,Bin Yu,Lei Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用欧几里得几何问题作为代理任务来提升多模态大语言模型的空间推理能力，构建了包含3万个平面和立体几何问题的Euclid30K数据集，通过GRPO方法微调模型，在多个空间推理基准测试中实现了显著的零样本性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间智能是多模态大语言模型尚未解决的关键挑战，包括可视化形状变换、心理旋转、关系位置判断和数量估计等能力。为了填补这一空白，研究者选择欧几里得几何问题作为代理任务来训练模型的空间推理能力。

Method: 构建了精心策划的多模态数据集Euclid30K，包含约3万个平面和立体几何问题。使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法对Qwen2.5VL和RoboBrain2.0系列模型进行微调，使模型能够识别形状、计数、关联实体，并运用欧几里得原理进行多步演绎推理。

Result: 实验表明，经过Euclid30K训练的模型在四个空间推理基准测试（Super-CLEVR、Omni3DBench、VSI-Bench和MindCube）上实现了显著的零样本性能提升。所有评估模型在VSI-Bench上的平均准确率从34.5%提升到40.5%，提高了5.5个百分点。其中RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B达到49.6%的准确率，超越了之前的SOTA模型Spatial-MLLM。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究表明，以几何为中心的微调可以为视觉语言模型赋予广泛可迁移的空间技能。几何问题训练能够有效提升模型的空间推理能力，并具有很好的泛化性。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and
Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models (VideoLLMs) call for new
evaluation protocols and benchmarks for complex temporal reasoning in
video-language understanding. Inspired by the needle in a haystack test widely
used by LLMs, we introduce a novel task of Needle in a Montage (NeMo), designed
to assess VideoLLMs' critical reasoning capabilities, including long-context
recall and temporal grounding. To generate video question answering data for
our task, we develop a scalable automated data generation pipeline that
facilitates high-quality data synthesis. Built upon the proposed pipeline, we
present NeMoBench, a video-language benchmark centered on our task.
Specifically, our full set of NeMoBench features 31,378 automatically generated
question-answer (QA) pairs from 13,486 videos with various durations ranging
from seconds to hours. Experiments demonstrate that our pipeline can reliably

*Fankai Jia,Daisong Gan,Zhe Zhang,Zhaochi Wen,Chenchen Dan,Dong Liang,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MMRQA框架，首次将多模态大语言模型与采集感知信号处理相结合，用于MRI质量评估，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统MRI质量评估方法面临的挑战：基于信号的方法缺乏语义理解，而深度学习方法牺牲了可解释性。

Method: 结合三个关键创新：通过MRQy增强模拟伪影的鲁棒指标提取、使用Qwen将指标转化为问答对、通过LoRA高效融合LLaVA-OneVision。

Result: 在MR-ART、FastMRI和MyConnectome基准测试中实现最先进性能，具有强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过桥接定量分析与语义推理，该框架生成临床可解释的输出，增强了动态医疗环境中的质量控制。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with
strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation
studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our
framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality
control in dynamic medical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于分析患者在不同临床就诊期间病情变化的时间医学图像基准TemMed-Bench，评估发现大多数LVLM缺乏分析时间医学图像的能力，多模态检索增强能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学推理基准主要基于单次就诊图像分析，偏离了真实临床实践中医生参考患者历史病情进行综合评估的实际需求。

Method: 构建包含三个任务（VQA、报告生成、图像对选择）的测试集和超过17,000个实例的知识语料库，评估12个LVLM模型，并探索多模态检索增强方法。

Result: 大多数LVLM在时间医学图像分析上表现不佳，GPT o3、o4-mini和Claude 3.5 Sonnet相对较好但仍未达理想水平，多模态检索增强使VQA任务平均提升2.59%。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了LVLM在时间医学图像推理上的局限性，多模态检索增强是解决这一挑战的有前景方向。

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GSM8K-V，一个纯视觉多图像数学推理基准，通过将文本数学问题转换为视觉形式，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在视觉数学推理方面的显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉数学推理基准多局限于几何问题，缺乏数学文字问题的覆盖，且很少评估多图像推理能力。需要填补这些空白以推动更鲁棒的视觉语言模型发展。

Method: 通过精心设计的自动化图像生成流程结合人工标注，将广泛使用的文本基准GSM8K系统性地映射为视觉形式，构建了1,319个高质量样本。

Result: 评估显示现有视觉语言模型在文本GSM8K上接近饱和（95.22%），但在GSM8K-V上表现显著下降（仅46.93%），表明视觉数学推理仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: GSM8K-V为视觉数学推理提供了新视角，建立了指导开发更鲁棒和通用视觉语言模型的基准。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

TL;DR: PARROT是一个实用的跨系统SQL翻译基准，包含598个翻译对，覆盖22个生产级数据库系统，专门用于挑战系统特定的SQL理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SQL基准不适合SQL到SQL的评估，因为它们关注有限的数据库系统（通常只有SQLite），并且无法捕捉许多系统特定的SQL方言（如自定义函数、数据类型和语法规则）。

Method: 引入PARROT基准，包含从38个开源基准和真实业务服务中准备的598个翻译对，并提供多个基准变体：PARROT-Diverse（28,003个翻译用于广泛语法测试）和PARROT-Simple（5,306个代表性样本用于集中压力测试）。

Result: 在PARROT基准上，大型语言模型（LLMs）的平均准确率低于38.53%，表明该基准能有效挑战系统特定的SQL理解能力。

Conclusion: PARROT为跨系统SQL翻译研究提供了一个实用且现实的基准，通过公开排行榜和源代码促进未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMS) have shown increasing effectiveness in
Text-to-SQL tasks. However, another closely related problem, Cross-System SQL
Translation (a.k.a., SQL-to-SQL), which adapts a query written for one database
system (e.g., MySQL) into its equivalent one for another system (e.g.,
ClickHouse), is of great practical importance but remains underexplored.
Existing SQL benchmarks are not well-suited for SQL-to-SQL evaluation, which
(1) focus on a limited set of database systems (often just SQLite) and (2)
cannot capture many system-specific SQL dialects (e.g., customized functions,
data types, and syntax rules). Thus, in this paper, we introduce PARROT, a
Practical And Realistic BenchmaRk for CrOss-System SQL Translation. PARROT
comprises 598 translation pairs from 38 open-source benchmarks and real-world
business services, specifically prepared to challenge system-specific SQL
understanding (e.g., LLMS achieve lower than 38.53% accuracy on average). We
also provide multiple benchmark variants, including PARROT-Diverse with 28,003
translations (for extensive syntax testing) and PARROT-Simple with 5,306
representative samples (for focused stress testing), covering 22
production-grade database systems. To promote future research, we release a
public leaderboard and source code at: https://code4db.github.io/parrot-bench/.

Motivation: 研究盈利新闻稿中的文本特征如何预测盈利公告日的股票回报，探索软信息（文本内容）与硬信息（盈利惊喜）的信息价值比较。

Method: 使用2005-2023年的138,000多份盈利新闻稿，比较传统词袋模型和BERT基嵌入方法，结合在线学习进行实时回报预测。

Result: 新闻稿内容与盈利惊喜同样具有信息价值，FinBERT预测能力最高，股价在开盘时完全反映新闻稿内容，若新闻稿泄露则具有预测优势，主题分析显示管理层叙述存在自利偏见。

Conclusion: 提出的框架支持通过在线学习进行实时回报预测，提供可解释性，并揭示了语言在价格形成中的微妙作用。

Abstract: We examine how textual features in earnings press releases predict stock
returns on earnings announcement days. Using over 138,000 press releases from
2005 to 2023, we compare traditional bag-of-words and BERT-based embeddings. We
find that press release content (soft information) is as informative as
earnings surprise (hard information), with FinBERT yielding the highest
predictive power. Combining models enhances explanatory strength and
interpretability of the content of press releases. Stock prices fully reflect
the content of press releases at market open. If press releases are leaked, it
offers predictive advantage. Topic analysis reveals self-serving bias in
managerial narratives. Our framework supports real-time return prediction
through the integration of online learning, provides interpretability and
reveals the nuanced role of language in price formation.

TL;DR: 提出了CAOTE方法，通过结合注意力分数和值向量来优化token驱逐过程中的误差，提高了长上下文LLM在资源受限设备上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文支持虽然扩展了LLM能力，但也带来了内存和计算挑战。现有的基于注意力分数的token驱逐方法缺乏对token在注意力输出中贡献的信息。

Method: 提出CAOTE方法，基于缓存token对注意力输出的贡献来制定驱逐标准，在闭式形式中结合注意力分数和值向量。

Result: CAOTE与最先进的基于注意力分数的方法结合时，在下游任务上始终提高准确率。

Conclusion: 在token驱逐过程中利用值向量的信息至关重要，CAOTE可作为元启发式方法灵活应用于任何token驱逐方法。

Abstract: While long context support of large language models has extended their
abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes
crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely
adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by
evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores
as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of
attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the
information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this
paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of
cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction
error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and
value vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of
attention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as
a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We
show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based
methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the
importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs)，通过结合乘法部分和加法部分来改进曲线遍历集回归(CESR)和广义可加模型(GAMs)，在保持可解释性的同时提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗保健中，机器学习模型的可解释性至关重要。GAMs虽然可解释但忽略了高阶交互效应，CESR包含全特征交互但性能不如GAMs，需要一种既能保持可解释性又能提升性能的模型。

Method: 引入MACMs模型，包含乘法部分和加法部分：乘法部分基于CESR捕获特征交互效应，加法部分用于解耦交互项和独立项的系数，扩大假设空间。两个部分的形状函数都可以可视化。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于神经网络的MACMs在预测性能上显著优于CESR和当前最先进的GAMs。

Conclusion: MACMs通过结合乘法结构和加法结构，在保持可解释性的同时有效提升了预测性能，是对CESR和GAMs的改进。

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用无边界、固定边界或基于评分的简单边界，无法处理不同偏好的强度差异，且依赖人类难以准确提供的偏好分数。

Method: 扩展DPO方法为DPO-PoP，利用偏好强度的序数信号推断每个数据点的自适应边界，提出两种采样策略来平衡判别和生成性能。

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上，DPO-PoP在判别和生成性能上均优于原始DPO、固定边界DPO和真实边界DPO。

Conclusion: 建模偏好强度能提升泛化能力和对齐效果，但需平衡判别与生成性能的权衡关系。

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

TL;DR: 论文通过谱分析方法研究大语言模型训练过程中的几何表示变化，发现了三个一致的几何阶段：初始的表示坍缩、熵寻求阶段（维度扩展）和压缩寻求阶段（各向异性整合），这些阶段与下游任务性能提升相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准训练指标如损失无法解释大语言模型中复杂能力的涌现，需要从表示几何的角度来理解模型训练过程中的内在变化。

Method: 使用谱分析方法，测量有效秩和特征谱衰减，分析OLMo和Pythia模型在预训练和后训练过程中的表示几何变化。

Result: 发现预训练中存在三个几何阶段：暖机阶段（表示坍缩）、熵寻求阶段（维度扩展）和压缩寻求阶段（各向异性整合），后训练中SFT和DPO驱动熵寻求动态，RLVR诱导压缩寻求。

Conclusion: 语言模型的训练过程遵循特定的几何演化模式，这些模式由交叉熵优化与表示瓶颈的相互作用驱动，后训练方法对表示几何有不同影响，需要在性能与鲁棒性之间权衡。

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

Result: 在4个数据集上的实验表明，CE-PO平均比基线提高5.49%的准确率（最高9.58%），同时提高了对相关-因果翻转和轻微反事实编辑的鲁棒性

Conclusion: CE-PO有效减少了奖励黑客和不忠实推理链，同时保持接近基线的准确性，提高了模型的因果鲁棒性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often
achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct
outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal
perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a
drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a
differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from
prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal
influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these
signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with
task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single
tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates
with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and
causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful
chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and
light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results
across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on
average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation
flips and light counterfactual edits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RHYTHM是一个基于大语言模型的人类移动预测框架，通过时间标记化和分层注意力机制处理复杂的长程依赖和多尺度周期性行为，在保持预测精度的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动预测面临复杂长程依赖和多尺度周期性行为的挑战，现有方法难以有效处理这些复杂模式。

Method: 使用时间标记化将轨迹分割为日段并编码为离散标记，采用分层注意力捕获日和周依赖关系，通过预计算提示嵌入增强标记表示，并冻结预训练LLM主干以减少计算复杂度。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上评估，RHYTHM相比最先进方法实现了2.4%的整体准确率提升，周末准确率提高5.0%，训练时间减少24.6%。

Conclusion: RHYTHM框架成功地将LLM应用于人类移动预测，通过创新的时间标记化和分层注意力机制，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is

TL;DR: 提出C²GSPG方法解决强化学习在推理模型中的过度自信问题，通过置信度校准和组序列策略梯度框架提升推理性能和置信度校准效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如GRPO及其变体）在开发推理模型时存在严重的过度自信问题，阻碍了实现自我认知推理模型的目标。

Method: 提出组序列策略梯度（GSPG）框架消除token级偏差，使用归一化序列级概率定义模型置信度，应用交叉熵正则器将模型置信度校准到序列奖励。对于非二元奖励，采用非线性奖励归一化和自适应正则器裁剪。

Result: 在逻辑和数学推理任务中对大型语言模型进行后训练，C²GSPG在推理准确性和置信度校准方面均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: C²GSPG方法能有效解决强化学习中的过度自信问题，同时提升推理性能和置信度校准效果，为开发自我认知推理模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at
https://github.com/HaotianLiu123/CCGSPG.

*Bingshuai Liu,Ante Wang,Zijun Min,Liang Yao,Haibo Zhang,Yang Liu,Anxiang Zeng,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEC-RL是一个新颖的框架，通过将推测性解码与RL rollout过程集成，减少训练中的计算冗余，将rollout时间减少2-3倍而不影响策略质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加速方法（如并行化、目标驱动修改和重放缓冲区）存在收益递减、引入偏差或忽略迭代间冗余的问题。连续训练时期的rollout经常共享大量重叠段，浪费计算资源。

Method: SPEC-RL重用先前的轨迹段作为推测前缀，通过草稿-验证机制扩展它们，避免冗余生成同时确保策略一致性。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500、OlympiadBench、MMLU-STEM等数学推理和泛化基准测试中，SPEC-RL将rollout时间减少2-3倍，且不损害策略质量。

Conclusion: SPEC-RL作为纯粹的rollout阶段增强，可与主流算法（如PPO、GRPO、DAPO）无缝集成，为大规模推理模型的RLVR扩展提供了通用实用的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了机器学习模型在仅依赖过去数据的情况下能否实现对未来数据的泛化，评估了参数插值和参数外推两种方法，发现这些方法在所有场景中都无法持续优于简单使用最新模型参数的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在分布变化下往往性能下降，导致对未来数据的预测不准确。研究旨在探索仅依赖过去数据时，模型能否以及在什么条件下能够实现这种泛化。

Method: 探索了两种主要方法：过去模型参数的凸组合（参数插值）和超出过去参数凸包的显式外推（参数外推）。在多个时序任务上对这些方法进行了基准测试，包括语言建模、新闻摘要、新闻标签预测、学术论文分类、卫星图像土地用途分类和历史年鉴照片性别预测。

Result: 实证结果表明，在所有评估的场景中，没有任何一种方法能够持续优于简单使用最新可用模型参数的基线方法。

Conclusion: 在没有未来数据访问或对底层数据生成过程的稳健假设的情况下，这些结果强调了泛化和外推到未来数据的内在困难，并提醒在评估此类泛化声明时需要谨慎。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对混合专家模型的专用缩放定律，通过系统分解识别了5个关键影响因素，并构建了考虑所有必要因子的联合MoE缩放定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集模型的缩放定律不适用于MoE模型，因为MoE模型存在影响因素多、耦合关系复杂、性能影响非单调等三个关键挑战，需要专门研究MoE特定的缩放定律。

Method: 系统分解MoE设置，识别5个关键因素（数据大小D、总模型大小N、激活模型大小Na、活跃专家数G、共享专家比例S），设计446个对照实验来表征边际效应，构建全面的联合MoE缩放定律。

Result: 发现G和S的最优设置与模型架构和数据大小无关；随着N的扩展，最优激活参数比例Na/N变得更稀疏；提出了准确且具有洞察力的MoE缩放定律。

Conclusion: 提出的MoE缩放定律可以作为未来MoE模型设计和训练的准确且具有洞察力的指导。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出锚定监督微调(ASFT)方法，通过KL正则化解决动态微调(DFT)的不稳定性问题，在数学推理、医学知识和代码生成任务中优于SFT和DFT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监督微调(SFT)容易记忆化而强化学习(RL)计算成本高的问题，DFT作为折中方案在某些任务中不稳定，需要改进。

Method: 基于奖励加权回归(RWR)框架分析DFT，发现其缺乏分布锚定导致训练不稳定，提出ASFT方法，在DFT重加权基础上增加轻量级KL正则化。

Result: ASFT在数学推理、医学知识基础和代码生成任务中一致优于SFT和DFT，实现显著改进且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: RWR框架为理解后训练方法提供了系统性视角，表明理论分析既能提供更强保证也能带来实际收益。

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off
between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations
but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLMs中知识的结构组织，发现知识同质性模式，并提出基于GNN的知识性评分模型来优化知识覆盖和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知神经科学启发，研究LLMs中知识的结构组织模式，特别是知识同质性（相似实体具有相似知识水平），以改进知识密集型应用。

Method: 将LLM知识映射为图表示，分析实体与邻居的知识性关系，提出GNN回归模型预测实体级知识性分数，优先检查知识较少的triplet。

Result: 发现LLMs存在知识同质性模式，提出的GNN模型能有效预测知识性分数，在相同标注预算下最大化知识覆盖，提升多跳路径检索效率。

Conclusion: LLMs中的知识组织遵循同质性原则，基于此的GNN模型能有效优化知识注入和推理任务，为知识密集型应用提供新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural
knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as
question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of
their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience
findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact
increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an
analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM
knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视RLVR领域中的探索-利用权衡观点，认为这种权衡可能是测量层面的假象而非根本约束，希望通过在语义丰富的隐藏状态空间进行分析来揭示新的可能性。

Method: 提出Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL)方法，利用有效秩及其导数（ERV和ERA）作为预测元控制器，通过直接塑造RL优势函数来创建协同的双通道激励结构。

Result: 在多样化的LLM和推理基准测试中取得一致提升，特别是在具有挑战性的Gaokao 2024数据集上实现了21.4%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: 探索和利用在隐藏状态层面可以解耦，这为同时增强两种能力提供了机会，VERL方法成功实现了探索与利用的协同增强。

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

Motivation: 现有基于正则化的方法在长期LLM持续学习中失败的关键原因是微调过程中功能方向的漂移，导致模型在历史任务上性能下降。

Method: 提出DOC方法：追踪功能方向的漂移并动态更新；调整新任务参数梯度，使其与追踪的历史功能方向正交，减少新旧任务间的干扰。

Result: 在多个LLM持续学习基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于先前方法，有效减少灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: DOC方法为连续LLM微调提供了鲁棒工具，通过动态正交化机制成功缓解了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: MUI可作为基准性能的补充指标，为理解MoE模型的容量、动态和专业化提供新视角。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

TL;DR: 提出了Explore-Execute Chain (E²C)框架，将推理分解为探索阶段（生成高层计划）和执行阶段（执行选定计划），通过两阶段训练方法显著提升推理效率、可解释性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Chain-of-Thought及其变体在单一自回归架构中混淆高层策略规划与低层逐步执行的问题，导致计算效率低下、推理路径探索有限和可解释性降低。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方法：监督微调（SFT）结合新颖的数据生成算法强制计划遵循，随后进行强化学习（RL）阶段，利用探索的信息性并强化执行的确定性。

Result: 在AIME'2024上，E²C测试时扩展策略达到58.1%准确率，仅需不到10%的解码token；在医学基准上，探索聚焦SFT仅使用3.5%的token却比标准SFT准确率高14.5%。

Conclusion: E²C通过分离规划与执行，实现了最先进的性能、强泛化能力和更高可解释性，同时大幅降低自一致性开销。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution. This decomposition enables an
efficient test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling
reaches 58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable
methods (e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead.
For cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes
with only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher
accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art
performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating
planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is
attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world
applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further
innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths
about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and
reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and
Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEAF是一个用于少样本持续事件检测的专家混合框架，通过LoRA参数化专家、语义感知专家选择、对比学习和知识蒸馏来解决数据有限和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在严重遗忘问题，因为完全微调共享基础模型会导致任务间知识干扰，且数据增强策略可能引入不自然或语义扭曲的输入。

Method: 集成专家混合架构，每个专家使用LoRA矩阵参数化；语义感知专家选择机制动态路由实例；对比学习目标利用标签描述；知识蒸馏策略防止内存缓冲区过拟合。

Result: 在多个FCED基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LEAF始终达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LEAF通过专家专业化、语义引导对比学习和知识蒸馏，有效解决了少样本持续事件检测中的遗忘和泛化问题。

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of
learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due
to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge
interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation
strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To
address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based
framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts
architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection
mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling
expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve
generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive
learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level
semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on
the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that
transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive
experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: OrthAlign通过正交子空间分解解决LLM多目标对齐中的梯度冲突，确保不同偏好在数学上不干扰的方向进行优化，实现稳定收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM对齐面临多目标权衡困境，现有方法主要关注约束优化和数据选择，但忽略了参数层面的冲突解决。

Method: 利用正交子空间分解将参数更新空间分解为数学上不干扰的正交子空间，为不同偏好提供独立的优化方向。

Result: 在helpful、harmless和truthful维度上，单偏好最大提升34.61%-50.89%，平均整体奖励提升13.96%。

Conclusion: OrthAlign通过正交分解从根本上解决了多目标对齐中的梯度冲突问题，实现了稳定收敛和显著性能提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing
multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at
the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing
objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses
on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to
mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of
resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present
OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging
orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level
conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically
decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that
optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically
non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical
guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal
subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit
linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable
convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:
I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from
34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,
and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of
13.96%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何通过监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)提升大语言模型在序列决策中的探索能力，特别是在多臂老虎机任务上。研究发现这些方法能让模型达到与经典算法相当的性能，但可能导致更贪婪的利用策略和早期探索失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在序列决策中往往探索不足，现有研究通过SFT和RL提升其在多臂老虎机任务上的表现，但尚不清楚这些方法如何影响探索策略及其泛化能力。

Method: 使用SFT在专家轨迹上训练，以及RL配合多种定制奖励信号（包括策略性后悔形状奖励和算法模仿奖励），训练LLM在多臂老虎机任务上的表现。

Result: 训练后的智能体表现优于预训练模型，达到与UCB和Thompson Sampling相当的性能，并能泛化到6倍长的时域和不同老虎机家族。行为分析显示性能提升主要来自更复杂但更贪婪的利用策略。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了不同训练范式的适用场景，提倡定制奖励设计和超越平均后悔的评估方法，以促进稳健的探索行为。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents,
they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has
sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or
reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit
task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration
strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by
training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored
reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,
and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents
outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x
longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that
gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT
agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,
prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB
learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our
findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate
tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust
exploratory behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文证明在计算高效的LLM训练中，损失曲线可以通过简单归一化在不同规模模型上坍缩到统一轨迹，这种坍缩现象可作为训练效率的诊断工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在实用缩放配方下训练的LLM家族是否也存在损失曲线坍缩现象，以及这种现象如何反映训练效率。

Method: 通过分析不同规模模型在最优超参数设置下的训练损失曲线，验证坍缩现象的存在性，并应用于训练病理诊断和超参数调优。

Result: 当优化超参数根据数据预算最优设置时，损失曲线在不同规模模型上精确坍缩，坍缩程度可作为训练效率的敏感指标。

Conclusion: 损失曲线坍缩是计算高效LLM训练的特征标志，可用于早期诊断训练问题和指导超参数调优，作者据此训练了Celerity LLM家族验证其有效性。

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities
-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across
model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends
beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal
trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this
phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,
where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled
jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely
when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,
in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a
signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at
scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of
training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables
early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a
competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse
as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

Unlike standard CoT distillation, the approach transfers knowledge through

TL;DR: SIREN提出了一种选择性熵正则化方法，通过两步熵掩码机制限制探索范围，解决了强化学习中验证奖励方法在大型推理模型中面临的熵崩溃和过早收敛问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR方法在大型推理模型中存在熵崩溃和过早收敛问题，简单的熵正则化由于巨大的动作空间和长轨迹而失效，导致全局熵爆炸。

Method: 提出SIREN方法，包含两个熵掩码机制：top-p掩码和峰值熵掩码，将探索限制在有意义的动作和状态子集中，并采用自锚定形式的正则化来稳定训练。

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中，SIREN在平均性能上优于之前的熵相关RLVR方法，在AIME24/25上使用Qwen2.5-Math-7B实现了+6.6 maj@k的提升。

Conclusion: SIREN能促进更大的响应多样性，保持适当的熵水平，有效缓解了RLVR在大型推理模型中的过早收敛问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However,
it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.
Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in
the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of
LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space
and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion
as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To
address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method
that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN
achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a
top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed
into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical
benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous
entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on
AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes
greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which
helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively
mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

TL;DR: SIRI是一种通过交替压缩和扩展推理预算的迭代强化学习方法，能有效提升大型推理模型的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现大型推理模型存在重复思维模式，但减少这些模式往往以性能下降为代价。本文旨在克服这种权衡。

Method: 采用迭代训练机制，在压缩阶段限制推理步长迫使模型做出精确决策，在扩展阶段放宽限制让模型探索长视野推理。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上训练，SIRI-low在AIME24上性能提升43.2%同时减少46.9%的token使用；SIRI-high达到最高准确率。

Conclusion: 通过在训练中周期性调整输出截断长度，可以动态平衡推理的探索和效率，收敛到性能与效率之间的最优平衡点。

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved
Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies
have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them
often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates
between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically
adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase
cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable
decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens
and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length
limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon
settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the
model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily
pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency
trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves
performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three
iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other
methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically
oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically
balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal
"sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了MTAM，一种用于音频内容审核软件的蜕变测试框架，通过定义14种蜕变关系生成能够逃避检测的有害音频测试用例，在商业和学术模型测试中取得了显著的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频平台被滥用于传播有害内容，现有审核工具容易被恶意行为者通过修改音调或插入噪音等细微改动绕过，且现代音频审核工具对此类对抗性输入的防御效果研究不足。

Method: 开发MTAM蜕变测试框架，基于2000个音频片段进行试点研究，定义了14种蜕变关系（包括音频特征基和启发式扰动两类），应用这些关系生成能够逃避检测的有害音频测试用例。

Result: 在测试5个商业文本内容审核软件和1个学术模型时，MTAM在Gladia、Assembly AI、Baidu、Nextdata和Tencent上的错误发现率分别达到38.6%、18.3%、35.1%、16.7%和51.1%，在学术模型上达到45.7%的错误发现率。

Conclusion: MTAM框架能够有效发现音频内容审核软件的漏洞，证明现有审核系统在面对精心设计的对抗性音频时存在显著的安全隐患，需要加强防御能力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of audio-centric platforms and applications such as WhatsApp
and Twitter has transformed the way people communicate and share audio content
in modern society. However, these platforms are increasingly misused to
disseminate harmful audio content, such as hate speech, deceptive
advertisements, and explicit material, which can have significant negative
consequences (e.g., detrimental effects on mental health). In response,
researchers and practitioners have been actively developing and deploying audio
content moderation tools to tackle this issue. Despite these efforts, malicious
actors can bypass moderation systems by making subtle alterations to audio
content, such as modifying pitch or inserting noise. Moreover, the
effectiveness of modern audio moderation tools against such adversarial inputs
remains insufficiently studied. To address these challenges, we propose MTAM, a
Metamorphic Testing framework for Audio content Moderation software.
Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2000 audio clips and define 14
metamorphic relations across two perturbation categories: Audio Features-Based
and Heuristic perturbations. MTAM applies these metamorphic relations to toxic
audio content to generate test cases that remain harmful while being more
likely to evade detection. In our evaluation, we employ MTAM to test five
commercial textual content moderation software and an academic model against
three kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTAM achieves up to 38.6%,
18.3%, 35.1%, 16.7%, and 51.1% error finding rates (EFR) when testing
commercial moderation software provided by Gladia, Assembly AI, Baidu,
Nextdata, and Tencent, respectively, and it obtains up to 45.7% EFR when
testing the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy.

TL;DR: DiffTester是一个针对扩散语言模型(dLLMs)的单元测试生成加速框架，通过动态识别测试代码中的重复结构模式，在不降低质量的前提下提高生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在单元测试生成中逐个token生成效率低下，扩散LLMs虽有并行生成潜力，但面临效率与测试质量之间的权衡问题。

Method: 通过抽象语法树分析动态识别单元测试中的重复结构模式，自适应增加每步生成的token数量，同时保持输出质量。

Result: 在三个基准测试和两种代表性模型上的实验表明，DiffTester在保持测试覆盖率的同时实现了显著加速，且在不同dLLMs和编程语言上具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DiffTester为软件开发中的高效单元测试生成提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Software development relies heavily on extensive unit testing, which makes
the efficiency of automated Unit Test Generation (UTG) particularly important.
However, most existing LLMs generate test cases one token at a time in each
forward pass, which leads to inefficient UTG. Recently, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs)
have emerged, offering promising parallel generation capabilities and showing
strong potential for efficient UTG. Despite this advantage, their application
to UTG is still constrained by a clear trade-off between efficiency and test
quality, since increasing the number of tokens generated in each step often
causes a sharp decline in the quality of test cases. To overcome this
limitation, we present DiffTester, an acceleration framework specifically
tailored for dLLMs in UTG. The key idea of DiffTester is that unit tests
targeting the same focal method often share repetitive structural patterns. By
dynamically identifying these common patterns through abstract syntax tree
analysis during generation, DiffTester adaptively increases the number of
tokens produced at each step without compromising the quality of the output. To
enable comprehensive evaluation, we extend the original TestEval benchmark,
which was limited to Python, by introducing additional programming languages
including Java and C++. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with two
representative models show that DiffTester delivers significant acceleration
while preserving test coverage. Moreover, DiffTester generalizes well across
different dLLMs and programming languages, providing a practical and scalable
solution for efficient UTG in software development. Code and data are publicly
available at https://github.com/wellbeingyang/DLM4UTG-open .

Motivation: 现有的自动多智能体系统大多采用"一次生成即部署"的范式，导致系统脆弱且难以适应现实环境的动态性和不确定性。

Method: 设计了"生成器-执行器-修正器"三智能体团队，能够根据实时任务需求动态组合和自适应修正目标智能体系统，并提出了协作树优化方法来训练和专业化这些元智能体。

Result: 在7个基准测试中，MAS²在深度研究和代码生成等复杂场景下比最先进的多智能体系统性能提升高达19.6%，且具有优异的跨骨干网络泛化能力，使用未见过的LLM也能实现高达15.1%的改进，同时保持成本-性能的帕累托最优。

Conclusion: MAS²通过递归自生成范式显著提升了多智能体系统的适应性和性能，为构建更智能、更灵活的自主系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The past two years have witnessed the meteoric rise of Large Language Model
(LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS), which harness collective intelligence
and exhibit a remarkable trajectory toward self-evolution. This paradigm has
rapidly progressed from manually engineered systems that require bespoke
configuration of prompts, tools, roles, and communication protocols toward
frameworks capable of automated orchestration. Yet, dominant automatic
multi-agent systems, whether generated by external modules or a single LLM
agent, largely adhere to a rigid ``\textit{generate-once-and-deploy}''
paradigm, rendering the resulting systems brittle and ill-prepared for the
dynamism and uncertainty of real-world environments. To transcend this
limitation, we introduce MAS$^2$, a paradigm predicated on the principle of
recursive self-generation: a multi-agent system that autonomously architects
bespoke multi-agent systems for diverse problems. Technically, we devise a
``\textit{generator-implementer-rectifier}'' tri-agent team capable of
dynamically composing and adaptively rectifying a target agent system in
response to real-time task demands. Collaborative Tree Optimization is proposed
to train and specialize these meta-agents. Extensive evaluation across seven
benchmarks reveals that MAS$^2$ achieves performance gains of up to $19.6\%$
over state-of-the-art MAS in complex scenarios such as deep research and code
generation. Moreover, MAS$^2$ exhibits superior cross-backbone generalization,
effectively leveraging previously unseen LLMs to yield improvements of up to
$15.1\%$. Crucially, these gains are attained without incurring excessive token
costs, as MAS$^2$ consistently resides on the Pareto frontier of
cost-performance trade-offs. The source codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL方法显著提升了LLM的规划能力，但其有效性缺乏理论解释，需要系统分析RL在LLM规划中的优势和局限。

Method: 使用基于图的抽象模型，分析策略梯度和Q学习方法在规划任务中的表现，并在Blocksworld基准上进行实证验证。

Result: SFT会产生基于共现的伪解，RL通过探索实现正确规划；策略梯度存在多样性崩溃问题，Q学习能保持多样性且需要精心设计奖励函数。

Conclusion: 探索是RL规划成功的关键，Q学习在保持多样性和防止奖励破解方面优于策略梯度，为RL在LLM规划中的应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.

Motivation: 当前LLM机制解释研究缺乏明确原则来确定何时以及如何将从一个模型实例的发现推广到其他模型，这构成了根本的认识论挑战。

Method: 提出了五个机制声明可推广性的对应轴，并在Pythia模型（14M-410M参数）的不同随机种子中分析1-back注意力头的发展轨迹。

Result: 发现1-back注意力在不同模型中的发展轨迹具有显著一致性，但位置一致性有限；较大模型的种子系统性地表现出更早开始、更陡峭斜率和更高峰值的1-back注意力。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性研究的进展在于将LLM的构成设计属性映射到其涌现行为和机制上。

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

TL;DR: JE-IRT是一个几何项目反应框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享空间，通过几何交互确定问题正确性，提供可解释的多维评估视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LLM评估实践将多样化能力压缩为单一分数，掩盖了其固有的多维性质，需要更细致的评估方法。

Method: 构建几何项目反应框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享空间，问题嵌入的方向编码语义、范数编码难度，通过模型与问题嵌入的几何交互确定正确性。

Result: 发现分布外行为可通过方向对齐解释，较大范数对应更难问题；支持泛化，新LLM只需拟合单个嵌入；揭示的LLM内部分类与人类定义类别部分对齐。

Conclusion: JE-IRT建立了统一可解释的几何视角，连接LLM能力与问题结构，为模型评估和泛化提供独特视角。

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

*Yu Wu,Shuo Wu,Ye Tao,Yansong Li,Anand D. Sarwate*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade是一种在线交互式LLM级联系统，通过让强模型将解决方案提炼为可重用的策略来动态提升弱模型性能，显著减少对昂贵模型的调用并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM级联方法是非自适应的，面对相似或重复查询时会反复调用昂贵模型，导致成本高昂。需要一种能够动态学习并减少对强模型依赖的方法。

Method: 将强模型从备用助手扩展为长期教师，当强模型解决困难查询时，会将其解决方案提炼为通用的可重用问题解决策略，这些策略能动态提升弱模型在后续查询中的表现。

Result: 相比标准LLM级联基线，Inter-Cascade显著提升了弱模型准确率（最高33.06个百分点）和整体系统准确率（最高5.53个百分点），同时减少了对强模型的调用（相对减少48.05%）和相应费用（相对减少49.63%）。

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade展示了LLM之间有效的上下文知识传递，提供了一个适用于开源和API-based LLM的通用、可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出Agentless训练方法能够为SWE-Agent提供技能先验，通过Kimi-Dev模型在SWE-bench上取得60.4%的验证分数，并通过SFT适配使SWE-Agent达到48.6%的pass@1性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决软件工程中LLM应用的两种范式（SWE-Agent框架和Agentless方法）之间的割裂，证明它们可以相互补充，通过Agentless训练获得的技能先验能够有效提升SWE-Agent的性能。

Method: 首先制定Agentless训练方案，开发Kimi-Dev开源SWE LLM，然后在5k公开轨迹上进行额外的SFT适配，将技能先验迁移到SWE-Agent框架中。

Result: Kimi-Dev在SWE-bench Verified上达到60.4%的最佳工作流方法性能；经过SFT适配后，SWE-Agent达到48.6%的pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet性能相当。

Conclusion: 从Agentless训练中获得的结构化技能先验能够桥接工作流和智能体框架，实现可迁移的编码智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于奖励的方法和两人博弈的NLHF方法难以捕捉现实世界偏好的非传递性和异质性特征，存在单一对手偏见问题。

Method: 将对齐问题建模为n人博弈，每个策略与对手群体竞争，同时向参考模型正则化，并扩展了对偶间隙概念来量化近似质量。

Result: 在指令跟随基准测试中，MNPO持续优于现有NLHF基线方法，在异质标注者条件和混合策略评估场景下实现了更好的对齐质量。

Conclusion: MNPO为对齐LLM与复杂非传递性人类偏好提供了一个原则性和可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种无超参数的p-less采样方法，基于信息论动态设置截断阈值，在高温条件下仍能保持高质量输出


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有采样方法对超参数敏感，性能受任务类型和温度配置影响，需要一种更稳定的采样策略

Method: 基于信息论的p-less采样方法，在每个解码步骤根据整个token概率分布动态设置截断阈值，无需超参数

Result: 在数学、逻辑推理和创意写作任务中表现优于现有采样方法，在高温条件下文本质量下降较少，推理效率更高

Conclusion: p-less采样是一种有效且高效的解码策略，无需超参数调优，在各种任务和温度配置下都能保持稳定性能

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出两阶段框架改进工具集成推理，通过模式感知方法提升代码使用和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注何时调用工具，而忽视了工具如何应用的问题。识别到计算器模式和算法模式两种常见应用方式，错误的选择模式会导致失败

Method: 提出两阶段框架：首先从两种模式构建代码能力，然后将模式选择与教师偏好对齐

Result: 在挑战性数学数据集上显著提升代码使用和准确性，如MATH500上Code@1从64.0%提升到70.5%，AIME24上从26.7%提升到50.0%

Conclusion: 模式感知方法对工具集成推理非常有效，能够显著改善推理模型的性能

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在深度推理时计算成本高昂，现有强化学习方法难以在推理过程中构建短路径，限制了有效学习。研究发现模型在推理早期已积累足够信息，后续步骤冗余。

Method: JET方法在推理过程中进行轨迹截断，让模型接触分布一致的短推理路径，并使用质量控制的长度奖励来鼓励简洁推理同时保持正确性。

Result: 实验表明JET显著提高推理效率而不牺牲准确性，DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B在奥赛基准上准确率提升4.6%的同时输出长度减少46.3%。

Conclusion: JET方法通过主动终止冗余推理，有效平衡了推理效率与准确性，为大型推理模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试存在性能与能力混淆、泛化能力有限等问题，需要更有效的方法来理解基准测试的有效性和模型能力的内在联系。

Method: 通过逐步前向选择和线性回归，从32个LLM和88个基准测试中提取基准签名，这些签名是基于真实语料中的关键标记，其困惑度能预测基准性能。

Result: 发现知识推理任务高度重叠，多语言文化基准相似性较低，编码是最不重叠的领域。基准签名对问题格式等无关因素具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基准签名为理解基准有效性和LLM能力敏感性提供了机制性见解，描绘了相互关联的LLM能力底层图景。

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: 该基准强调了数据预处理在负责任AI开发中的关键但未被充分探索的作用，为改进LLM对齐提供了重要工具，并发布了所有方法的模块化实现以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在化学反应条件推荐中很少解释推荐背后的原理，这限制了它们在高风险科学工作流程中的实用性。

Method: 将条件预测重构为基于证据的推理任务，分解为机制基础、多通道召回、约束感知的智能体辩论和原理聚合四个步骤。

Conclusion: ChemMAS为科学发现中的可解释AI建立了新范式，通过多智能体系统提供基于化学知识和检索先例的可解释推荐。

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在LLM推理任务中依赖方向性先验（如奖励或优势塑形），但这些方法需要精心调参且可能因过度偏见而失败。

Method: CANON方法基于目标指标（如熵或响应长度）将采样响应分为两组，通过组间比较确定哪个指标趋势贡献更好性能，并在组内识别更好响应。

Result: 基于熵的CANON在三个LLM上对数学推理和高复杂度逻辑任务均优于先前方法；基于响应长度的CANON进一步提高了token效率，在性能-成本权衡中产生更优的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: CANON方法有效增强了目标指标的影响而不预设其方向，在提升LLM推理能力和token效率方面表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

Motivation: 当前LLM排行榜通常依赖单次随机运行，但需要多少次重复才能得出可靠结论尚不明确

Method: 在AI4Math基准上重新评估8个最先进模型，每个设置进行3次独立运行，使用混合效应逻辑回归、领域级边际均值、排名不稳定性分析和运行间可靠性评估

Result: 单次运行排行榜脆弱：83%的切片至少发生一次成对排名反转；平均运行可适度减少标准误（约5%），但大幅提升排名稳定性；两次运行可消除约83%的单次运行反转

Conclusion: 应将评估视为实验，报告不确定性，在随机解码下使用≥2次重复运行，这些实践能提高鲁棒性且对小型团队可行

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

TL;DR: 大型推理模型存在推理过程与最终答案不一致的问题，研究发现这是由于思维链推理和记忆检索两种机制同时运作导致的。作者提出了FARL框架，通过记忆遗忘和强化学习来抑制检索捷径，促进真正的推理能力发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在解决复杂问题时经常出现最终答案与自身推理过程相矛盾的现象，作者假设这是由于思维链推理和记忆检索两种竞争机制同时存在导致的。

Method: 通过设计受控实验，在推理过程中引入误导性线索和/或在检索过程中引入损坏答案，测试模型在不同条件下的表现。提出了FARL框架，整合记忆遗忘和强化学习来抑制检索捷径。

Result: 实验结果证实思维链推理和记忆检索两种机制确实同时运作，其相对主导地位受问题领域、模型规模和微调方法等因素影响。FARL框架能够有效促进推理主导行为并增强可泛化的推理能力。

Conclusion: 当前推理微调范式存在关键局限性，模型可能利用检索机制作为捷径来"破解"奖励信号，从而削弱真正的推理能力发展。FARL框架为解决这一问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FR-Ponder是一个无需修改主干模型权重的推理计算分配框架，通过潜在向量引导实现实例自适应的推理深度控制，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Best-of-N和多数投票对所有输入使用统一推理深度，导致简单问题浪费计算资源，复杂问题可能推理不足。需要一种能根据问题难度自适应分配计算的方法。

Method: 使用小于1M参数的控制器观察隐藏状态，决定停止推理或应用小步推理（通过添加预计算的引导向量到冻结表示）。采用Group Relative Policy Optimization作为奖励信号，通过课程学习和精心设计的奖励机制来调节推理深度。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，FR-Ponder改善了计算-精度边界，以更低的FLOPs获得匹配的精度，优于早期退出基线方法。分析显示学习到的计算分配与问题难度相关。

Conclusion: FR-Ponder证明了通过潜在向量引导实现实例自适应推理深度的可行性，在不修改主干模型权重的情况下有效平衡了性能与计算成本。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

TL;DR: 提出SpecExit框架，通过轻量级草稿模型直接预测未来token和提前退出信号，解决大型推理模型过度思考问题，实现66%的平均生成长度减少和2.5倍端到端延迟加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型存在过度思考问题，产生不必要长输出并导致高延迟，限制实际部署。现有提前退出机制依赖探测机制，引入检测开销限制延迟收益并影响跨问题泛化能力。

Method: 受推测解码中隐藏状态使用的启发，提出SpecExit框架，直接从轻量级草稿模型预测未来token和提前退出信号，无需探测开销。利用隐藏状态的固有信号提供有效提前退出信号。

Result: 相比推测解码基线，平均生成长度减少66%，端到端延迟加速2.5倍，且不损害准确性。

Conclusion: 隐藏状态可用于高效推理，SpecExit为大型推理模型部署提供了有效的延迟优化方案。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a
novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic
AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI
offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for
high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental
data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient
encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated
message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline,
representing a 12.2% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic
architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous

Method: 构建包含诱惑-纠正和犹豫-纠正样本的数据集，通过对抗性CoT调优教导模型进行动态自我纠正

Result: AdvChain显著增强了对越狱攻击和CoT劫持的鲁棒性，大幅减少了对良性提示的过度拒绝，实现了更好的安全-效用平衡

Conclusion: AdvChain为构建更鲁棒可靠的推理模型确立了新方向

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

Method: 在数据层面构建SCI-VerifyBench跨学科基准，涵盖数学、物理、生物、化学和通用科学QA，基于真实LLM响应并增强领域特定等价变换；在模型层面开发SCI-Verifier，通过后训练增强逻辑推理和等价判断能力。

Conclusion: SCI-VerifyBench和SCI-Verifier为科学验证提供了原则性框架，既提供系统评估，又为增强LLM在科学领域的可靠性和适用性提供了实用路径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO)方法，通过干预推理过程来提升大型推理模型的安全性，将合规步骤替换为安全触发器，并在安全基准测试中显著降低了30%以上的有害性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型的链式推理中常包含有害内容，即使最终回答看似安全，这些不安全推理仍可能被恶意用户利用，因此需要专门对齐推理过程的安全性。

Method: 提出Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO)方法，基于过程监督，通过替换合规步骤为安全触发器，构建强信号偏好学习对，来强制安全推理。

Result: 在越狱和对抗性安全基准测试中，IPO显著提升了推理和回答的整体安全性，相比SFT和RL基线方法降低了30%以上的有害性，同时保持了多样推理任务的优秀性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了显式对齐推理过程的重要性，为构建更安全的大型推理模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

Result: 在旅行商问题和装箱问题上，EvoPH相比最优解实现了最低的相对误差。

Conclusion: EvoPH推动了基于LLM的自动算法设计领域的发展。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

TL;DR: 大型推理模型在面临困难问题时会产生无效推理，浪费计算资源。研究发现模型能通过推理置信度和隐藏状态感知自身能力边界，提出了边界感知策略来避免无效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在遇到超出能力范围的问题时，会持续进行无效推理直到上下文限制，既浪费计算资源又产生错误答案。需要探索模型是否能感知自身能力边界。

Method: 通过分析推理置信度轨迹和隐藏状态来检测模型能力边界。对于黑盒模型，观察推理表达中的置信度变化；对于白盒模型，分析最后一个输入token的隐藏状态。基于这些发现提出了推理表达监控和隐藏状态监控两种优化策略。

Result: 实验表明边界感知策略能显著提高可靠性和效率，在不牺牲准确性的前提下减少62.7-93.6%的token使用量，有效避免无效推理。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型确实具有感知自身能力边界的能力，通过边界感知策略可以显著提升模型的可靠性和效率，为更智能的推理系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注数据格式转换而忽视训练样本的内部推理复杂度，导致数据的推理潜力未被充分挖掘和利用。作者认为LLM的逻辑推理性能同时受训练数据潜力和模型认知能力的约束。

Method: 引入数据推理强度(DRI)指标量化样本的潜在逻辑推理复杂度，通过分解和聚合逻辑结构进行分析。基于此提出重新认知优化策略，系统性地增强训练数据的逻辑推理强度，使其更好地与LLM的逻辑推理边界对齐。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在性能和泛化能力上显著优于以数据为中心的策略。在强化学习框架下的验证也证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 相比单纯增加数据规模或改变表面形式，优先考虑数据中的推理复杂度对于实现LLM的完整认知潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

Result: 嵌入方法能解释人类数据中55%的维度相似性方差，多维缩放配置显示良好的因子一致性系数，与基础理论相符。

Conclusion: 语义嵌入能有效复制传统心理测量结构，在成本、可扩展性和灵活性方面具有显著优势，为心理测量学和社会科学研究提供了补充方法。

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

TL;DR: RL确实能让LLMs学习真正的新技能，特别是通过组合现有技能来获得组合能力，这种能力还能迁移到其他任务上。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨RL在LLM后训练中的真实作用——是教授新技能还是仅仅激活已有能力，解决关于RL价值的争议。

Method: 使用合成框架，将技能定义为推断字符串转换函数输出，研究LLM在RL训练后能否学习未见过的函数组合h(x)=g(f(x))。

Result: RL使LLM能够学习函数组合技能，这种能力能泛化到更复杂的多函数组合，并能迁移到不同任务，而相同数据的next-token训练无法实现这些效果。

Conclusion: RL能赋予LLMs真正的新技能，建议先构建具备基础技能的基座模型，然后用RL激励高级、可泛化的复杂问题解决能力。

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

Result: 在WildChat对话数据上训练，两种RLHI变体在个性化和指令遵循方面都优于强基线，类似反馈还能提升推理基准性能。

Conclusion: 有机人类交互为个性化对齐提供了可扩展且有效的监督方式。

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型智能体在持续任务流中无法从历史交互中学习的问题，避免重复过去的错误和丢失宝贵见解。

Method: 开发ReasoningBank框架，从智能体自我评估的成功和失败经验中提取推理策略；引入MaTTS方法，通过扩展智能体的交互经验来加速和多样化学习过程。

Result: 在网络浏览和软件工程基准测试中，ReasoningBank优于存储原始轨迹或仅成功任务例程的现有记忆机制，提高了有效性和效率；MaTTS进一步增强了这些收益。

Conclusion: 建立了记忆驱动经验扩展作为新的扩展维度，使智能体能够自我进化并自然产生涌现行为。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质组学数据对疾病表型理解至关重要，但目前缺乏用于临床解释的指令调优数据集和能处理分子数据异质性的语言模型架构。

Method: 构建了包含40万+样本的CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT指令调优数据集，并提出KRONOS图-LLM框架，利用分子相互作用拓扑学习患者特异性图表示。

Result: KRONOS在分子分类、时间轨迹建模和肿瘤分期预测等临床任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法使LLMs能够理解患者层面的发病机制，通过更准确的诊断、预后和治疗分层推进精准医疗。

Abstract: Proteomics data is essential to pathogenic understanding of a disease
phenotype. In cancer, analysis of molecular signatures enables precision
medicine through the identification of biological processes that drive
individualized tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and clinical
heterogeneity. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capacity to integrate and reason across heterogeneous data
modalities. However, performing multi-modal language modeling for molecular
understanding of patient-specific proteomics remains a significant challenge
due to two barriers: (1) the lack of instruction-tuning datasets that enable
clinical interpretation from proteomics data, and (2) the absence of language
modeling architectures designed to capture the rich heterogeneity of molecular
data. In this work, we introduce CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT, the first instruction tuning
dataset for molecular understanding of oncology, comprising over 400k
open-ended examples derived from individualized proteomic profiles curated from
the largest national proteomics cancer study (CPTAC). Additionally, we propose
KRONOS (Knowledge Representation of patient Omics Networks in Oncology via
Structured tuning), a novel graph-LLM framework that leverages molecular
interaction topology with proteomics to learn patient-specific graph
representations for enhanced clinical reasoning. We show that KRONOS achieves
competitive performance across benchmark clinical tasks, including molecular
classification, temporal trajectory modeling, and tumor stage prediction from
proteomics data. Ultimately, this approach empowers LLMs to understand
patient-level pathogenesis, advancing precision medicine through more accurate
diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment stratification.

TL;DR: 开发了一个超越GTO策略的扑克模型，结合GTO防御基础和实时对手剥削，在单挑和多玩家情况下实现利润最大化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯GTO策略只能避免损失但不能保证最大利润，需要开发能够超越GTO并利用对手弱点的模型

Method: 首先通过自我对弈模拟创建接近理论最优的强基线策略，然后观察对手行为并调整策略以获取额外价值

Result: 蒙特卡洛反事实遗憾最小化(CFR)在单挑情况下表现最佳，CFR在大多数多玩家情况下仍是最强方法

Conclusion: 通过结合GTO的防御能力和实时剥削，扑克智能体可以从仅仅不输转变为持续赢利

Abstract: Game theory has grown into a major field over the past few decades, and poker
has long served as one of its key case studies. Game-Theory-Optimal (GTO)
provides strategies to avoid loss in poker, but pure GTO does not guarantee
maximum profit. To this end, we aim to develop a model that outperforms GTO
strategies to maximize profit in No Limit Holdem, in heads-up (two-player) and
multi-way (more than two-player) situations. Our model finds the GTO foundation
and goes further to exploit opponents. The model first navigates toward many
simulated poker hands against itself and keeps adjusting its decisions until no
action can reliably beat it, creating a strong baseline that is close to the
theoretical best strategy. Then, it adapts by observing opponent behavior and
adjusting its strategy to capture extra value accordingly. Our results indicate
that Monte-Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) performs best in
heads-up situations and CFR remains the strongest method in most multi-way
situations. By combining the defensive strength of GTO with real-time
exploitation, our approach aims to show how poker agents can move from merely
not losing to consistently winning against diverse opponents.

TL;DR: DiaMoE-TTS是一个基于IPA的统一方言TTS框架，通过标准化语音表示和引入方言感知的混合专家模型，解决了方言数据稀缺和语音变化复杂的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方言语音蕴含丰富的文化和语言多样性，但构建方言TTS系统面临数据稀缺、拼写不一致和复杂语音变化等挑战。

Method: 基于F5-TTS架构，使用IPA标准化语音表示，引入方言感知的混合专家模型，并采用LoRA和条件适配器进行参数高效适配。

Result: 实验表明该系统能够生成自然且富有表现力的语音，在未见过的方言和京剧等专业领域上实现零样本性能，仅需几小时数据。

Conclusion: DiaMoE-TTS实现了可扩展的、基于开放数据的语音合成，不依赖大规模或专有资源。

Abstract: Dialect speech embodies rich cultural and linguistic diversity, yet building
text-to-speech (TTS) systems for dialects remains challenging due to scarce
data, inconsistent orthographies, and complex phonetic variation. To address
these issues, we present DiaMoE-TTS, a unified IPA-based framework that
standardizes phonetic representations and resolves grapheme-to-phoneme
ambiguities. Built upon the F5-TTS architecture, the system introduces a
dialect-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to model phonological differences and
employs parameter-efficient adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptors (LoRA) and
Conditioning Adapters for rapid transfer to new dialects. Unlike approaches
dependent on large-scale or proprietary resources, DiaMoE-TTS enables scalable,
open-data-driven synthesis. Experiments demonstrate natural and expressive
speech generation, achieving zero-shot performance on unseen dialects and
specialized domains such as Peking Opera with only a few hours of data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统级联管道中语音合成被隔离的问题，实现端到端的多模态理解和可控的个性化长序列语音生成。

Method: 采用双轨令牌架构，包含统一训练策略和双音频编码器设计，以及基于分块的并行解码方案，缩小文本-语音令牌速率差距。

Result: 在保持音色一致性、生成自然上下文感知语音以及长音频多模态理解方面优于现有开源模型，且训练数据效率显著更高。

Conclusion: MGM-Omni为多模态理解和可控个性化长序列语音生成建立了高效端到端的新范式。

Abstract: We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and
expressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that
isolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a "brain-mouth" design with a
dual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal
reasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient
cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For
understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder
design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions.
For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech
token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice
cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent
work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient
training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing
open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences,
producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form
audio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient,
end-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised
long-horizon speech generation.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究使用AI模型作为"认知代理"，通过大规模相似性判断来捕捉大脑的情感几何结构。多模态大语言模型(MLLM)的30维情感嵌入能够最准确地预测人类情感处理网络的神经活动，甚至优于基于人类行为评分的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决"行为-神经鸿沟"问题，即人类自我报告在预测大脑活动方面的局限性。假设传统评分量表存在约束，而大规模相似性判断能更准确地捕捉大脑的情感几何结构。

Method: 使用AI模型（MLLM和仅语言模型LLM）作为认知代理，收集对2,180个情感诱发视频的数百万个三元组"异类排除"判断，生成30维情感嵌入表示。

Result: MLLM的情感表示在预测人类情感处理网络神经活动方面达到最高准确率，不仅优于LLM，还反直觉地优于直接来自人类行为评分的表示。情感组织主要沿分类线，但以融合维度属性的方式呈现。

Conclusion: 感官基础（从丰富视觉数据中学习）对于发展真正与神经对齐的情感概念框架至关重要。MLLM能自主发展丰富、与神经对齐的情感表示，为弥合主观体验与其神经基础之间的鸿沟提供了强大范式。

Abstract: The ability to represent emotion plays a significant role in human cognition
and social interaction, yet the high-dimensional geometry of this affective
space and its neural underpinnings remain debated. A key challenge, the
`behavior-neural gap,' is the limited ability of human self-reports to predict
brain activity. Here we test the hypothesis that this gap arises from the
constraints of traditional rating scales and that large-scale similarity
judgments can more faithfully capture the brain's affective geometry. Using AI
models as `cognitive agents,' we collected millions of triplet odd-one-out
judgments from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a language-only
model (LLM) in response to 2,180 emotionally evocative videos. We found that
the emergent 30-dimensional embeddings from these models are highly
interpretable and organize emotion primarily along categorical lines, yet in a
blended fashion that incorporates dimensional properties. Most remarkably, the
MLLM's representation predicted neural activity in human emotion-processing
networks with the highest accuracy, outperforming not only the LLM but also,
counterintuitively, representations derived directly from human behavioral
ratings. This result supports our primary hypothesis and suggests that sensory
grounding--learning from rich visual data--is critical for developing a truly
neurally-aligned conceptual framework for emotion. Our findings provide
compelling evidence that MLLMs can autonomously develop rich, neurally-aligned
affective representations, offering a powerful paradigm to bridge the gap
between subjective experience and its neural substrates. Project page:

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在部分调查数据可用时，使用微调的大型语言模型来估算自我报告的投票选择，在随机和系统性无响应情况下，微调的小型开源LLM在恢复个体预测和总体分布方面优于零样本方法，并常优于表格分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查研究者面临两个关键挑战：概率样本成本上升和缺失数据（如无响应或流失），这会削弱推断并增加便利样本的使用。

Method: 使用德国纵向选举研究数据，在部分调查响应存在的情况下，对LLM进行微调以估算自我报告的投票选择，比较零样本提示和监督微调与表格分类器（如CatBoost），并测试不同便利样本对泛化的影响。

Result: 当数据完全随机缺失时，微调的LLM与表格分类器表现相当，但优于零样本方法。当只有偏倚的便利样本可用时，微调的小型开源LLM能更准确地恢复个体预测和总体分布。

Conclusion: 微调的LLM为处理非概率样本或系统性缺失的研究者提供了有前景的策略，可能实现仅需易于获取子群体的新调查设计。

Abstract: Survey researchers face two key challenges: the rising costs of probability
samples and missing data (e.g., non-response or attrition), which can undermine
inference and increase the use of convenience samples. Recent work explores
using large language models (LLMs) to simulate respondents via persona-based
prompts, often without labeled data. We study a more practical setting where
partial survey responses exist: we fine-tune LLMs on available data to impute
self-reported vote choice under both random and systematic nonresponse, using
the German Longitudinal Election Study. We compare zero-shot prompting and
supervised fine-tuning against tabular classifiers (e.g., CatBoost) and test
how different convenience samples (e.g., students) used for fine-tuning affect
generalization.
  Our results show that when data are missing completely at random, fine-tuned
LLMs match tabular classifiers but outperform zero-shot approaches. When only
biased convenience samples are available, fine-tuning small (3B to 8B)
open-source LLMs can recover both individual-level predictions and
population-level distributions more accurately than zero-shot and often better
than tabular methods. This suggests fine-tuned LLMs offer a promising strategy
for researchers working with non-probability samples or systematic missingness,
and may enable new survey designs requiring only easily accessible
subpopulations.

TL;DR: VSSFlow是一个统一的流匹配框架，将视频到声音(V2S)和视觉文本到语音(VisualTTS)任务集成在一起，通过条件聚合机制处理不同输入信号，在两种任务上都超越了领域特定的最先进基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的视频条件声音和语音生成任务被单独处理，缺乏统一框架。现有统一尝试面临处理不同条件类型和复杂训练阶段的挑战。

Method: 使用流匹配框架，通过交叉注意力处理模糊的视频条件，自注意力处理确定的语音转录文本，采用端到端联合学习过程。

Result: VSSFlow在V2S和VisualTTS基准测试中都超越了最先进的领域特定基线，证明了统一生成模型的潜力。

Conclusion: 统一框架不仅可行，而且通过共享音频先验知识加速收敛、增强条件生成并稳定分类器自由引导过程，优于单独训练的模型。

Abstract: Video-conditioned sound and speech generation, encompassing video-to-sound
(V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) tasks, are conventionally addressed
as separate tasks, with limited exploration to unify them within a signle
framework. Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in
handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript
conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks
remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which
seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching
framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle
distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer
exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition.
Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle
different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and
self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary
to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex
training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits
from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation
without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to
the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates
convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the
classifier-free guidance process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VSSFlow surpasses the state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S
and VisualTTS benchmarks, underscoring the critical potential of unified
generative models.
