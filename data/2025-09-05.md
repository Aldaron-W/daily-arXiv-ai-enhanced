TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大语言模型在疾病检测中的适配策略，通过多种方法比较在DementiaBank语音语料库上的性能，发现适当的模型适配策略可以让开源模型达到或超越商业系统的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国过半数阿尔茫海默病患者未被诊断，语音基础的筛查方法提供了可扩展的检测途径，需要研究大语言模型的最佳适配策略来提高检测效果。

Method: 在DementiaBank语音语料库上评估了9个纯文本模型和3个多模态音频-文本模型，测试了多种适配策略：不同示例选择策略的上下文学习、推理增强提示、参数高效微调以及多模态整合。

Result: 类质心示例在上下文学习中表现最佳，推理提示对小模型有显著改善，标记级微调通常获得最高分数。添加分类头显著提升了表现较差的模型。多模态模型表现良好但未超越最佳的纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 模型适配策略（包括示例选择、推理设计和微调方法）对语音基础的疾病检测至关重要，适当适配的开源模型可以达到或超越商业系统的性能。

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [2] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA)框架，通过自合成数据和强化学习方法提升语音大语言模型(SpeechLMs)的指令跟随能力，在多项任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音大语言模型与文本大语言模型相比存在性能差距，特别是在处理动态多变的用户语音时表现不佳，需要解决跨模态差异带来的挑战。

Method: 采用自合成方法通过强大的教师LLM生成高质量对齐数据，然后使用基于强化学习的方法将SpeechLMs的行为与教师模型对齐，避免依赖人工标注的监督微调。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效提升了SpeechLMs的指令跟随能力，超越了传统蒸馏基线，在口语问答和语音转文本翻译等任务上仅使用自生成数据就达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: RBA框架能够显著改善语音大语言模型的性能，通过自合成数据和强化学习对齐方法成功缩小了与文本LLMs的性能差距，且具有良好的扩展性。

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

*Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用微调Mistral 7B大语言模型结合RAG技术进行加密货币新闻的多层次多任务分析，生成图表和文本摘要，并通过层次堆叠生成综合报告


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在加密货币新闻分析中的幻觉问题，提供互补的图表和文本视图，实现信息丰富的定性和定量分析

Method: 采用4位量化的PEFT/LoRA方法微调Mistral 7B模型，结合检索增强生成(RAG)技术，第一层生成图表和文本摘要及情感分数，高层进行层次堆叠整合

Result: 微调后的Mistral 7B模型能够有效进行加密货币新闻的多层次分析，提供重要洞察，知识图谱表示可基本消除大语言模型幻觉问题

Conclusion: 该方法展示了使用微调Mistral 7B模型进行多层次加密货币新闻分析的可行性，能够提供信息丰富的分析结果和重要见解

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProLiFIC：基于LLM构建的意大利立法过程事件日志数据集（1987-2022），用于法律流程挖掘研究


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流程挖掘在工业领域应用成熟，但在法律领域受限于数据可获取性和质量，需要高质量的法律流程数据集来推动该领域发展

Method: 从Normattiva门户网站的非结构化数据中提取信息，使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行结构化处理，构建意大利立法过程的事件日志

Result: 创建了ProLiFIC数据集，包含1987-2022年意大利立法过程的完整事件日志，为法律流程挖掘提供了基准数据集

Conclusion: ProLiFIC数据集填补了法律流程挖掘领域的数据空白，可作为基准促进该领域的新发展，展示了LLM与流程挖掘结合的应用潜力

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

### [5] [Multimodal Proposal for an AI-Based Tool to Increase Cross-Assessment of Messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03529)
*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态框架，通过分层话语树对财报电话会议进行语义丰富和结构感知的嵌入表示，整合文本、音频、视频情感信号和结构化元数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有财务情感分析系统大多采用平面文档级或句子级模型，无法捕捉财报电话会议这种半结构化金融通信的分层话语结构。

Method: 采用两阶段Transformer架构：第一阶段使用对比学习在节点级别编码多模态内容和话语元数据；第二阶段合成整个会议的全局嵌入表示。

Result: 实验结果显示生成的嵌入形成了稳定、语义有意义的表示，能够反映情感语调、结构逻辑和主题对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于财务报告，还可推广到其他高风险非脚本化通信领域，如远程医疗、教育和政治话语，为多模态话语表示提供了稳健且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 早期识别青少年自杀意念和行为的转换器模型，通过分析论坛帖子预测自杀风险，准确率达73%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年自杀是主要死因之一，但预测困难。许多案例因缺乏心理健康服务而未被发现。社交媒体提供了实时分析青少年在线表达的机会

Method: 提出Early-SIB转换器模型，逐序处理用户发布和互动的论坛帖子，预测是否会发布自杀意念内容，无需显式自我曝露作为输入

Result: 在荷兰青少年论坛上实现了平衡准确率0.73，能够在用户明确表达自杀意念之前预测自杀风险

Conclusion: 这种方法为传统自杀预防方法提供了有意义的补充，可通过社交媒体早期识别青少年自杀风险

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

### [7] [Real-Time Detection of Hallucinated Entities in Long-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03531)
*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一种基于实体级判别的假想检测方法，通过线性探针在长文本生成中实时识别假想标记，在多个模型上表现超过现有基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险应用中的假想问题可能造成严重害备，而现有检测方法要么限于短词条查询要么需要程度外部验证

Method: 通过网络搜索标注模型响应中的实体级假想，并使用线性探针训练有效的假想分类器，支持流式检测

Result: 在四个模型家族中持续超过基线方法（Llama-3.3-70B的AUC 0.90 vs 0.71），在短形式问答中也有改进，并能够泛化到数学推理任务

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展的实际假想检测提供了有前景的新途径，虽然标注过程费用较高但数据集可重用

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出UDIB方法，通过信息瓶颈原理改进语义分歧检测，用计算高效的上界替代KL散度，为LLM幻觉检测提供更敏感的工具


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分歧检测方法基于几何聚类优化空间邻近性，而非下游信息理论分析，存在脱节问题

Method: 基于确定性信息瓶颈(DIB)开发原则性主题识别方法，用计算高效上界替代难处理的KL散度项，创建UDIB算法

Result: UDIB可解释为熵正则化和鲁棒化的K-means，能生成最大化提示-响应关系信息量的共享主题表示

Conclusion: UDIB为SDM框架提供更优基础，为检测LLM幻觉提供了新颖且更敏感的工具

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

a multi-modal question generation system that can automatically generate
diverse question types from various content formats. The system features four
major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了AR²框架，通过对抗性强化学习增强大语言模型的抽象推理能力，将核心问题转化为叙事丰富的描述来训练模型提取底层计算模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成方法主要关注表面模式识别，忽视了显式的抽象能力训练，而抽象能力对于计算机科学和LLM的泛化至关重要

Method: AR²框架使用教师模型将核心问题转化为叙事丰富的挑战性描述（不改变基本逻辑），同时训练学生编码模型解决这些复杂叙事问题并提取底层计算内核

Result: 实验结果表明AR²显著提高了学生模型在未见过的挑战性编程任务上的准确性

Conclusion: 抽象能力是增强LLM泛化能力的关键技能，AR²框架有效提升了模型的抽象推理能力

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过动态构建知识图来提升LLM的事实性准确性，结合内部知识提取和外部知识检索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在产生事实一致答案时的局限性，特别是无结构化文本方法在组合推理和事实不一致性检测方面的不足

Method: 动态构建和扩展知识图：从问题中提取种子KG，通过LLM潜在知识迭代扩展，然后通过外部检索选择性精炼

Result: 在三个事实QA测试集上表现一致提升，在事实准确性、答案精确度和可解释性方面超过基线方法

Conclusion: 推理时知识图构建是提升LLM事实性的有前景方向，具有结构化、可解释性和可扩展性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

Conclusion: 提出了多文档科学推理的新任务和解决方案，通过ResearchPulse框架有效解决了跨文档内容提取和对齐的挑战，并发布了相应的基准数据集。

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

TL;DR: 本文比较了5种先进大视觉语言模型和2种传统OCR系统在边缘部署场景下的性能，发现传统OCR系统在资源受限环境中仍具优势，Sprinklr-Edge-OCR在效率和成本方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言、噪声、多样化真实场景图像中的OCR挑战，评估大视觉语言模型在边缘部署环境中的适用性，为资源受限环境寻找最优OCR解决方案。

Method: 构建Sprinklr-Edge-OCR系统，在包含54种语言的双重人工标注数据集上，对5种LVLM和2种传统OCR系统进行大规模比较评估，涵盖准确性、语义一致性、语言覆盖、计算效率和部署成本等多个指标。

Result: Qwen获得最高精确度(0.54)，Sprinklr-Edge-OCR获得最佳F1分数(0.46)，处理速度比LVLM快35倍(平均每图0.17秒)，成本仅为LVLM的0.01(每千图0.006美元)。

Conclusion: 在边缘部署场景中，传统OCR系统由于低计算需求、低延迟和高经济性，仍然是比大语言模型更优的选择，即使在LLM时代也是如此。

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自动评估器时存在自我偏好偏见，倾向于偏爱自身输出而非其他模型输出，这影响了评估管道的公平性和可靠性，特别是在偏好调优和模型路由等任务中。

Method: 构建区分合理与不合理自我偏好的数据集，使用对比激活加法(CAA)和基于优化的方法构建导向向量，在推理时进行干预而不需要重新训练模型。

Result: 导向向量可将不合理自我偏好偏见减少高达97%，显著优于提示和直接偏好优化基线方法，但在合理自我偏好和无偏见一致性方面表现不稳定。

Conclusion: 导向向量作为LLM作为评判者的安全保障措施具有前景但也存在局限性，自我偏好可能涉及多个或非线性方向，需要更稳健的干预方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

*Ali Noori,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索SNOMED CT概念共现模式与嵌入语义相似性的关系，发现两者弱相关但互补，嵌入能捕获临床意义关联并辅助概念标注完善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记的非结构化特性限制了大规模分析，标准化术语如SNOMED CT改善了互操作性，但概念间通过共现和语义相似性的关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用MIMIC-IV数据库，使用标准化点互信息(NPMI)和预训练嵌入(ClinicalBERT、BioBERT)分析概念共现模式与语义相似性的关系，并研究时间演变和专科差异。

Result: 共现与语义相似性弱相关；嵌入能捕获文档频率未反映的临床关联；嵌入建议常匹配后续记录的概念；概念嵌入聚类产生连贯临床主题；共现模式与死亡率和再入院等结局相关。

Conclusion: 共现统计和语义嵌入在改善文档完整性、发现潜在临床关系、支持决策和表型应用方面具有互补价值。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨目标和跨领域立场检测中的领域适应问题，传统方法在新目标领域表现不佳，需要能够有效利用新领域样本的方法

Method: 使用度量学习和三元组损失来捕捉立场目标之间的语义相似性和差异性，构建判别性嵌入空间，使模型能够从新目标领域获取有用样本

Result: 在多个跨目标和跨领域场景下的两个数据集上评估，相比六种广泛使用的立场检测模型，在立场检测性能上显示出统计显著的改进

Conclusion: MLSD方法通过度量学习有效提升了跨领域立场检测的性能，为少样本学习场景下的立场检测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SiLVERScore，一种基于语义感知嵌入的手语生成评估指标，直接在联合嵌入空间中评估手语生成，避免了传统回译评估方法的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手语生成评估采用回译方法（生成的手语先识别回文本，再用文本指标比较），这种方法存在两个问题：1）无法捕捉手语的多模态特性（面部表情、空间语法、韵律）；2）难以区分评估错误是来自生成模型还是翻译系统。

Method: 提出SiLVERScore指标，在联合嵌入空间中进行语义感知评估。该方法能够处理语义和韵律变化，并探索跨数据集的泛化挑战。

Result: 在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上，SiLVERScore实现了近乎完美的正确-随机对区分能力（ROC AUC = 0.99，重叠率 < 7%），显著优于传统指标。

Conclusion: SiLVERScore提供了一种更直接、更准确的手语生成评估方法，能够更好地捕捉手语的多模态特性，解决了传统回译评估的模糊性问题。

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个四指标的评估套件，用于系统评估大规模视觉语言模型在交互式基础设置中的表现，发现当前模型在多个指标上都与人类表现存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的评测标准主要在单轮或问答场景中评估VLMs，而基础设置是一个交互过程，需要通过持续沟通形成共享理解。

Method: 提出四个指标（基础效率、内容对齐、词汇适应性和人类相似度）来系统评估VLM在交互式基础中的表现，在150个自我游戏会话中部署套件，对比三个专有VLM与人类对组的表现。

Result: 三个模型都在至少三个指标上与人类模式存在分差，GPT4o-mini整体最接近人类。发现：（1）任务成功分数不能表示成功基础；（2）高图像-语句对齐度不一定预测任务成功。

Conclusion: 该指标套件和发现为未来VLM基础研究提供了框架，强调了需要更全面的评估方法来量化模型在交互场景中的真实表现。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Align-then-Slide框架，用于评估超长文档级机器翻译，通过自动对齐和滑动窗口评估解决传统句子级评估的局限性，与人工评估高度相关，并能用于训练更好的翻译模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)带来了文档级机器翻译的新时代，但其整文档输出挑战了现有的基于句子对齐的评估方法，需要新的评估框架来处理遗漏和多对一/一对多映射问题。

Method: Align-then-Slide框架包含两个阶段：1)Align阶段自动推断句子级源-目标对应关系并重建目标文本；2)n-Chunk滑动评估阶段计算1-4个chunk的平均指标得分进行多粒度评估。

Result: 在WMT基准测试中与专家MQM排名的Pearson相关性达到0.929；在新构建的真实测试集上也与人工判断高度一致；生成的偏好数据可用于CPO训练和作为GRPO的奖励模型，产生优于普通SFT基线的翻译。

Conclusion: 该框架为文档级机器翻译系统提供了一个准确、稳健且可操作的评估工具，能够有效解决长文档翻译评估的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了NE-PADD方法，通过语音命名实体识别和注意力机制来提升部分音频深度伪造检测的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的句子级音频深度伪造检测无法精确定位伪造位置，而利用音频中的语义信息（特别是命名实体）在部分音频深度伪造检测中尚未充分探索

Method: 提出NE-PADD方法，包含两个并行分支：语音命名实体识别(SpeechNER)和PADD检测，采用注意力融合(AF)和注意力转移(AT)两种注意力聚合机制

Result: 在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 证明了在部分音频深度伪造检测中整合命名实体知识的有效性

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

TL;DR: 论文提出"废话学"概念，研究语法连贯但语用矛盾的语言现象，发现当前大语言模型无法理解此类深层语义，构建了包含1200多个多语言样本的基准数据集进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在理解具有深层语义的"废话学"文本时的局限性，这类文本表面看似无意义但实际上包含需要语境推理、道德判断或情感解读的隐含意义。

Method: 构建包含1200多个精心筛选的多语言样本数据集（英语、中文、西班牙语、法语、日语、韩语），经过多轮专家评审和裁决。评估多种大语言模型在分类、生成和推理任务上的表现。

Result: 大语言模型存在明显局限：经常将"废话学"与浅层无意义文本混淆，产生不连贯的辩解，或完全忽略隐含的修辞功能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大语言模型在语用理解方面存在深层的表征差距，挑战了统计流畅性意味着认知理解的假设，为超越表面连贯性的语言深度建模研究提供了基础。

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维链推理技术提升了LLM在各种任务上的表现，但其对语言模型可信度影响的系统性研究仍不充分，需要全面评估推理模型在可信度维度上的表现。

Method: 采用文献综述方法，按时间顺序系统梳理推理模型和CoT技术的最新研究，对每个可信度维度进行结构化概述，详细分析方法论、发现和局限性。

Result: 研究发现推理技术在缓解幻觉、检测有害内容和提升鲁棒性方面有潜力，但最先进的推理模型本身在安全性、鲁棒性和隐私性方面存在可比甚至更严重的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 本文为AI安全社区提供了关于推理可信度最新进展的宝贵资源，强调了在推进推理技术的同时需要关注模型可信度问题，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

TL;DR: 本文系统性地重新审视了基于探测的LLM安全检测方法，发现这些方法主要学习表面模式而非语义有害性，存在虚假的安全感


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对LLM可能遵循有害指令的安全问题，现有研究使用探测方法来检测恶意输入，但作者发现这些方法在分布外性能较差，怀疑其学习的是表面模式而非语义内容

Method: 通过控制实验系统分析：首先比较简单n-gram方法的性能，然后使用语义清理的数据集进行控制实验，最后详细分析模式依赖性

Result: 确认探测方法主要学习指令模式和触发词等表面模式，而非语义有害性，揭示了当前探测方法存在的虚假安全感

Conclusion: 需要重新设计模型和评估协议，为负责任的安全研究方向提供建议

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

Motivation: 现有移动代理存在三个主要问题：1)过度依赖LLM理解能力导致操作错误 2)缺乏与外部环境交互 3)缺乏记忆能力无法学习纠正错误

Method: 提出MobileRAG框架，包含InterRAG（交互式RAG）、LocalRAG（本地RAG）和MemRAG（记忆RAG）三个组件，利用RAG技术快速准确识别用户查询并完成复杂移动任务

Conclusion: MobileRAG通过RAG增强有效解决了当前移动代理的局限性，在复杂移动任务处理上表现出色，为移动智能助手发展提供了新方向

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Conclusion: MoT框架通过创新的矩阵式思考结构和知识增强机制，显著提升了LLM在复杂问答任务中的推理能力和效率，为NLP领域的复杂问题解决提供了新思路。

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在文本情感分类方面取得显著进步，但韩国诗歌因其比哭性语言和文化特定性而研究不足

Method: 构建多标签情感数据集，包含7,007条行级和615条作品级注释，使用44个细粒度情感类别，采用分序列精调策略（先通用语料后KPoEM数据集）

Result: 精调后的韩语模型显著超过之前模型，F1微指标达到0.60（之前为0.34），能够识别时间和文化特定的情感表达

Conclusion: 该研究域了计算方法与文学分析，通过结构化数据为诗歌情感的定量探索提供了新可能性，实现了对韩国文学情感和文化细节的忠实保留

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推进了对RAG背景下灾难性遗忘的理解，还提供了一个适用于各种微调场景的实用解决方案

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

*Yuhao Zhang,Shaoming Duan,Jinhang Su,Chuanyi Liu,Peiyi Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL是一种针对Text-to-SQL任务的自博弈微调方法，通过验证驱动的迭代微调和错误驱动损失机制，解决了传统SPIN方法在SQL生成中的局限性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自博弈微调(SPIN)在Text-to-SQL任务中存在局限性：无法生成新信息，且对手模型产生的大量正确SQL查询会降低主模型生成准确SQL的能力。

Method: 提出SPFT-SQL方法：1）自博弈前采用验证驱动的迭代微调，基于数据库模式和验证反馈合成高质量数据；2）自博弈阶段引入错误驱动损失机制，激励对手模型产生错误输出，帮助主模型区分正确和错误SQL。

Result: 在6个开源大语言模型和5个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL通过创新的验证迭代微调和错误驱动机制，有效提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，为自博弈微调在该领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Weihao Wu,Liang Cao,Xinyu Wu,Zhiwei Lin,Rui Niu,Jingbei Li,Zhiyong Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoxRole是首个专门用于评估基于语音的角色扮演对话代理的综合性基准，包含13335个多轮对话、65.6小时语音数据，涵盖1228个独特角色，解决了该领域缺乏标准化评估基准的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演对话代理研究存在双重局限：一是主要关注文本模态，忽略了语音中的副语言特征；二是缺乏标准化的评估基准，现有语音数据集无法有效量化模型在长期角色一致性等核心能力上的表现。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的两阶段自动化流程：首先将电影音频与剧本对齐，然后使用LLM为每个角色系统地构建多维度角色档案，从而构建VoxRole基准数据集。

Result: 基于VoxRole对当代语音对话模型进行了多维度评估，揭示了这些模型在保持角色一致性方面的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: VoxRole填补了语音角色扮演领域的关键空白，为评估基于语音的角色扮演对话代理提供了首个全面的基准，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型被越来越多地用于事实核查，但其在中文谣言检测方面的有效性仍不确定，需要系统评估

Method: 构建包含约2万个标注实例的中文谣言数据集CANDY，使用思维链推理和少样本提示等方法测试LLMs的事实核查能力

Result: 当前大语言模型在生成准确事实核查结论方面存在局限，事实捏造是最常见的失败模式，但作为人类辅助工具时表现有显著提升

Conclusion: 大语言模型单独用于事实核查不可靠，但在作为辅助工具部署时具有增强人类性能的很大潜力

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极低资源语言（如拉丁语）缺乏高质量NLP数据集的问题，提升大语言模型在这些语言上的表现

Method: 利用少量并行拉丁语-意大利语句子对，通过翻译单语意大利语数据构建合成数据集，并采用严格过滤和反向翻译程序确保语言质量

Result: 构建了首个公开的拉丁语情感分析和MCQA数据集，将合成数据集集成到机器翻译训练中显著提升了现有基线的性能

Conclusion: 为缘危语言拉丁语创建了基础性NLP资源，为更广泛的NLP研究和下游应用支持了这种代表性不足的语言

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

TL;DR: RTQA是一个无需训练的TKGQA框架，通过递归分解问题、自底向上求解和多路径答案聚合来提升时序知识图谱问答性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TKGQA方法主要关注隐式时序约束，缺乏处理复杂时序查询的能力，且在分解框架中存在推理能力有限和错误传播问题

Method: RTQA包含三个核心组件：时序问题分解器、递归求解器和答案聚合器，通过递归思维将问题分解为子问题，使用LLMs和TKG知识自底向上求解

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA基准测试中，RTQA在"Multiple"和"Complex"类别上显著提升了Hits@1指标，优于最先进方法

Conclusion: RTQA框架有效解决了TKGQA中的复杂时序查询处理问题，通过递归分解和多路径聚合提高了推理能力和容错性

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了大型语言模型对改写后基准问题的鲁棒性，发现虽然模型排名相对稳定，但绝对性能显著下降，表明当前基准评估可能无法充分反映模型在现实世界中的实际能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估主要使用固定格式的基准测试，但现实应用涉及语言变异性，需要研究模型对不同改写问题的鲁棒性，以及基准评估的可靠性。

Method: 系统生成六个常见基准测试中所有问题的各种改写版本，并测量34个最先进LLM在改写前后的效果变化。

Result: LLM在改写输入下的排名相对稳定，但绝对效果分数显著下降，表明模型在处理语言变异性方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 基准评估的可靠性受到挑战，需要开发能够更好反映实际部署场景的鲁棒性感知基准测试方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

Method: 基于RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext模型，使用4,100条人民日报语料构建训练数据集，通过命名实体识别任务实现功能语法注释。

Result: 模型在测试集上获得0.852的F1分数，显著超过其他对比模型，在核心语法元素识别上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为中文功能语法自动分析提供了新方法，为后续研究奠定了基础，但在标签样本不均衡的实体识别上仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

Conclusion: 本研究为阿拉伯语教育聊天机器人领域提供了完整的评估案例，并指出了未来研究的方向，希望能够推动该领域的进一步发展

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19
pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies
to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

Conclusion: 该方法在媒体分析、教育和情报收集等领域具有应用价值，通过结构化知识提高了NLP系统的性能。

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Conclusion: 研究提供了构建稳定个性化词汇模型的实用方法，为会话助手的词汇对齐策略奠定了基础

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

*Aishik Mandal,Tanmoy Chakraborty,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAGneT是一种新的多模态框架，通过将心理咨询响应生成分解为专门子任务，各由专门的LLM模型处理，生成更高质量的合成心理咨询数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可扩展心理咨询对高质量、隐私合规数据的需求，而现有数据缺乏。

Method: 使用多模态框架，将咨询响应生成分解为协调子任务，每个子任务由专门模型处理具体心理技巧。提出统一评估框架，从4个方面扩展到9个方面。

Result: MAGneT在质量、多样性和治疗对齐方面显著超过现有方法：普通咨询技能提高3.2%，CBT特定技能提高4.3%，专家在77.2%的情况下偏好MAGneT。使用MAGneT数据微调模型在普通咨询技能和CBT特定技能上分别提高6.3%和7.3%。

Conclusion: MAGneT框架能够生成更高质量的合成心理咨询数据，为微调开源LLM模型提供了更好的数据来源，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

TL;DR: SED-Aug是一个即插即用的双增强框架，通过显式文本增强和隐式特征空间增强来解决社交媒体事件检测中标注数据稀缺的问题，在两个Twitter数据集上F1分数显著提升超过15%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体事件检测依赖标注数据，但人工标注成本高且耗时，需要一种有效的数据增强方法来提升模型性能。

Method: 提出双增强框架：1）显式文本增强使用大语言模型进行5种文本生成策略；2）隐式特征空间增强设计5种新颖的扰动技术，在结构融合嵌入上操作以保持语义和关系属性。

Result: 在Twitter2012数据集上平均F1分数比最佳基线模型提升约17.67%，在Twitter2018数据集上提升约15.57%。

Conclusion: SED-Aug框架通过结合显式和隐式增强有效提升了社交媒体事件检测的性能，解决了标注数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在监督微调后表现出认知惯性，难以遵循与训练模式相冲突的指令，需要评估和改善这种局限性。

Method: 设计包含8种反直觉挑战类型的基准测试，通过人工参与流程构建1012个高质量问题，使用优化的LLM-as-a-Judge框架进行评估。

Result: 实验表明现有领先LLMs在反直觉指令遵循方面存在困难，验证了该基准的必要性。

Conclusion: 未来对齐工作不仅要追求流畅性和事实正确性，还应考虑非常规情境下的适应性，该基准可作为诊断工具和开发方法的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 该研究创建了两个医学问答数据集来评估LLMs在医学知识更新方面的表现，发现所有主流模型都存在依赖过时知识的问题，并分析了原因和提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用潜力巨大，但其依赖静态训练数据的特性可能导致提供过时的医疗建议，存在安全隐患。需要系统评估LLMs处理医学知识更新的能力。

Method: 构建了两个新颖的问答数据集：MedRevQA（16,501个QA对，涵盖一般生物医学知识）和MedChangeQA（512个QA对，专门针对医学共识随时间变化的案例）。评估了8个主流LLM在这些数据集上的表现。

Result: 所有评估的LLM都表现出对过时知识的一致依赖，无法有效处理医学共识变化的情况。分析了过时预训练数据和训练策略对这种现象的影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在医学知识更新方面的重要局限性，为开发更及时可靠的医疗AI系统奠定了基础，并提出了未来缓解这一问题的方向。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

*Jiajun He,Naoki Sawada,Koichi Miyazaki,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO是一个通过音素增强和对比实体消歧的上下文ASR方法，显著提升了特定领域命名实体的识别准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ASR系统在领域特定命名实体（特别是同音词）识别上的困难，以及现有方法在处理多token实体和音素变体时的局限性

Method: 提出PARCO框架，整合音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤，增强音素区分能力并确保完整实体检索

Result: 在中文AISHELL-1上达到4.22%的CER，英文DATA2上达到11.14%的WER（1000个干扰项下），显著优于基线方法

Conclusion: PARCO通过音素增强和对比学习有效提升了上下文ASR的性能，在领域内和跨域数据集上都表现出强劲的鲁棒性

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，LLM性别偏见评估对提示词变化极其敏感，微小的提示调整就能显著改变甚至逆转偏见测量结果，这质疑了现有评估方法的生态效度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会影响场景中的广泛应用，性别偏见问题日益受到关注。现有评估方法通常使用特殊构造的任务提示来测量偏见，但这些提示可能与自然语言分布不同，可能触发模型的"测试模式"。

Method: 研究测试了在不同提示条件下的模型表现：(1)突出测试背景的提示，(2)突出性别相关内容的提示。使用四种任务格式，结合概率度量和离散选择度量进行评估。

Result: 研究发现即使微小的提示变化也能显著改变偏见测量结果，有时甚至完全逆转偏见方向。离散选择度量倾向于放大偏见相比概率度量。

Conclusion: LLM性别偏见评估具有脆弱性，提示敏感性对评估结果的生态效度构成挑战，这为NLP基准测试社区提出了新的难题：如何设计既能控制测试又能保持生态有效性的评估方法。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性评估了开源语言模型在日本历法处理能力上的表现，发现即使日语专注模型也在日历运算和多历法一致性方面遇到困难，强调了发展具备文化特定历法理解能力的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的研究分析和改善了语言模型的时态推理能力，但大多数研究只关注公历（格林威治历）。但许多非公历系统（如日本历、希吉来历、希伯来历）仍在活跃使用且反映文化根基的时间概念。目前尚未评估现有语言模型在处理这类非公历系统旹的表现。

Method: 创建了四个需要时态知识和时态推理的任务数据集，对一系列英语中心和日语中心的开源语言模型进行系统性评估，以日本历作为非公历系统的研究对象。

Result: 发现某些模型能够进行历法转换，但即使是日语专注模型也在日本历运算和多历法之间保持一致性方面遇到困难。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了发展具备更好文化特定历法理解能力的语言模型的重要性，应该重视非公历系统在语言模型中的表现。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种新颖的多模态参数高效适应技术，通过奇异值分解(SVD)修改CLIP内部参数空间，仅需微调0.04%的参数即可实现领域适应，在11个自然和10个生物医学数据集上达到最先进的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs适应方法依赖提示工程和完整模型微调，成本高且可能限制适应质量、破坏模型稳定性并损害预训练获得的知识。

Method: 利用奇异值分解(SVD)技术，仅微调CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值来重新缩放基向量，实现领域适应而不注入额外模块。

Result: 在few-shot设置下，CLIP-SVD在11个自然数据集和10个生物医学数据集上实现了最先进的分类结果，在准确性和泛化能力方面均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD提供了一种参数高效、性能优越且可解释的CLIP适应方法，能够更好地保持模型的泛化能力，同时显著减少需要微调的参数量。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

TL;DR: SPECS是一个针对长图像描述任务设计的无参考评估指标，通过改进CLIP模型来强调描述的具体性，在保持与人类判断高度相关的同时大幅提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标存在不足：n-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，基于表示的相似性指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，LLM指标虽然相关性好但计算成本过高，不适合模型开发中的迭代评估

Method: 基于CLIP模型进行改进，引入新的目标函数来强调描述的具体性：奖励正确细节并惩罚错误细节，从而构建SPECS指标

Result: SPECS在相关性方面与开源LLM指标相当，但计算效率显著更高，适合在图像描述模型开发过程中进行迭代检查点评估

Conclusion: SPECS提供了一个实用高效的替代方案，能够在长图像描述任务中实现与人类判断高度相关且计算成本较低的评估

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大型多模态模型在多选题答题中的提示设计理论基础薄弱，且提示语的微小变化会导致模型性能的显著波动，影响评估的公平性和透明性。

Method: 提出Promptception框架，包含61种提示类型（涵盖15个类别和6个超级类别），用于评估10个大型多模态模型在3个多选题测试集上的表现。

Result: 发现专有模型对提示语语法更敏感（反映了与指令语义的更紧密对齐），而开源模型更稳定但在细致复杂语法上表现较差。

Conclusion: 基于分析结果提出了针对专有和开源模型的提示原则，以支持更稳健和公平的模型评估。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

Motivation: 当前的风险导向数据集构建方法无法覆盖日益复杂的真实多模态安全场景，且缺乏统一的评估指标来验证其整体效果。

Method: 提出了一种基于图像的自适应数据集构建方法，从图像出发构建配对文本和指导响应，自动生成了35k张图像-文本对的RMS数据集，并提出通过微调安全判断模型来评估安全数据集的标准化指标。

Result: 在多种任务上进行了广泛实验，结果证明了基于图像的方法具有可扩展性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为真实多模态安全数据集的构建提供了新的视角，通过图像导向的自适应方法和标准化评估指标，有效解决了当前多模态大语言模型面临的安全挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

TL;DR: 该文章提出了UCF-UM评估框架，通过周期性的图像-文本-图像轮换来量化统一模型在视觉理解和生成任务中的语义漏泄问题，补充了传统单次评测的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法将视觉理解(I2T)和生成(T2I)能力分开评测，无法反映模型在多次交互中的语义一致性和模态间表征的稳定性。

Method: 设计了UCF-UM周期评估协议，通过多轮I2T和T2I交互来量化语义漏泄，包括三个指标：平均累计漏泄(MCD)、语义漏泄率(SDR)和多代生成评估(MGG)。使用ND400数据集进行测试。

Result: 在7个现有模型上进行测试，发现模型间存在显著差异：BAGEL模型在多次交互中能保持语义稳定性，而Vila-u模型虽然单次评测成绩优秀但快速出现语义漏泄。

Conclusion: 周期一致性评估是补充标准I2T和T2I评测的必要手段，UCF-UM框架为评估统一模型的跨模态稳定性和共享表征强度提供了实用的量化指标。

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

TL;DR: 研究通过简历筛选实验发现，当人们与存在种族偏见的AI系统协作时，会显著地受到AI偏见的影响，即使他们认为AI建议质量低或不重要。完成隐性联想测试(IAT)可以减少这种影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查人们在与存在种族偏见的AI系统协作时的行为变化，以及隐性联想测试(IAT)在人工智能协作决策中的作用。

Method: 进行简历筛选实验(N=528)，使用模拟的存在种族偏见的AI模型，评估16种高低地位职业的候选人。通过名字和联谋团体表示不同种族候选人，在1,526个场景中测量参与者的选择。使用隐性联想测试(IAT)测量无意识的种族-地位联系。

Result: 在没有AI或无偏见AI的情况下，人们选择所有候选人的比例相同。但与偏向某种族的AI协作时，人们选择该种族候选人的比例高达90%。先完成IAT测试的人选择不符合种族-地位定型候选人的可能性提高13%。即使认为AI建议质量低或不重要，人们的决策仍受AI偏见影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了人工智能协作决策的复杂性，建议组织和监管政策应考虑这种复杂性，在实施系统、培训使用者和确定监管范围时重视AI-HITL决策机制。

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people
collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)
to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI
bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in
real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,
Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups
on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their
unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association
tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been
investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or
with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates
at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,
people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a
significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose
identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%
if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if
people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their
decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This
work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,
design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias
in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and
regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision
making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and
determining which are subject to oversight.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明语音自监督学习模型（如HuBERT、WavLM、XEUS）在生物声学检测和分类任务中表现出色，其潜在表示对动物声音具有丰富表征能力，性能可与专门训练的模型媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语音自监督模型在非语音数据（特别是生物声学数据）上的迁移学习能力，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 使用线性探测分析时间平均表示，并扩展到时序信息处理的下游架构，研究频率范围和噪声对性能的影响。

Result: 模型在不同分类群的动物声音上生成丰富的潜在表示，结果与微调的生物声学预训练模型竞争相当，并显示噪声鲁棒预训练设置的影响。

Conclusion: 语音自监督学习为生物声学研究提供了高效框架，具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient
framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了统一策略梯度估计器，将强化学习和监督微调统一到同一优化框架下，并提出了混合后训练算法HPT，在数学推理任务上取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言模型后训练主要使用在线数据（模型生成）和离线数据（人类示范），分别对应RL和SFT方法。本文旨在证明这两种方法本质上是同一优化过程的不同实例

Method: 推导了统一策略梯度估计器，将各种后训练方法表示为不同数据分布假设下的梯度计算。提出了混合后训练算法HPT，动态选择不同的训练信号

Result: 在6个数学推理基准和2个分布外测试集上，HPT在不同规模和系列的模型上都 consistently 超越了强基线方法

Conclusion: RL和SFT方法在理论上是统一的，HPT算法能够有效利用示范数据并保持稳定探索，不牺牲已学习到的推理模式

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

TL;DR: Delta Activations是一种通过测量微调模型相对于基础模型内部激活变化来表示模型的方法，能够将微调模型表示为向量嵌入，便于聚类和分析模型景观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型的成功使得社区创建了大量针对特定任务和领域的微调模型，但由于元数据不一致和存储库非结构化，导航和理解这些模型变得困难。

Method: 通过测量微调模型相对于基础模型的内部激活偏移，将微调模型表示为向量嵌入，支持基于领域和任务的聚类分析。

Result: Delta Activations在不同微调设置下具有鲁棒性，当微调数据集混合时表现出可加性，可用于few-shot微调任务嵌入、模型选择和模型合并。

Conclusion: Delta Activations方法有助于促进公开可用模型的重用实践，为模型管理和理解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决AI系统在有限数据和分布偏移情况下适应新问题的推理能力，需要建立一个能够系统评估这种能力的测试平台。

Method: 基于结构因果模型构建完全指定的因果世界模型，通过原则性数据增强提供观测、干预和反事实反馈，作为少样本上下文学习演示。

Result: 成功开发了CausalARC测试平台，并在四个语言模型评估场景中进行了概念验证：测试时训练的抽象推理、上下文学习的反事实推理、程序合成以及因果发现与逻辑推理。

Conclusion: CausalARC为评估AI系统在低数据和分布外环境下的推理能力提供了一个系统化的测试框架，特别是在因果推理方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理方面容易出错，缺乏类似人类的稳健心理表征，需要将理解建立在具身认知结构上。

Method: 开发基于图像图式的神经符号系统，使用答案集编程进行声明式空间推理，将认知结构形式化为可执行程序。

Result: 实验证明LLMs可以通过具身认知结构解释场景，这些结构可以形式化为程序，支持有效的逻辑推理并提高可解释性。

Conclusion: 虽然当前实现专注于空间原语，但为整合更复杂动态的表征建立了计算基础，展示了神经符号方法在增强LLM推理能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了RL提升LLM推理能力的机制，发现推理层次结构的存在，并提出HICRA算法专注于规划token来提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RL能有效提升大语言模型的复杂推理能力，但其成功背后的机制仍不明确，需要深入理解RL训练过程中的关键现象和动态

Method: 通过分析发现推理层次结构，提出HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA)算法，专注于优化高影响力的规划token，并使用语义熵作为战略探索的度量指标

Result: HICRA显著优于强基线方法，证明关注战略瓶颈是解锁高级推理的关键，语义熵被验证为比token级熵更优越的战略探索度量指标

Conclusion: RL训练中存在明显的两阶段动态，传统RL算法效率低下，通过层次感知的信用分配可以显著提升推理性能，语义熵是衡量战略探索的有效指标

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性研究了大语言模型的人格特征，发现指令对齐能稳定特质表达，但自我报告的人格特征无法预测实际行为，人设注射也不能有效改变行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型的人格特征模式对对齐和可解释性至关重要，但之前研究主要依赖简化的自我报告和启发式提问，缺乏行为验证。

Method: 从三个维度系统分析LLM人格：(1)训练过程中特质模式的动态演化；(2)自我报告特质在行为任务中的预测效度；(3)人设注射对自我报告和行为的影响。

Result: 指令对齐显著稳定了特质表达并加强特质关联，但自我报告特质无法可靠预测行为，且与人类模式存在差异。人设注射能改变自我报告但对实际行为影响微小或不一致。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了对LLM人格的假设，强调需要区分表面特质表达与行为一致性，并在对齐和可解释性方面进行更深入的评估。

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

Motivation: 传统token级RL框架无法与多步推理过程（如Chain-of-Thought）的推理级性质对齐，存在显著的理论空白

Method: 引入CoT-Space框架，从噪声视角和风险视角分析推理过程，将LLM推理重新定义为连续语义空间中的优化问题

Result: 证明了最优CoT长度收敛是欠拟合和过拟合之间基本权衡的自然结果，实验提供了强有力的实证验证

Conclusion: 该框架不仅为过度思考等经验现象提供了连贯解释，还为开发更有效和可泛化的推理智能体奠定了坚实的理论基础

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

Abstract: Formalizing cooking procedures remains a challenging task due to their

Our approach enables precise, modular modeling of complex culinary workflows.
Initial manual evaluation on a full English breakfast recipe demonstrates the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将心理学理论（如MBTI）与LLM行为设计相结合，通过人格条件化增强AI智能体的行为一致性和可解释性，为心理增强型AI奠定基础。

Method: 使用提示工程为LLM智能体注入不同MBTI人格原型，通过官方16Personalities测试自动验证特质持久性，支持多智能体结构化通信协议实验。

Result: 人格条件化在不同任务中产生一致的行为偏差：情感表达型智能体在叙事生成中表现优异，分析型智能体在博弈论设置中采用更稳定的策略，自我反思能提高合作和推理质量。

Conclusion: 该方法可无缝推广到其他心理学框架（如Big Five、HEXACO、Enneagram），为无需微调的心理增强型AI智能体提供了有效基础框架。

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时扩展方法产生的推理轨迹和洞察在上下文窗口重置后即被丢弃，外部记忆虽有益但局限于实例级记忆，需要更可重用和可扩展的概念级记忆方法。

Method: 设计从推理轨迹中抽象关键见解的策略，将概念以自然语言形式存储，对新查询选择性检索并集成到提示中，支持动态记忆更新和测试时持续学习。

Result: 在ARC-AGI基准上获得7.5%相对提升，性能随推理计算量持续扩展，抽象概念在所有测试计算规模上均优于基线，动态记忆更新优于固定记忆设置。

Conclusion: 概念级记忆方法有效实现了LLM的测试时持续学习，通过抽象和重用推理模式实现自我改进，为推理密集型任务提供了可扩展的记忆解决方案。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

TL;DR: LibriQuote数据集是一个从有声读物中提取的英语语料库，包含12.7K小时非表达性语音和5.3K小时表达性语音，用于微调和基准测试表达性零样本TTS系统，并提供了包含上下文和伪标签的测试集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模语音数据集中表达性语音的比例不明确，且现有的表达性语音语料库规模较小，主要用于TTS系统的基准测试，因此需要构建一个既可用于微调又可用于基准测试的大规模表达性语音数据集。

Method: 从朗读的有声读物中构建LibriQuote数据集，训练集包含非表达性和表达性语音，表达性子集还提供了上下文和描述引语的伪标签（如语音动词和副词）。同时提供了一个7.5小时的测试集，用于评估TTS系统在保持音色的同时合成表达性语音的能力。

Result: 主观和客观评估表明，在LibriQuote上微调基线TTS系统显著提高了合成语音的可懂度，且现有系统无法合成与真实语音一样表达性和自然的语音。测试集涵盖了广泛的情感和各种口音。

Conclusion: LibriQuote数据集为表达性零样本TTS系统的微调和基准测试提供了有价值的资源，现有系统在合成表达性和自然语音方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and
natural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the
proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear.
Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and
primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the
LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed
for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The
training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K
hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each
utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it
was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to
describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally,
we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS
systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's
ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference
timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide
range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various
accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a
baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech
intelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as
expressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances. The dataset and
evaluation code are freely available. Audio samples can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统通过检索证据来减少LLM的幻觉，但这种方法存在漏洞：LLM可能吸收和复制检索证据中的错误信息，特别是在健康等高风险领域，错误回答可能造成严重危害。

Method: 在健康领域进行受控实验，使用常见健康问题，变化检索文档类型（有用、有害、对抗性）和用户问题框架（一致、中性、不一致），评估模型输出与真实答案的一致性。

Result: 对抗性文档显著降低了模型输出与真实答案的一致性，但当检索池中存在有用证据时，系统的鲁棒性可以得到保持。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计高风险领域更安全的RAG系统提供了可行见解，强调了检索安全保障的必要性，所有实验结果已在GitHub仓库公开以促进可重复性和未来研究。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统NER需要预定义实体类型的问题，实现用户自定义类型描述的开放实体检索，摆脱固定模式限制。

Method: 使用LLM中间层transformer块的值向量嵌入实体提及和类型描述，训练轻量级对比投影网络对齐类型兼容实体，分离不相关类型。

Result: 在三个基准测试中显著优于词法和密集句子级检索基线，证明中间层表示比顶层嵌入更有效。

Conclusion: 为LLM内部表示选择提供实证支持，展示了可扩展、无模式实体检索的实用解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a

Abstract: Query spelling correction is an important function of modern search engines
since it effectively helps users express their intentions clearly. With the
growing popularity of speech search driven by Automated Speech Recognition
(ASR) systems, this paper introduces a novel method named Contextualized Token
Discrimination (CTD) to conduct effective speech query correction. In CTD, we
first employ BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations and
then construct a composition layer to enhance semantic information. Finally, we
produce the correct query according to the aggregated token representation,
correcting the incorrect tokens by comparing the original token representations
and the contextualized representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed method across all metrics, and we further
present a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions to offer
comprehensive evaluations for audio query correction.
