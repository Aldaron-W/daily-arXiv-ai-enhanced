TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了使用大语言模型进行失智症检测的各种适配策略，在DementiaBank语音语料库上评估了9个纯文本模型和3个多模态模型，发现适当的适配策略可以让开源模型达到或超过商业系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国超过一半的阿尔茫海默病及相关失智症患者未被诊断，语音基于的筛查提供了可扩展的检测方案。

Method: 比较了大语言模型的多种适配策略，包括上下文学习不同示例选择策略、推理增强提示、参数高效微调和多模态整合。

Result: 类质心示例在上下文学习中表现最佳，推理提示改善了小模型的性能，切片级微调通常获得最高分数，添加分类头显著提升了表现较差的模型。多模态模型表现不错但未超过最佳的纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 模型适配策略（包括示例选择、推理设计和调整方法）对语音基于的失智症检测至关重要，适当适配的开放权重模型可以达到或超过商业系统的性能。

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [2] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出强化行为对齐(RBA)框架，通过自合成数据和强化学习提升语音大模型的指令跟随能力，在多项任务上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音大模型(SpeechLMs)在处理动态多变的用户语音时，与文本大模型存在显著的性能差距，需要解决跨模态差异带来的指令跟随能力不足问题

Method: 采用自合成方法由强教师LLM生成高质量对齐数据，然后使用基于强化学习的方法将SpeechLMs的行为与教师模型对齐，避免依赖人工标注的监督微调

Result: RBA方法有效提升了SpeechLMs的指令跟随能力，超越了传统蒸馏基线，在口语问答和语音转文本翻译等任务上仅使用自生成数据就达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: RBA框架能够显著缩小语音大模型与文本大模型之间的性能差距，为多模态语言模型的行为对齐提供了有效解决方案，且具有良好的扩展性

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

*Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用微调Mistral 7B LLM模型进行加密货币新闻的多层次多任务分析，结合RAG技术生成图和文本摘要，通过层次堆叠整合为综合报告


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在加密货币新闻分析中的幻觉问题，提供互补的图和文本视角，实现信息丰富的定性和定量分析

Method: 采用4-bit量化的PEFT/LoRA方法微调Mistral 7B模型，结合检索增强生成(RAG)技术，第一层生成带情感分数的图和文本摘要及JSON表示，高层进行层次堆叠整合

Result: 该方法能够有效消除LLM幻觉问题，为加密货币新闻分析提供重要的定性和定量洞察

Conclusion: 微调Mistral 7B LLM模型结合RAG技术是多层次加密货币新闻分析的有效方法，知识图谱表示能显著减少幻觉问题

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProLiFIC是一个从1987-2022年意大利立法过程的综合事件日志，使用LLM从非结构化数据构建，旨在为法律流程挖掘提供基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流程挖掘在工业领域应用成熟，但在法律领域受限于数据可访问性和质量，需要高质量的法律流程数据集来推动该领域发展。

Method: 从Normattiva门户提取非结构化数据，使用大型语言模型(LLMs)进行结构化处理，构建意大利立法过程的事件日志。

Result: 成功创建了ProLiFIC数据集，涵盖35年的意大利立法流程，为法律流程挖掘提供了标准化基准。

Conclusion: ProLiFIC数据集填补了法律流程挖掘领域的数据空白，通过与LLM结合展示了新的研究方向，可作为该领域的基准测试数据集。

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

### [5] [Multimodal Proposal for an AI-Based Tool to Increase Cross-Assessment of Messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03529)
*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多模态框架，通过将营收会话编码为层次话语树来生成语义丰富且结构意识的嵌入表示，涵盖文本、音频、视频情感信号和话语元数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的财务情感分析系统多依赖平面的文档级或句子级模型，无法抓取营收会话这种半结构化金融沟通的层次话语结构。

Method: 采用两阶段转换器架构：第一阶段通过对比学习在节点级利用多模态内容和话语元数据进行编码，第二阶段合成整个会议的全局嵌入表示。

Result: 实验结果显示，生成的嵌入表示形成了稳定、语义意义丰富的表征，能够反映情感语调、结构逻辑和主题对齐。

Conclusion: 该系统除了财务报告外，还可扩展到其他高风险非脚本化沟通领域，如远程医疗、教育和政治话语，提供了一种健壮且可解释的多模态话语表征方法。

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

### [6] [Reading Between the Signs: Predicting Future Suicidal Ideation from Adolescent Social Media Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03530)
*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用转换器模型Early-SIB分析青少年在论坛上的发帖和互动，预测其自杀意念和行为，无需显式自我曝露信息，在荷兰青少年论坛上达到0.73的平衡准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年自杀是主要死因之一，但预测困难。许多案例因缺乏心理健康服务接触而未被发现。社交媒体提供了实时分析青少年在线表达的机会。

Method: 提出Early-SIB转换器模型，逐序处理用户发帖和互动内容，预测其是否会发布自杀意念相关帖子，无需显式自我曝露作为输入。

Result: 在荷兰青少年论坛上达到0.73的平衡准确率，证明该方法可以有效预测未来自杀意念和行为。

Conclusion: 这种基于社交媒体分析的预测工具可以作为传统方法的有力补充，提高青少年自杀风险识别能力。

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

### [7] [Real-Time Detection of Hallucinated Entities in Long-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03531)
*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种便宜、可扩展的实时幻觉检测方法，通过实体级别标注和线性探针训练分类器，在长文本生成任务中显著超过现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险应用中的幻觉问题可能造成严重危害，而现有检测方法要么限于短事实查询，要么需要费用高昂的外部验证。

Method: 开发了一种利用网络搜索的注释方法，对模型响应进行基于实体的标注，标记哪些token对应于虚构实体。使用这个数据集训练高效的线性探针分类器。

Result: 在四个模型家族中，该方法在长文本响应中持续超过基线方法（如Llama-3.3-70B的AUC 0.90 vs 0.71），在短形式问答中也有改善，并且能够泛化到数学推理任务。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有前景的可扩展幻觉检测方法，虽然注释过程费用高昂，但一个模型的注释数据可以用于训练其他模型的分类器，研究团队公开了数据集以便重用。

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

### [8] [Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出UDIB方法，通过信息瓶颈原理改进语义分歧检测，用计算高效的上界替代难处理的KL散度，为LLM幻觉检测提供更敏感的工具


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分歧检测方法基于几何聚类识别主题，但主题优化的是空间邻近性而非下游信息理论分析，存在脱节问题

Method: 基于确定性信息瓶颈(DIB)开发原则性主题识别方法，用计算高效上界替代难处理的KL散度项，得到UDIB算法——一种熵正则化的鲁棒K-means变体

Result: UDIB能够生成不仅空间相干而且从根本上结构化以最大化提示-响应关系信息的共享主题表示

Conclusion: UDIB为语义分歧检测框架提供了更优越的基础，提供了检测LLM幻觉的新颖且更敏感的工具

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

Conclusion: 系统在资源效率、功能稳健性和用户体验之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: In today's information-rich era, learners have access to abundant educational

a multi-modal question generation system that can automatically generate
diverse question types from various content formats. The system features four
major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了AR²框架，通过对抗性强化学习增强LLM的抽象推理能力，将核心问题转化为复杂叙述，训练模型提取底层计算逻辑，显著提升未见编程任务的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成LLM主要关注表面模式识别，缺乏对抽象能力的显式训练，而抽象是计算机科学中识别和提炼核心计算模式的关键技能

Method: AR²框架：使用教师模型将内核问题转化为叙述丰富但逻辑不变的挑战性描述，同时训练学生编码模型解决这些复杂叙述问题并提取底层计算内核

Result: 实验结果表明AR²显著提高了学生模型在先前未见、具有挑战性的编程任务上的准确性

Conclusion: 抽象是增强LLM泛化能力的关键技能，AR²框架有效提升了LLM的抽象推理和问题解决能力

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过动态构建和扩展知识图并结合外部检索来提升LLM的事实性准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在产生事实一致答案时的限制，以及传统RAG方法将知识作为非结构化文本处理的不足

Method: 从问题中提取种子知识图，通过LLM潜在知识迭代扩展，然后通过外部检索选择性精炼图谱以提高事实覆盖和纠正错误

Result: 在三个事实QA测试集上实现了一致的收益，在事实准确性、答案精确度和可解释性方面超过基线方法

Conclusion: 推理时知识图构建是提升LLM事实性的有前景方向，具有结构化、可解释性和可扩展性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

Conclusion: 提出了多文档科学推理的新任务和ResearchPulse框架，并发布了ResearchPulse-Bench基准数据集，为科学文献分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

TL;DR: Sprinklr-Edge-OCR在边缘部署中表现最佳，传统OCR系统在计算效率、延迟和成本方面优于大型视觉语言模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言、噪声、多样化真实图像中OCR的挑战，评估LVLMs与传统OCR系统在边缘部署环境中的性能差异

Method: 构建Sprinklr-Edge-OCR系统，在54种语言的双重标注数据集上比较5种LVLMs和2种传统OCR系统，评估准确性、语义一致性、语言覆盖、计算效率和部署成本

Result: Qwen获得最高精度(0.54)，Sprinklr-Edge-OCR获得最佳F1分数(0.46)，处理速度比LVLM快35倍(平均0.17秒/图像)，成本仅为0.006美元/1000图像

Conclusion: 在边缘部署场景中，传统OCR系统由于低计算需求、低延迟和高性价比，仍然是比LVLMs更优的选择

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自动评估器时存在自我偏好偏差，倾向于偏爱自己的输出而非其他模型的输出，这影响了评估管道的公平性和可靠性，特别是在偏好调优和模型路由等任务中。

Method: 构建了一个区分合理和不合理自我偏好的数据集，使用两种方法构建转向向量：对比激活添加(CAA)和基于优化的方法，在推理时应用这些转向向量来减轻偏差。

Result: 转向向量可以将不合理自我偏好偏差减少高达97%，显著优于提示和直接偏好优化基线方法。但在合理自我偏好和无偏一致性方面表现不稳定，表明自我偏好可能涉及多个或非线性方向。

Conclusion: 转向向量作为LLM作为评判者的保障措施既有前景也有局限，需要更稳健的干预方法来处理自我偏好偏差问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

*Ali Noori,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析SNOMED CT概念在临床笔记中的共现模式和语义向量相似性，研究发现这两种方法具有补充性价值，能够提高文档完整性和揭示潜在临床关联


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记包含丰富的临床叙述，但非结构化格式给大规模分析带来挑战。虽然SNOMED CT等标准化术语提高了互操性，但概念间的共现关系和语义相似性仍然未充分探索

Method: 利用MIMIC-IV数据库，采用标准化相互信息(NPMI)和预训练向量嵌入(ClinicalBERT、BioBERT)方法，分析SNOMED CT概念的共现模式与语义相似性的关系

Result: 共现模式与语义相似性呈弱相关关系，但向量嵌入能抓取临床意义上的关联。向量建议的概念经常与后期文档记录相符。概念聚类形成了一质的临床主题，与患者表型和照护模式相映射

Conclusion: 共现统计和语义嵌入具有补充性价值，能够提高文档完整性、揭示潜在临床关联，并为决策支持和表型分析应用提供信息

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨目标和跨领域的立场检测问题，传统方法在新目标域上表现不佳，需要能够有效适应新领域的解决方案

Method: 使用度量学习和三元组损失来捕捉立场目标之间的语义相似性和差异性，构建判别性嵌入空间，从新目标域中获取有用示例

Result: 在两个数据集上的多个跨目标和跨域场景中评估，在六个广泛使用的立场检测模型上显示出统计显著的性能提升

Conclusion: MLSD方法通过度量学习有效提升了跨域立场检测的性能，为领域自适应提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SiLVERScore，一种基于语义感知嵌入的手语生成评估指标，解决了传统回译评估方法的局限性，在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手语生成评估采用回译方法（将生成的手语识别回文本再与参考文本比较），这种方法存在两个问题：1）无法捕捉手语的多模态特性（面部表情、空间语法、韵律等）；2）难以区分评估错误是来自手语生成模型还是翻译系统。

Method: 提出了SiLVERScore，一种新颖的基于语义感知嵌入的评估指标，在联合嵌入空间中评估手语生成，能够处理语义和韵律变化。

Result: 在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上，SiLVERScore实现了近乎完美的正确对和随机对区分能力（ROC AUC = 0.99，重叠率 < 7%），显著优于传统指标。

Conclusion: SiLVERScore为手语生成评估提供了更准确和鲁棒的方法，解决了传统回译评估的模糊性问题，并展示了跨数据集的泛化能力。

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个四指标的评估套件，用于系统性评估大型视觉语言模型在交互式基础设置中的表现，发现当前模型与人类在基础过程中存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的评测标准主要考察单轮或问答场景，而基础设置是一个交互过程，需要通过持续沟通形成共享理解。

Method: 提出四个评估指标（基础效率、内容对齐、词汇适应性和人类相似度），在150个自我对战会话中测试三个专有VLMs，并与人类对比。

Result: 三个模型都在至少三个指标上与人类模式存在差异，GPT4o-mini综合表现最接近人类。发现任务成功并不肯定表明基础成功，高图像-语句对齐也不肯定预测任务成功。

Conclusion: 该评估套件和发现为未来VLM基础研究提供了框架，强调了需要更好地理解和模拟人类交互基础过程。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)带来了文档级机器翻译的新时代，但其整文档输出挑战了现有的基于句子对齐的评估方法，需要新的评估框架。

Method: 1. Align阶段：自动推断句子级源-目标对应关系，重建目标文本以匹配源语句数量；2. n-Chunk滑动评估阶段：计算1-4个chunk的平均度量分数进行多粒度评估。

Result: 在WMT基准测试中与专家MQM排名的Pearson相关系数达到0.929；在新构建的真实测试集上也与人工判断高度一致；产生的偏好数据可用于CPO训练和GRPO奖励模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为文档级机器翻译系统提供了一个准确、稳健且可操作的评估工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

TL;DR: NE-PADD是一种利用命名实体知识进行部分音频深度伪造检测的新方法，通过并行分支和注意力机制实现帧级伪造定位


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子级音频深度伪造检测无法实现帧级定位，而命名实体语义信息在部分音频伪造检测中尚未得到充分探索

Method: 提出NE-PADD方法，包含SpeechNER和PADD两个并行分支，采用注意力融合和注意力转移两种机制，通过辅助损失指导PADD利用命名实体语义

Result: 在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线，证明了整合命名实体知识的有效性

Conclusion: 命名实体知识可以有效提升部分音频深度伪造检测性能，NE-PADD方法为音频伪造检测提供了新的语义信息利用途径

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Drivelology（胡言学）这一独特语言现象，即表面荒谬但蕴含深层含义的表述。研究发现当前大语言模型在处理这类文本时存在明显局限，无法理解其隐含的语义层次。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索大语言模型在理解具有深层语义的Drivelological文本方面的能力局限，挑战统计流畅性等同于认知理解的假设。

Method: 构建了包含1200多个精心筛选示例的多语言基准数据集，通过专家评审确保质量。评估了多种LLM在分类、生成和推理任务上的表现。

Result: 结果显示LLMs经常将Drivelology与浅层无意义内容混淆，产生不连贯的辩解，或完全忽略隐含的修辞功能，揭示了模型在语用理解方面的表征差距。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLMs在超越表面连贯性的语言深度建模方面的局限性，发布了数据集和代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维链推理技术提升了LLM在语言理解、复杂问题解决和代码生成等任务的表现，但对其如何影响语言模型可信度的全面理解仍然不足，需要系统性地调查和总结相关研究。

Method: 采用文献综述方法，按时间顺序梳理近期推理模型和CoT技术的研究，从五个可信度维度（真实性、安全性、鲁棒性、公平性、隐私性）进行分析，总结各研究的方法、发现和局限性。

Result: 研究发现推理技术通过减少幻觉、检测有害内容和提高鲁棒性来增强模型可信度，但最先进的推理模型本身在安全性、鲁棒性和隐私性方面存在相当甚至更严重的漏洞。

Conclusion: 本文为AI安全社区提供了关于推理可信度最新进展的宝贵资源，指出了未来研究方向，强调需要在提升推理能力的同时确保模型的可信度。

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

Motivation: 大型语言模型可能遵循有害指令引发安全隐患，现有基于探测的方法在分布外性能表现不佳，作者怀疑这些方法学习的是表面模式而非真正的语义危害性

Method: 通过控制实验系统分析：首先比较简单n-gram方法的性能，然后使用语义清理的数据集进行控制实验，最后详细分析模式依赖性

Result: 确认探测方法学习的是指令模式和触发词等表面模式，而非语义危害性，揭示了当前探测方法存在的虚假安全感

Conclusion: 需要重新设计模型和评估协议，为负责任的研究方向提供建议，项目已开源

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

Conclusion: MobileRAG通过RAG技术有效解决了现有移动代理的局限性，在复杂移动任务处理方面表现出色，为移动智能助手的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在文本情感分类上取得显著进步，但韩国诗歌因其比喻性语言和文化特定性而研究不足

Method: 构建多标签情感数据集，包含7,662条目（行级和作品级），注释44个细粒度情感类别，采用顺序微调方法先在通用语料训练再在KPoEM数据集上进行微调

Result: 基于KPoEM数据集微调的韩语语言模型显著超过之前模型，F1-micro指标从0.34提升到0.60，能够识别时间和文化特定的情感表达

Conclusion: 该研究垠定了计算方法与文学分析之间的桥梁，通过结构化数据实现对韩国文学情感细腻的定量探索

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在RAG场景中虽然能提升任务特定性能，但会导致灾难性遗忘问题，使模型失去原有知识和通用能力。现有解决方案要么需要通用指令数据，要么在保持模型原始分布方面存在局限。

Method: 提出SelfAug自分布对齐方法，通过将输入序列logits对齐来保持模型的语义分布，从而缓解灾难性遗忘并改善下游性能。

Result: 大量实验证明SelfAug在下游学习和通用能力保持之间实现了优越的平衡。实证分析揭示了分布偏移与RAG场景中灾难性遗忘严重程度之间的直接相关性。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅推进了对RAG背景下灾难性遗忘的理解，还提供了一个适用于各种微调场景的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL是一种针对Text-to-SQL任务的自博弈微调方法，通过验证式迭代微调和错误驱动损失机制，解决了传统SPIN方法在SQL生成中的局限性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自博弈微调(SPIN)方法在Text-to-SQL任务中存在局限性：无法生成新信息，且对手模型产生的大量正确SQL查询会降低主模型生成准确SQL的能力。

Method: 提出SPFT-SQL方法：1)自博弈前采用验证式迭代微调，基于数据库模式和验证反馈迭代合成高质量微调数据；2)自博弈阶段引入错误驱动损失机制，激励对手模型的错误输出，帮助主模型区分正确和错误SQL。

Result: 在6个开源大语言模型和5个广泛使用的基准测试上进行大量实验，证明该方法优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL方法有效解决了Text-to-SQL任务中自博弈微调的挑战，通过创新的验证迭代和错误驱动机制显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: VoxRole是首个专门用于评估语音角色扮演对话代理的综合性基准，包含13335个多轮对话、65.6小时语音数据，涵盖1228个独特角色，通过两阶段自动化流程构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演对话代理研究主要关注文本模态，忽视了语音中的副语言特征（语调、韵律、节奏等），且缺乏标准化评估基准，无法有效量化模型在长期角色一致性等核心能力上的表现。

Method: 提出两阶段自动化流程：首先将电影音频与剧本对齐，然后使用大语言模型为每个角色系统构建多维角色档案。基于VoxRole基准对当代语音对话模型进行多维度评估。

Result: 构建了包含13335个多轮对话、65.6小时语音数据的VoxRole基准，涵盖1228个独特角色和261部电影。通过对现有语音对话模型的评估，揭示了它们在保持角色一致性方面的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: VoxRole填补了语音角色扮演领域标准化评估基准的空白，为评估语音角色扮演对话代理提供了首个综合性基准，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在事实核查方面的有效性仍不确定，需要系统评估其在中文错误信息检测中的能力和局限性

Method: 构建CANDY基准数据集（约2万条标注实例），使用思维链推理和少样本提示技术评估LLMs，开发分类法分析错误解释

Result: 当前LLMs在生成准确事实核查结论方面存在局限，事实捏造是最常见的失败模式，LLMs单独用于事实核查不可靠

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs单独进行事实核查不可靠，但作为辅助工具在增强人类表现方面具有巨大潜力

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在极低资源语言（如土著语言）上效果差，缺乏高质量NLP数据集，特别是面临消亡危险的拉丁语Ladin

Method: 利用少量拉丁语-意大利语并行句子对，通过翻译意大利语单语数据创建合成数据集，应用严格过滤和反向翻译程序确保语言质量

Result: 为Ladin语言创建了首个公开可用的情感分析和多选题答案数据集，并证明这些合成数据集能够在机器翻译训练中带来显著改进

Conclusion: 为Ladin语言提供了基础性资源，支持更广泛的NLP研究和下游应用，为其他低资源语言的数据集创建提供了方法论

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TKGQA方法主要关注隐式时序约束，缺乏处理复杂时序查询的能力，且在分解框架中存在推理能力有限和错误传播问题

Method: RTQA包含三个核心组件：时序问题分解器、递归求解器和答案聚合器，采用递归思维将问题分解为子问题，使用LLMs和TKG知识自底向上求解，并通过多路径聚合提高容错性

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA基准测试中，RTQA在"Multiple"和"Complex"类别上实现了显著的Hits@1提升，优于最先进方法

Conclusion: RTQA框架有效解决了复杂时序查询处理的挑战，通过递归分解和多路径聚合机制显著提升了TKGQA的性能和鲁棒性

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型对基准测试问题的改写版本表现显著下降，虽然模型排名相对稳定，但绝对性能分数变化明显，表明当前基准测试评估方法可能无法充分反映模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在真实世界应用中的表现，因为实际应用涉及语言变异性，需要模型能够处理同一问题的不同表述方式，而现有基准测试使用固定标准化格式的问题。

Method: 系统性地生成六个常见基准测试中所有问题的各种改写版本，并测量34个最先进的大型语言模型在这些改写输入上的效果变化，涵盖不同规模和性能的模型。

Result: LLM在改写输入上的排名相对稳定，但绝对效果分数发生变化且显著下降，表明模型在处理语言变异性方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 研究结果对LLM评估方法学具有重要意义，强调需要开发能够更好反映实际部署场景的鲁棒性感知基准测试，当前高基准分数可能无法完全捕捉模型对真实世界输入变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

Method: 使用人民日报语料库中4100句话建立功能语法注释数据集，基于RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext模型进行细调，实现命名实体识别任务。

Result: 模型在测试集上达到F1值0.852，在识别主语、主动词、补语等核心语法元素方面表现优异，但在标签样本不均表现上有提升空间。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将功能语法与注意力机制NLP模型结合，为中文功能语法自动分析提供新方法，为后续研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Conclusion: 首次提出基于音乐理论合成谱面问题的方法，有效提升了模型的谱面理解推理能力，为AI辅助音乐创作开启了新可能性

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了构建稳定个性化词汇模型的实践见解，考虑了最小数据需求，为会话机器人的词汇对齐策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连贯性建模研究大多单独关注实体特征或篇章关系特征，很少将两者结合，而语言学中连贯性需要同时通过实体指称一致性和篇章关系来达成。

Method: 提出了两种联合建模实体和篇章关系的方法来进行连贯性评估。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，整合实体和篇章关系特征显著提升了连贯性模型的性能。

Conclusion: 同时建模实体和篇章关系对于连贯性评估具有重要价值，联合建模方法能够有效提升模型表现。

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

Method: 提出MAGneT多智能体框架，将咨询师回应生成分解为多个子任务，由专门建模不同心理技术的LLM智能体协调处理，比单智能体方法更好地捕捉真实咨询的结构和细微差别。

Result: MAGneT在生成咨询对话的质量、多样性和治疗对齐方面显著优于现有方法，平均提升一般咨询技能3.2%和CBT特定技能4.3%，专家在77.2%的情况下偏好MAGneT生成的对话。

Conclusion: MAGneT框架能有效生成高质量心理咨询数据，使用其生成数据微调的模型性能更好，为心理咨询LLM的发展提供了重要数据资源。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

TL;DR: SED-Aug是一个用于社交媒体事件检测的即插即用双增强框架，通过显式文本增强和隐式特征空间增强来提高数据多样性和模型鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体事件检测依赖标注数据，但标注成本高且劳动密集，需要解决数据稀缺问题

Method: 结合显式文本增强（使用大语言模型进行5种生成策略）和隐式特征空间增强（5种新颖的扰动技术，在结构融合嵌入上操作）

Result: 在Twitter2012数据集上平均F1分数比最佳基线模型提高约17.67%，在Twitter2018数据集上提高约15.57%

Conclusion: SED-Aug框架有效提升了社交媒体事件检测性能，通过双增强策略显著改善了模型表现

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

TL;DR: 提出了Inverse IFEval基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在对抗性指令下的反直觉能力，发现现有模型存在认知惯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在监督微调后往往表现出认知惯性，难以遵循与训练模式相冲突的指令，需要评估这种局限性。

Method: 构建包含1012个中英文问题的数据集，涵盖8种反直觉挑战类型，使用人类参与流程和优化的LLM-as-a-Judge框架进行评估。

Result: 实验表明现有领先LLMs在反直觉指令遵循方面存在明显不足，验证了Inverse IFEval基准的必要性。

Conclusion: 未来的对齐工作不仅要追求流畅性和事实正确性，还应考虑非常规情境下的适应性，Inverse IFEval可作为诊断工具和方法开发基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用潜力巨大，但其依赖静态训练数据的特性存在风险，当医学知识更新时，模型可能提供有害建议或临床推理失败。

Method: 引入了两个新颖的问答数据集：MedRevQA（16,501个QA对，涵盖一般生物医学知识）和MedChangeQA（512个QA对，医学共识随时间变化的子集），评估了八个主流LLM的表现。

Result: 评估显示所有模型都存在对过时知识的一致依赖，分析了过时预训练数据和训练策略的影响。

Conclusion: 为开发更及时可靠的医疗AI系统奠定了基础，提出了缓解这一问题的未来研究方向。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO方法通过音素增强编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤，显著提升了上下文ASR在领域特定命名实体识别上的性能，特别是在处理同音词和多词实体方面


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上下文ASR在处理领域特定命名实体（特别是同音词）时表现不佳，现有方法实体多样性有限且将实体视为独立token，导致多词实体识别不完整

Method: 提出PARCO方法，整合音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤四个组件

Result: 在中文AISHELL-1上CER达到4.22%，英文DATA2上WER达到11.14%（1000个干扰项下），显著优于基线方法，在THCHS-30和LibriSpeech等域外数据集上也表现出稳健增益

Conclusion: PARCO通过增强音素区分能力、确保完整实体检索和减少误报，有效解决了上下文ASR在命名实体识别中的关键问题

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了提示词对LLM性别偏见评估的影响，发现即使微小的提示变化也能对测量结果产生显著影响，甚至完全反转偏见方向


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会影响力领域的应用增多，性别偏见问题引起越来越多关注。但现有评估方法通常使用经过精心构建的提示，可能明显或隐蕴地信号出性别偏见相关内容，这可能影响评估结果的准确性

Method: 在不同提示条件下测试模型：(1)使测试上下文显著 (2)使性别相关内容显著。使用四种任务格式，采用令牌概率和离散选择两种指标进行评估

Result: 发现即使微小的提示变化也能对偏见测量结果产生显著影响，有时甚至完全反转偏见方向。离散选择指标通常比概率指标更容易放大偏见

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅展示了LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，也为NLP基准测试和开发社区带来新的思考：严格控制的测试设计在什么程度上会触发LLM的"测试模式"表现，这对未来基准测试的生态效度意味着什么

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性评估了开源语言模型在日本历法处理能力上的表现，发现即使日语中心模型也在日历运算和多历法一致性方面遇到困难，强调了发展更好的文化特定历法理解能力的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的研究分析和改善了语言模型的时间推理能力，但大多数研究只关注公历，而许多非公历系统（如日本历、希吉来历、希伯来历等）仍在活跃使用且反映文化根基的时间概念。当前语言模型是否以及如何准确处理这种非公历历法还未经过评估。

Method: 研究者创建了四个需要时间知识和时间推理的任务数据集，系统性地评估了一系列英语中心和日语中心的开源语言模型在日本历法处理方面的能力。

Result: 研究发现某些模型能够进行历法转换，但即使是日语中心的模型也在日本历法的数学运算以及在不同历法之间保持一致性方面遇到困难。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了发展更好具备文化特定历法理解能力的语言模型的重要性，以支持更广泛的文化和时间概念。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

Motivation: 推理需要在有限数据和分布偏移下适应新问题设置，需要评估AI系统在低数据和分布外环境中的推理能力。

Method: 构建基于结构因果模型的因果世界模型，通过原则性数据增强提供观察性、干预性和反事实反馈，作为少样本上下文学习演示。

Result: 展示了CausalARC在四个语言模型评估场景中的应用：测试时训练的抽象推理、上下文学习的反事实推理、程序合成以及因果发现与逻辑推理。

Conclusion: CausalARC为评估AI系统在因果推理和分布外泛化能力方面提供了一个形式化且可控制的测试环境。

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理方面存在错误，缺乏像人类一样的健壮心智表征。需要基于体验的认知结构来改善理解和推理能力。

Method: 使用图像模式（来自感知运动经验的重复模式）构建答案集编程中的声明式空间推理系统，将LLMs导向体验认知结构的解释。

Result: 证明LLMs可以通过体验认知结构来解释场景，这些结构可以形式化为可执行程序，并支持更有效的逻辑推理和更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: 虽然当前实现仅涉及空间原语，但为深入整合更复杂和动态表征基础。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习能有效提升大语言模型的复杂推理能力，但其成功背后的机制仍不明确。研究者希望理解RL训练过程中的关键现象（如"顿悟时刻"、长度缩放和熵动态）背后的原理。

Method: 通过分析发现推理层次结构的涌现现象，提出HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA)算法，该算法专注于优化高影响力的规划token，而不是像GRPO那样对所有token施加均等的优化压力。

Result: HICRA算法显著优于强基线方法，证明专注于战略瓶颈是解锁高级推理的关键。同时验证了语义熵作为衡量战略探索的优越指标。

Conclusion: 强化学习提升LLM推理能力的关键在于推理层次结构的涌现，通过专注于高层次战略规划的优化可以更高效地提升模型性能，语义熵是比token级熵更有效的评估指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

Motivation: 理解LLM是否具有类似人类的人格特质模式，此前研究主要依赖简化的自我报告和启发式提示，缺乏行为验证

Method: 从三个维度系统表征LLM人格：(1)训练阶段特质配置的动态演变；(2)自报特质在行为任务中的预测效度；(3)人格注入等干预措施对自报和行为的影响

Result: 指令对齐显著稳定特质表达并加强特质相关性，但自报特质不能可靠预测行为，人格注入能成功引导自报但对实际行为影响有限或不一致

Conclusion: 需要区分表面特质表达和行为一致性，挑战了关于LLM人格的假设，强调在对齐和可解释性方面需要更深层次的评估

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

Motivation: 传统token级RL框架无法与多步思维过程（如Chain-of-Thought）的推理级性质对齐，存在显著的理论空白。

Method: 引入CoT-Space框架，从噪声视角和风险视角分析推理过程，证明最优CoT长度收敛是欠拟合和过拟合基本权衡的自然结果。

Result: 大量实验为理论发现提供了强有力的实证验证，框架能够合理解释过度思考等经验现象。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅为经验现象提供了一致解释，还为未来开发更有效和可泛化的推理智能体奠定了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

Motivation: 将心理学理论融入LLM行为设计，通过人格条件化增强AI代理的有效性，实现更一致、可解释的行为模式控制。

Method: 使用MBTI人格类型进行提示工程，通过官方16Personalities测试自动验证特质持久性，支持多智能体通信协议实验。

Result: 人格条件化在不同任务中产生一致行为偏差：情感表达型在叙事生成中表现优异，分析型在博弈论设置中采用更稳定策略，自我反思提升合作和推理质量。

Conclusion: 该框架为心理学增强的AI代理奠定基础，可泛化到Big Five等其他心理学框架，无需微调即可实现人格控制。

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文提出概念级记忆方法，通过从推理轨迹中提取可重用的模块化抽象概念，存储在自然语言中，实现无需权重更新的测试时持续学习，在ARC-AGI基准上获得7.5%的相对提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时扩展方法虽然能让LLMs执行更长的推理轨迹，但这些轨迹中的模式和见解在上下文窗口重置后立即被丢弃。外部记忆是持久化这些发现的自然方式，但现有方法主要基于实例级记忆，缺乏可重用性和扩展性。

Method: 提出概念级记忆方法：1）从推理轨迹中抽象出可重用的模块化概念；2）将概念以自然语言形式存储；3）对新查询选择性检索相关概念并整合到提示中；4）引入新的抽象和检索策略促进重用和扩展。

Result: 在ARC-AGI基准测试中：1）相比无记忆基线获得7.5%相对提升；2）性能随推理计算量持续扩展；3）抽象概念在所有测试的计算规模上都优于基线；4）动态更新记忆比固定记忆设置表现更好。

Conclusion: 概念级记忆方法通过从推理轨迹中提取可重用抽象概念，实现了有效的测试时持续学习，证明了解决更多问题并将更多模式抽象到记忆中能够实现自我改进的形式。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明语音自监督学习模型（如HuBERT、WavLM、XEUS）在生物声学检测和分类任务中表现出色，能够生成丰富的动物声音潜在表示，性能可与专门训练的模型相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督语音模型在非语音数据（特别是生物声学数据）上的迁移学习能力，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 使用线性探测分析时间平均表示，并扩展方法以考虑时间信息，研究频率范围和噪声对性能的影响。

Result: 模型能够生成跨物种动物声音的丰富潜在表示，在噪声鲁棒性预训练设置下表现优异，结果与专门训练的模型竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 基于语音的自监督学习为生物声学研究提供了一个高效框架，具有重要的应用潜力。

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient
framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了统一的策略梯度估计器，将强化学习和监督微调统一为单一优化过程，并提出了混合后训练算法HPT，在数学推理任务上取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言模型后训练主要使用在线（模型生成）和离线（人工演示）两种数据，分别对应RL和SFT方法。本文旨在证明这两种方法并非对立，而是同一优化过程的不同实例

Method: 推导了统一策略梯度估计器，将各种后训练方法表示为不同数据分布假设下的共同目标梯度。提出了混合后训练算法HPT，动态选择不同训练信号

Result: 在六个数学推理基准和两个分布外测试集上，HPT在不同规模和系列的模型上都持续超越了强基线方法

Conclusion: 理论框架统一了RL和SFT方法，HPT算法能够有效利用演示数据并保持稳定探索，不牺牲已学习的推理模式

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

TL;DR: Delta Activations是一种通过测量微调模型相对于基础模型的内部激活变化来表示微调模型为向量嵌入的方法，可用于模型聚类、任务嵌入和模型选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型的成功使得社区创建了大量针对特定任务和领域的微调模型，但由于元数据不一致和存储库非结构化，导航和理解这些模型仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 通过测量微调模型相对于基础模型的内部激活变化，将微调模型表示为向量嵌入，这种方法称为Delta Activations。

Result: Delta Activations能够有效按领域和任务对模型进行聚类，揭示模型景观的结构；具有跨微调设置的鲁棒性；当微调数据集混合时表现出可加性；还可用于少样本微调的任务嵌入。

Conclusion: Delta Activations可以促进公开可用模型的重用实践，为模型选择、合并和任务分析提供了新的工具。

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

TL;DR: LibriQuote数据集：一个包含12.7K小时非表达性语音和5.3K小时表达性语音的大规模英语语料库，专为零样本表达性TTS系统的微调和基准测试而设计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模语音数据集中表达性语音比例不明确，而专门的表达性语音语料库规模较小且主要用于基准测试，需要更大规模的高质量表达性语音数据集

Method: 从有声读物中提取数据，包含中性朗读语音和角色引语的表达性语音，为表达性子集提供上下文语境和语音动词/副词的伪标签，并提供专门的测试集用于评估

Result: 在LibriQuote上微调基线TTS系统显著提高了合成语音的可懂度，现有系统无法合成与真实语音一样表达性和自然的语音

Conclusion: LibriQuote是一个高质量的大规模表达性语音数据集，能够有效提升TTS系统的表达性合成能力，并为该领域提供了可靠的基准测试平台

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and
natural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the
proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear.
Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and
primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the
LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed
for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The
training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K
hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each
utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it
was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to
describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally,
we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS
systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's
ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference
timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide
range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various
accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a
baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech
intelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as
expressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances. The dataset and
evaluation code are freely available. Audio samples can be found at

*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种新颖的多模态参数高效适应技术，通过SVD分解仅微调CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值来实现领域适应，仅使用0.04%的参数就能达到最先进的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型适应方法依赖提示工程和完整模型微调，成本高且可能限制适应质量、破坏模型稳定性并损害预训练获得的知识。

Method: 利用奇异值分解(SVD)修改CLIP内部参数空间，仅微调参数矩阵的奇异值来重新缩放基向量，而不注入额外模块。

Result: 在11个自然数据集和10个生物医学数据集上实现了最先进的分类结果，在少样本设置下的准确性和泛化能力均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD提供了一种参数高效且可解释的领域适应方法，能够更好地保持模型的泛化能力，同时实现优异的适应性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly

TL;DR: SPECS是一个针对长图像描述任务设计的无参考评估指标，通过改进CLIP模型来强调特异性，在保持与人类判断高度相关的同时大幅提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述评估指标存在不足：n-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，基于表示相似性的指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，而基于大语言模型的指标虽然相关性强但计算成本过高，不适合模型开发中的迭代使用

Method: 提出SPECS指标，通过修改CLIP模型的目标函数来增强特异性，奖励正确的细节描述并惩罚错误的描述，从而构建一个既高效又与人类判断高度相关的无参考评估指标

Result: SPECS在相关性方面与开源LLM-based指标相当，但计算效率显著更高，使其成为图像描述模型开发中迭代评估的实用替代方案

Conclusion: SPECS提供了一个计算高效且与人类判断高度相关的评估解决方案，解决了长图像描述任务中现有评估指标的局限性，特别适合模型开发过程中的迭代使用

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

TL;DR: 论文分析了大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示词敏感性，发现微小提示词变化可导致15%的准确率差异，提出了Promptception框架系统评估提示词敏感性，并为不同模型类型提出了提示词设计原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示词设计缺乏系统研究，模型评估存在不公平性，因为精心选择的提示词可能展示最佳性能而非真实能力。

Method: 提出Promptception框架，包含61种提示词类型（15个类别，6个超类别），用于评估10个LMM模型在3个MCQA基准测试上的表现。

Result: 专有模型对提示词语义更敏感，开源模型更稳定但处理复杂表述困难；提示词变化可导致高达15%的准确率差异。

Conclusion: 需要针对专有和开源模型制定不同的提示词设计原则，以实现更稳健和公平的模型评估。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

Motivation: 当前的风险导向数据集构建方法无法覆盖日益复杂的实际多模态安全场景，且缺乏统一的评估指标来验证其效果。

Method: 提出一种基于图像的自适应数据集构建方法，从图像出发构建配对的文本和指导响应，自动生成35k图像-文本对的RMS数据集，并提出通过微调安全判断模型来评估数据集效果的标准化指标。

Result: 在多种任务上进行了广泛实验，结果证实了基于图像的方法具有良好的可扩展性和效果，为实际多模态安全数据集构建提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的图像导向数据集构建方法和标准化评估指标，能够更好地应对多模态大语言模型日益复杂的安全挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了UCF-UM评估框架，通过周期性的图像-文本模态轮换来量化统一模型的语义漫渐问题，补充了传统单次评测的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的统一模型评估方法对图像生成(T2I)和图像理解(I2T)能力分别进行单次评测，无法反映模型在两种模态间轮换时的语义一致性和稳定性。

Method: 设计了UCF-UM周期评估协议，通过多轮I2T和T2I交互来量化语义漫渐，包括三个指标：平均累积漫渐(MCD)、语义漫渐率(SDR)和多代生成评估(MGG)。还构建了ND400新测试集。

Result: 在7个现有模型上进行测试，发现不同模型的跨模态稳定性存在显著差异，如BAGEL模型能保持语义一致性，而Vila-u模型虽然单次评测成绩优秀但语义漫渐快。

Conclusion: 周期一致性评估是补充标准I2T和T2I评测的必要手段，UCF-UM框架为评估统一模型的跨模态稳定性和共享表征强度提供了实用的量化指标。

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性评估了医疗领域中检索增强生成系统(RAG)的健壮性，发现对投攻性文档很容易被大语言模型吸收并产生错误信息，但如果检索到有用证据则可以保持系统的健壮性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成(RAG)系统虽然能够基于检索到的证据来减少大语言模型的幻觉，但也引入了新的漏洞：模型可能吸收并复制检索到的错误信息。在医疗这种高风险领域，错误回答可能造成严重害备，因此需要系统性地评估RAG系统的健壮性。

Method: 在医疗领域进行受控实验，使用常见健康问题，变化检索到的文档类型（有帮助的、有害的、对投性的）以及用户提问的框架方式（一致的、中立的、不一致的），分析模型输出与真实答案的一致性。

Result: 对投性文档会显著降低模型输出与真实答案的一致性，但当检索到有帮助的证据时，系统的健壮性可以得以保持。

Conclusion: 设计高风险领域的安全RAG系统时，需要强调检索保障措施的重要性。实验结果公开以便复现和促进未来研究。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github
repository.

Motivation: 解决传统NER需要预定义实体类型的问题，实现用户自定义类型描述的开放式实体检索，提升检索的灵活性和可扩展性

Method: 使用LLM中间层transformer块的值向量作为实体表示，训练轻量级对比投影网络对齐类型兼容实体，在共享语义空间中进行最近邻搜索

Result: 在三个基准测试中显著优于词汇和密集句子级检索基线方法，证明了中间层表示比顶层嵌入更有效地编码细粒度类型信息

Conclusion: 为LLM内部表示选择提供了实证支持，展示了可扩展、无模式实体检索的实用解决方案，代码已开源

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类与AI协作决策时，AI的种族偏见如何影响人类的招聘决策，以及如何通过干预措施减轻这种偏见。

Method: 采用简历筛选实验(N=528)，使用模拟AI模型展示种族偏好偏见，通过1562个场景测试候选人的选择，并测量隐性关联测试(IAT)的影响。

Result: 无AI或无偏见AI时人们平等选择候选人；有偏见AI时90%情况下人们会跟随AI偏好；完成IAT测试后选择不符合种族-地位刻板印象候选人的概率增加13%。

Conclusion: 人类决策容易受到AI偏见影响，即使认为AI建议质量低；需要组织政策和监管考虑AI-HITL决策的复杂性，并教育使用者。

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people
collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)
to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI
bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in
real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,
Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups
on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their
unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association
tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been
investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or
with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates
at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,
people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a
significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose
identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%
if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if
people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their
decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This
work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,
design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias
in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and
regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision
making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and
determining which are subject to oversight.

Discrimination (CTD) to conduct effective speech query correction. In CTD, we
first employ BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations and
then construct a composition layer to enhance semantic information. Finally, we
produce the correct query according to the aggregated token representation,
correcting the incorrect tokens by comparing the original token representations
and the contextualized representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed method across all metrics, and we further
present a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions to offer
comprehensive evaluations for audio query correction.
